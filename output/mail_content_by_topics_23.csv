STOCKWATCH Enron higher after Merrill Lynch's cautious upgrade to 'buy'

10/09/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were higher in morning trade after Me=
rrill Lynch issued a cautiously optimistic note upgrading the stock to 'buy=
' from 'accumulate' following Enron's sale of certain US and Indian assets,=
 dealers said. At 11.35 am, Enron gained 36 cents, or 1.08 pct, to 33.81 us=
d.=20
The Dow Jones Utility Average (DUX) declined 4.26 points to 316.05.=20
On the broader indices, DJIA lost 16.26 points to 9,051.68, the S&P=20
500 fell 3.50 to 1,058.90, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 23.21
points lower to 1,583.53.=20

In a note issued early this morning, Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey sa=
id, the agreement to sell Portland General and its India oil and gas intere=
st, has positioned the company to focus on its more profitable core busines=
ses, while substantially reducing its debt load by the end of 2002.
The sale of Portland General is expected to add 1.88 bln usd of cash to the=
 company coffers at the close of the transaction fourth-quarter of 2002. Th=
e deal will also bring 1.1 bln usd of debt relief.=20
Meanwhile, the sale of Indian oil and gas assets should bring in 388 mln us=
d.=20
Eassey expects more asset sales by the company in the near future.=20
The divestiture of the troubled Dabhol power facility in India along with s=
maller international gas assets could provide the company with additional l=
iquidity, he said.=20
""Enron could ultimately (in the next 3 years) raise another 1.8 bln usd or =
so from Dabhol and other non-core international assets.""=20
The Dabhol plant is 65 pct owned by Enron, making it the biggest investment=
 in India by a non-Indian company.=20
The company's partner, Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), owns 15 =
pct. MSEB owes Enron 48 mln usd for past power bills, but claims the power =
is too expensive and says it cannot absorb it all. The plant has lied idle =
since.=20
Many questions, however, remain unanswered, said Eassey, noting that despit=
e the upgrade he is remaining cautious.=20
""While Enron has a menu of assets to draw upon to raise capital, reduce deb=
t and improve its earnings prospects in the process, the primary question c=
entres on timing,"" he said.=20
""Will the asset sales line up with an expected balance sheet clean up (with=
 prospective gains offsetting losses)?=20
""Can Enron sell its interest in Dabhol anytime soon, given the current war =
environment?=20
""What impact will the weakening economies of South America such as Brazil a=
nd Argentina, not too mention the negative economic sentiment here in the U=

These issues, along with the earnings drag from about 967 mln usd invested =
in its broadband unit and the viability of its 3.5 bln usd of goodwill, wil=
l likely continue to weigh on the stock near-term, explained Eassey.=20
Reflecting the above uncertainties, Eassey said he is ""cautiously lightenin=
g"" his 3-year growth outlook from the 20 pct range to 16-17 pct a year. Ear=
nings per share estimates for 2001 stand at 2.10 usd, while the 2003 foreca=
st is 2.45 usd.=20
Accordingly, Eassey's 'long-term' price objective now stands at 44 usd, or =
31 pct above its current price with an upgrade on the shares to buy from ac=

Power providers cry foul over fees / State is accused of improper billing

Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy mark=
et are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager=
 is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gra=
y Davis' administration.=20
The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legall=
y required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping s=
tate power buyers spread out the cost of high- priced electricity contracts=
.
Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mys=
terious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney-Jo=
nes of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such =
industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant.=20
The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resourc=
es was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an av=
erage of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour.=20
""The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Wate=
r Resources is giving them,"" Smutney-Jones said.=20
An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing =
a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could=
 order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been =
improperly charged.=20
The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid m=
anagement agency.=20
State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared Cal=
ifornia could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the =
state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot mar=
ket suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought.=20
Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said t=
he grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing pr=
actices to ""bury"" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the a=
ccounts of other generators.=20
""The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control=
 the governing board of the ISO,"" Ackerman said.=20
The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusatio=
ns ""absolutely false"" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentim=
ent in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs.=20
""The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in=
 Washington than they will in Sacramento,"" Maviglio said. ""It shouldn't be =
a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement=
.""=20
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said gene=
rators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisi=
s.=20
""I don't feel sorry for them one bit,"" Hidalgo said. ""They had one heck of =
a year.""=20
Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a respon=
se to the accusations.=20
Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mec=
hanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs.=20
The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operat=
ing costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said=
.=20
Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for res=
ale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more exp=
ensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate st=
and-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, t=
he ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra =
cost.=20
The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In=
 January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was ch=
aired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with indust=
ry. Davis appointed his own five-member board.=20
In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become ""=
a political arm of the governor."" The commission is trying to get Californi=
a to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization.=20
Davis has warned Washington to ""keep its hands off"" the ISO.

Enron Corp. Raised to Long-Term `Buy' at Merrill

Northwest to Buy Portland General
CBS MarketWatch.com
10/8/2001 7:44:00 PM=20
PORTLAND, Ore., Oct 08, 2001 (AP Online via COMTEX) -- Northwest Natural Ga=
s Co. is buying another Oregon utility from Enron Corp. for $1.8 billion, c=
ombining the state's largest natural gas and electric utilities in a merger=
 that may save ratepayers money but could also bring some job losses.
Richard G. ""Dick"" Reiten, chairman and CEO of Northwest Natural, said Monda=
y the gas company is buying Portland General Electric Co. after the Houston=
-based energy giant gave up on its expansion into the Pacific Northwest.
""We're extremely pleased that the acquisition will return PGE to local owne=
rship,"" Reiten said at a news conference.
Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, said he was co=
ncerned the combination could encourage Northwest Natural to bypass state r=
egulators by using its business clout to lobby the Legislature and governor=
's office when rate increases are needed.
""If that's going to happen, and PGE rate cases are fought out in the Legisl=
ature and the governor's office, then I don't think that's going to be in t=
he interest of PGE customers,"" Jenks said.
Northwest Natural was founded in 1859, the year Oregon became a state, usin=
g gas extracted from coal to light downtown street lamps.
PGE was founded in 1889 with a hydroelectric generator at Willamette Falls =
that anchored the nation's first long-distance electric transmission line w=
hen it was connected to the city, 14 miles to the north. The plant still op=
erates, generating 16 megawatts of electricity.
Reiten said the Northwest Natural board of directors has rejected buyout of=
fers itself in recent years in hopes that an opportunity like the PGE deal =
would come along.
""It was a conscious choice to remain independent and build assets rather th=
an sell out of state,"" Reiten said. ""That patience has paid off.""
He said the deal will create a $5 billion utility that can cut costs by com=

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron impatient at power deregulation pace.
By Chris Baltimore

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Nearly 10 years after Congress passed the Energy Policy Act in 1992 to promote competition in the nation's $220 billion wholesale power market, Enron Corp is growing impatient. 
From the U.S. Supreme Court to Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Houston-based energy and commodities trading giant has spread its open-market gospel.
""Five years ago we clearly thought we would be much farther along than we are now,"" Rick Shapiro, Enron's managing director of government affairs, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. 
""Finishing the job of making wholesale markets work across the U.S. is our number one objective,"" Shapiro said. 
Enron has a large stake in the regulatory debate. With wide-ranging commodity positions from lumber to pulp to bandwidth, oil and natural gas, its strategy hinges on the ability to transfer those products from buyer to seller more cheaply and quickly than its competitors. 
For the power market, that means Enron needs easy access to electric transmission lines, the interstate highway system that allows it to wheel supplies between regions and capitalize on short-term price imbalances. 
UTILITIES BLOCK COMPETITION 
Enron's big problem? Traditional utilities own transmission lines and have shaped the rules to block new entrants and favor their own generation, Shapiro said. 
""Vertically integrated monopolies have been very effective in delaying wholesale competition across the board,"" he said. 
In its pleas to Supreme Court justices and regulators, Enron has tried to empower federal regulators to force utilities to open their wires to competition. 
The Supreme Court last week heard oral arguments in a case that could be a watershed for the U.S. power industry and decide whether FERC has the right to drive competition on state transmission networks. 
In a classic battle of state versus federal jurisdictional turf, Enron wants the court to give FERC more authority to compel states to open their transmission grids to competitors. 
Meanwhile, New York has brought a companion case that says FERC has gone too far and the court should give control of transmission wires back to the states. 
""This is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds,"" Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, said at the oral argument. 
New York wants the court to revoke FERC's authority to regulate retail sales, contending electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal legislation. 
""I think a victory for New York would be absolutely disastrous for consumers across the country,"" Shapiro said. 
""FERC has jurisdiction. All they need to do is exercise it,"" Shapiro said, echoing Enron lawyers' case to Supreme Court justices that existing laws give FERC the power to do Enron's will. 
Enron does not see a recent congressional push for energy legislation as key to its plans, Shapiro said. ""FERC is doing its job on the electricity front. I'm not sure that legislation is required on that front."" 
FERC SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS 
With new Chairman Pat Wood at the helm, FERC is moving in the right direction to drive competition, Shapiro said. ""It's early in his tenure,"" Shapiro said of Wood. ""Many of the signs are promising."" 
Wood has made so-called regional transmission organizations a high priority and set aggressive agency rules to drive utilities to join them. 
RTOs establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk electricity across the borders of their own local transmission systems. Enron sees RTOs as a positive step toward competition. 
In what he called a ""carrots and sticks"" approach, Wood signaled in late September that utilities must either join RTOs or face losing the right to sell power in wholesale markets. 
FERC will hold a week-long meeting on RTOs beginning Monday. 
Enron is skeptical that carrots are useful, and is a bigger fan of sticks, Shapiro said. 
Utilities have ""gotten quite fat over the last nine or 10 years,"" Shapiro said, and will shrug off FERC's incentives. ""I'm not sure there are a sufficient number of carrots in the world right now to incentivize these companies,"" Shapiro said.

UK: Enron's European electricity trading volumes soar.

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Enron on Friday said it traded five times as much wholesale electricity in continental Europe during the first half of this year as in the same period last year. 
Continental power trading director Gregor Baeumerich told Reuters the company traded 523 terawatt hours in the first half - roughly equivalent to annual German power demand - up from 93 terawatt hours in the first half of 2000.
""On average we are now doing around 200 deals a day with about 300 counterparties,"" he said. 
Liquidity in Germany, Europe's biggest power market, had risen partly due to more trading by municipal utilities, he said. 
Baeumerich said volumes in the French power market had risen sharply in recent weeks after Electricite de France last month auctioned off access to 1,200 megawatts of it generation capacity. 
He said annual contracts for physical baseload power for 2002 were trading daily. Up to 30 companies participated in the French market. 
""Utilities from across the continent are trading the French market,"" said Baeumerich. 
Much of the trading took place on France's borders with neighbouring countries, he said.

Northwest Natural Picks Merrill, CSFB to Arrange $2.1 Bln Loan
2001-10-12 13:05 (New York)

Northwest Natural Picks Merrill, CSFB to Arrange $2.1 Bln Loan

     New York, Oct. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Northwest Natural Gas Co.
picked Merrill Lynch & Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston to
arrange a $2.1 billion loan to help finance its acquisition of
Portland General Electric, said bankers familiar with the loan.

     The high-yield loan, the largest announced since the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, will include $450 million of
working capital. Another $450 million will be replaced by a junk
bond of the same size, the bankers said.

     Merrill, which advised Northwest on its acquisition, will
manage the bond sale. Credit Suisse advised Enron Corp. on the
sale of Portland for $2.9 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt
to Northwest.

     Portland, Oregon-based Northwest also plans to issue $150
million of common equity once the acquisition is closed, according
to Chief Executive Richard Reiten. The company expects a nine-
month to 12-month regulatory approval period, Reiten said.

     Northwest is forming a holding company to take on the debt
needed to finance the transaction. Standard & Poor's said that the
debt at the holding company is expected to be rated below
investment grade. The utilities -- Northwest Natural and Portland
General -- are expected to keep their investment-grade ratings,
S&P said.



UK: INTERVIEW-Metals screen trade set to evolve - Spectron.
By Andy Blamey

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Electronic trading of base metals futures has established a firm foothold in the market but the nature of online trading platforms looks set to evolve further, says Gavin Gross, head of LME metals at Spectron Futures Ltd. 
UK-based energy and commodities broker Spectron's electronic platform for the trading of London Metal Exchange (LME) contracts has become required viewing for traders alongside the LME's own system LME Select and the Enron Group's EnronOnline.
""I think we've proved that people will trade LME derivatives contracts online, because there are some great advantages to doing so,"" Gross told Reuters in a telephone interview. 
""And unlike the physical markets, where things haven't really taken off online, all three platforms are pretty much indispensable to the market."" 
Both Spectron and LME Select are neutral platforms in which Category 1 and Category 2 LME members trade with each other, while EnronOnline is open to a wider membership but has Enron itself as the sole counterparty in each transaction. 
This leaves a gap in the market for a multi-party trading system open to industry participants beyond the immediate trading community, Gross suggested. 
""I think the clear trend for metals derivatives trading for the future is for open platforms which would allow dealers and clients in the market to interact with each other online,"" he said. 
Direct access for clients to an electronic trading environment could mean changes in the role of the broker, he said. 
""Clients will have the advantage of more control, more visibility and more transparency in what they do. However, they'll have to pay for services,"" Gross said. 
""You could see a situation where dealers specialise in different areas - certain dealers would provide credit functions, certain institutions would provide clearing, others would provide execution and certain companies would provide market-making."" 
DIFFICULT CONDITIONS 
Difficult market conditions are already forcing metals traders to rethink their activities; this week alone has seen N.M. Rothschild & Sons exit base metals trading and both Bank of Nova Scotia and Enron looking to scale back. 
""On the LME now you've got low volumes, falling volatilities, falling prices and we're in the grips of a bear market. It's very, very poor for business in general,"" Gross said. 
""There are too many dealers around chasing a shrinking amount of business...Each company is going to have to look very carefully at their business and their staffing levels."" 
Spectron has not been immune from declining volumes. 
""Our volumes for the first 12 months of operation were fantastic, way beyond what we had expected. However, our volumes have fallen in the recent quarter,"" Gross said. 
""That's due to two factors: first, the overall market activity is lower, and second LME Select has managed to attract some of the business that we would previously have had 100 percent of."" 
The company is now looking at ways to further develop its trading platform. 
""We're beginning to investigate ways to add certain features and do things differently. That might involve creating an alternative platform where clients could access prices and thereby widen the service,"" Gross said. 
But, he stressed, ""we have to keep the interests of our dealer clients foremost."" 
UNCERTAINTY 
In the current environment, the LME's refusal to throw its weight behind either open-outcry floor trade or its new screen system - the exchange has taken pains not to express any preference and to ""allow the market to decide"" - may prove to be counterproductive, Gross said. 
""By having two systems running side by side ... the exchange is almost moving in two totally different directions,"" he said. 
""There's a feeling that the ring is doomed, which doesn't do anything to encourage its use, while the reluctance to fully back electronic trading means that you're still only seeing a trickle of business going through Select in terms of overall volumes."" 
While preferences vary in different sectors of the market, the current uncertainty is helping no-one, he said: 
""Metals traders just want to trade. They just want to know with some kind of certainty how the market will be structured in future so they can structure their business to support that and make money.""

USA: Citizen wins two Petroecuador oil contracts.

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Oil firm Citizen won the remaining two of Ecuador's crude oil contracts by matching the price differential of $6.97 below West Texas Intermediate (WTI) set by another bider, Petroecuador said Friday. 
Petroecuador awarded U.S.-based Citizen two contracts, each of 12,000 barrels per day (bpd), for three months after matching Coastal Petroleum's bid of $6.97 under WTI, with a floor price for WTI at $20 per barrel.
Petroecuador last week retendered eight three-month crude lots, each for 12,000 bpd, following a price dispute with former contract holders that led Ecuador's state oil company to break the deals. 
Enron Corp. and Rio Energy were awarded earlier this week one 12,000 bpd contract each, while Anglo Energy and Coastal each will take two contracts. 
The new contract holders will start loading their first cargo during the first half of November, a Petroecuador official said. 
Petroecuador will set the price of Ecuador's crude for December and January based on market values.

British Court Blocks Indian State's Enron Challenge, AP Says
2001-10-12 12:25 (New York)


     Mumbai, Oct. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bid for
international arbitration over its Dabhol Power Co. project to
recover claims of as much as $5 billion can't be delayed with
legal action by an Indian state government, a Commercial Court in
London ruled, the Associated Press reported.

     The injunction prevents the Indian state of Maharashtra from
initiating legal action that would delay arbitration of disputes
over the Houston-based power company's project, AP said, citing
Enron.

     The injunction obtained Wednesday is separate from a case
pending before the state-owned Maharashtra Regulatory Commission,
AP said. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board has said it can't
afford the energy prices negotiated seven years ago.

     An Indian court has ordered a stay until a decision is
reached on whether the commission has jurisdiction in the matter.
Enron has a 65 percent stake in 2,184-megawatt power project,
India's biggest foreign investment, AP said. The company wants to
pull out of India and recover its investment and that of its
partners, General Electric Co. and closely held Bechtel Group.

35,"just for that - you have to go get a beer with me. asshole.

",,,

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

To explain the P&L of -349,000  : 
We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing 
in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back 
rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  
The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is 
pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and 
vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.

Looking out for you bubbeh:

The Enron deal at Elba Island amounts to a sendoout capacity of 160mmcf/d for 17 years. This will be tough to fill as the majority of existing supply exceeds the max heat rate-I would look for Enron to get out of this in some way.  Enron is currently having discussions with El Paso as to whether this contract goes into effect Oct 1st 2001 or Jan 1st 2002. Elba Island has recently said that they will be running in Q4 although many still doubt it.

Attached is a file that lists the terminals, their capacity owners, facility owners, expansion plans, and supply situation.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further....

""...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate.""

=0F""Are those folks smoking crack?=0F"" he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =
Ol=0F'
Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power
business here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F's Joint
Senate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to
improve either Dave=0F's or my understanding of the national embarrassment
California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.

=0F""The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing
utilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F"" he mused between sips
of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F""Come to think
of it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F"" I recalled,
=0F""Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the
ISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build
them.  I can=0F't remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB
Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State
agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F""

I know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know
California will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out
of the PUC=0F's oven sometime next week.

=0F""Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the
ISO=0F's bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator
planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F"" Dave added. =0F""So you agree
with Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F't believe in markets,=0F"" I retorted. =
=0F""Oh,
I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,
and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest
market went against me,=0F"" Dave recalled.  =0F""I called everyone who I tra=
ded
with, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what
will it cost for 50 MW?=0F""

=0F""Why didn=0F't you ask for 300?=0F"" I wondered.  =0F""I didn=0F't want to=
 show him my
position.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for
50, first,=0F"" Dave chided.

=0F""What happened?=0F"" =0F""Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=
=0F'd
take it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took
that, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F"" lamented Dave.  =0F""He just
wanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F's what I mean when I say
the traders are jigging it.=0F""

=0F""But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is
what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess
at the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess
wrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on
to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of
a generating plant.=0F""

And there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a
target for which to shoot.  I can=0F't prove the following, yet, but I=0F'l=
l
wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average
trading price climbs even as the so-called =0F""dysfunctional=0F"" price spik=
es
are eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic
principle is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the
imposition of an additional constraint.

I feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.

14, 2000, calling it an innovative program.

This appears to be a total GREEN LIGHT for Enron to move forward with 
customers.


PROCESS:

The utilities filed advice letters.  Comments are due on June 27.  Unless you 
tell us otherwise, we plan to file and seek expedited treatment. (The CPUC 
has no required timetable in which to respond.)  We expect the CPUC to 
approve them -- there is pressure from many fronts to DO something about load 
participation in the market.  Both have asked for a July 17 effective date.


DETAILS:

SCE's is a much better document and makes a good case for CPUC approval, even 
though the the customers are already benefitting from providing the utilities 
with the option to curtail during system emergencies. SCE proposes the 
following approach to prevent ""double-dipping"" by the customers:  If the ISO 
directs SCE to activate its load curtailment program during the time period 
that the customer has an accepted bid from the ISO in the A/S market, SCE -- 
working with the ISO -- will adjust the customer's bill to avoid double 
payments.  SCE provides no more information, but, on principal, this seems 
fair to me.  We'll have to watch to see what the proposed procedure would be.

PG&E doesn't say much except that it is ""unable"" to offer this to bundled 
customers (oh, gee -- must be more of those ""system constraints"") until 
""later"" (unspecified).  I would expect large customer groups to argue about 
that -- but it gives us the opportunity to push direct access.  PG&E didn't 
have much to offer on the ""double-billing"" issue -- it said either PG&E could 
change the customers bill or the ISO could adjust its payment.

FERC threw out all the protests by various parties (e.g., MWD, M-S-R, other 
munis) and approved the ISO's proposal.  The big issues were:  supposed 
improper allocation of demand relief program costs (ISO allocates it to all 
SCs based on metered demand during all hours of the program);q request to 
charge those who are out of balance for most of the costs; the need to file 
pro forma agreement in advance (FERC said ISO doesn't have to); and the 
supposed overly restrictive program participation. If you want to know more 
about the order, give me a call.

Have fun!

Hi Folks,

Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your
lineups for the stretch run.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups
this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly
where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive
emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but
listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup
may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start
the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup
one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk,
Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after
last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool
in your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.
http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position
numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy
Hicks.
Let's get to it.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Carolina Defense

After a few weeks of worrying about Thomas Jones, Michael Pittman seemed to
clearly be the prime RB here last week.   He rushed 14 times for 58 yards
(4.1 ypc) plus a TD.   Thomas Jones, on the other hand, only had 4 carries
for 18 yards.   The Panthers rank # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks so you have to like his chances again this week.
For the year, Carolina ranks # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith / Rodney Thomas vs Miami Defense

Probably the strongest criticism of Smith you could offer is that he's
losing time to Rodney Thomas...   Smith was ineffective again last week but
did score the cheap TD.   He ran 14 times for 23 yards (1.6 ypc).   Thomas
had 41 yards on 13 carries (3.2 ypc) and did bring a spark.   Smith injured
his toe and even though it's not believed to be serious, it's hard to put
much faith in him with Thomas coming on.   This week, they'll face a Dolphin
defense that's been soft lately ranking # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.   Make sure to understand, I don't have much faith in
either of these guys so check the cheatsheets to see where I rank them.
It's just that the Dolphins have been very weak lately against the run.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs Arizona Defense

Huntley ran pretty well last week against a tough St. Louis defense so it's
tough to count him out.   He posted 74 yards on 19 carries (3.9 ypc) plus a
score.   This week, he gets a much softer defense in Arizona that Emmitt
Smith ran over last week.   The Cardinals rank # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed
per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Detroit Defense

Thomas put in a very Bearish workmanlike effort last week with 82 yards on
24 carries (3.4 ypc)   Clearly, he's the kind of tough back this team wants
yet he has the skills and speed to be more than just a grinder.   This week,
he'll likely see lots of action against the Lions ranked # 22 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Minnesota Defense

Ahman Green bounced back as expected and proved why he's one of the league's
elite backs.   He rolled up 150 yards on 21 carries (7.4 ypc).   He did have
a 43 yarder thrown in there.   He did leave with some breathing problems but
he is expected to be ok this week.   Watch to make sure, though.   This
week, he'll face a Viking team that looks like they've rolled over.   The
Vikings rank # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks
and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   It doesn't always play out in
real life, but on paper, it doesn't get much better than this.


Miami's Lamar Smith vs Atlanta Defense

Again, Lamar Smith was weak.   12 rushes for 33 yards (2.8 ypc) and a big
fumble.   But the Dolphins don't seem too excited about going with anyone
else so there's always that chance for a cheap TD, sort of like with
Atlanta's Maurice Smith.   I don't have much faith in him but this week,
he'll face the soft Falcon defense that's ranked # 28 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and let the Bills run wild on them
last week.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs
so you have to like the matchup.   Check the cheatsheets to see exactly
where we rank him.

New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Buffalo Defense

Martin put in his typical workhorse effort Sunday with 122 yards on 23
carries (5.3 ypc)   Look for more of the same against the Bills ranked # 23
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Indianapolis Defense

Yawn.   Start Faulk.   He rolled up 202 yards on 30 carries last week (6.7
ypc)   Best player in the game yada yada.   He's the man.   If it matters to
you (and it shouldn't) the Colts rank # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Denver's Terrell Davis vs Oakland Defense

Terrell Davis jumps back in the fray after a week of rest.   Oakland's
defense has improved from awful to just bad over the last few weeks.   They
rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Oakland allowed
Tennessee's Skip Hicks and Eddie George to run for 87 yards last week so
they are getting better.


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Kansas City Defense

We caught a little flak last week for listing Stacey Mack in the lock column
against the Raiders but Mack helped us out with another 100+ yard day.   He
rushed 27 times for 111 yards (4.1 ypc) plus 2 TDs.   Of course, just to
make you Mack owners nervous, Coach Tom Coughlin said this week that Fred
Taylor could see action this week or next...
http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/122501/jag_8179728.html   I
personally don't see it this week but with this season, you never know.
Kansas City ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs Washington Defense

Williams owners (like me) groaned when the Saints fell behind so early last
week.   Williams was effectively taken out of the game.   Although
truthfully, he's been less and less a factor lately regardless of the score.
He ran for 26 yards on 10 carries (2.6 ypc) and caught 4 passes for 15
yards.   That's pretty small.   This week, he'll face the Redskins who rank
# 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cleveland Defense

As weird as it sounds, Eddie George will get the carries this week by
default as Skip Hicks injured his hamstring and won't see action.   The
Browns rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks
and for the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Baltimore's Terry Allen vs Tampa Bay Defense

Allen looked solid last week with 91 yards on 22 carries (4.1 ypc) plus a
score.   He showed little ill effects of being off and actually may have
benefited from the rest.   This week, he'll face a resurging Buc defense
that's ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   That's up from # 21 last week.   For the year, they rank # 10 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Buffalo's Shawn Bryson vs New York Jets Defense

As you know, Bryson went wild last week rushing for 130 yards on 16 carries
(8.1 ypc) plus 2 scores.   He also tacked on 31 yards on 3 receptions.
Bryson did have a 68 yard run which padded the stats a little but they all
count.   Henry will likely sit again giving Bryson another start.   The Jets
rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New York Giant's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Philadelphia Defense

Neither RB saw much action last week with Barber rushing 12 times for 47
yards (3.9 ypc) and Dayne only rushing 7 times for 42 yards (6.0 ypc) and a
score.   Barber of course, is more active in the passing game.   This week,
they'll face an Eagle defense ranked # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Seattle Defense

So much for that rookie ""wall"".   Tomlinson rushed 27 times for 145 yards
(5.4 ypc) last week.   Clearly, he's the primary focus of the offense.   San
Diego has a bye in week 17 (that's not really fair is it?) so this is the
last game.   Drew Brees could see some action which probably means Tomlinson
will be even more the focus if that's possible.   The Seahawks rank # 17 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


San Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Dallas Defense

Hearst had a solid but not great game last week with 72 yards on 17 carries
(4.2 ypc)   Kevan Barlow carried the ball 6 times for 25 yards (4.2 ypc)
Barlow also caught 3 passes.   He's creeping into Hearst's time.   This
week, they'll face a Cowboy Defense ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Tampa Bay's Mike Alstott / Warrick Dunn vs Baltimore Defense

It's tough to predict too much with these guys but Mike Alstott was clearly
the featured RB last week rushing for 101 yards on 24 carries (4.2 ypc) with
a score.   Warrick Dunn had 10 rushes for 32 yards (3.2 ypc) and added 46
yards receiving plus a TD.   This week, they'll face a Baltimore defense
that's bark is worse than it's bite lately.   They rank # 21 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   That just means that lately, they've
given up a lot of yards.   The Tampa backs have been very up and down so be
leery.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Cleveland's Jamel White vs Tennessee Defense

Jamel White prompted lots of ""where's he been?"" comments from the Brown
faithful last week as he rolled up 131 yards on 21 carries (6.2 ypc)   With
James Jackson out and Ben Gay still too unreliable, it looks like the Browns
will continue to utilize White.   He'll face a tough Defense this week in
Tennessee that ranks # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs San Francisco Defense

Smith is probably happy as he got a chance to pad his stats last week with
128 yards on 26 carries (4.9 ypc)   He ran pretty well after a slow start
and being totally and repeatedly shut down at the goalline.   He's clearly
just an average to below average back at this point in his career.   He does
look like he'll be able to hold off Troy Hambrick though.   The 49ers rank #
3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Don't discount the
fact Smith is going for another 1,000 yard season.   Of course, with Quincy
Carter at QB, I'd give it to Emmitt too.


Detroit's Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Chicago Defense

James Stewart re-injured his troublesome ankle last week and Lamont Warren
came in and played well rushing 9 times for 48 yards (5.3 ypc) against a
super tough Pittsburgh team.   (Although he did get 34 of those yards on one
run)   The going isn't much easier this week against the Bears who rank # 9
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 11 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Keep an eye out this week to see whether
Stewart or Warren will play.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs St. Louis Defense

Rhodes put together another excellent game last week against the Jets with
126 yards on 17 carries (7.4 ypc) with 1 score.   He also tacked on 26 yards
on 3 receptions.   He did have 2 fumbles though.   This week, he'll face a
tough Ram defense ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.
Although it should be noted they let Carolina's Richard Huntley run for 74
yards and a TD on them last week so it's not like they're invincible.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Green Bay Defense

Bennett suffered last week from the same problem he's had most of the year.
He just didn't get enough carries to make a difference.   Although one could
argue that after producing just 17 yards on the 11 carries he was given (1.5
ypc), he didn't deserve any more.   Bennett's a percentage guy that'll be
shut down for a while and then eventually break one long.   It's just that
most teams can't afford to wait as long it seems to be taking Bennett to get
going.   This week, he'll face a Packer team ranked # 14 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the season, they rank # 16
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs New York Giants Defense

Duce Staley has apparently forgotten how to run the ball lately but it
doesn't matter as he's clearly the Eagles #1 receiver.   Last week, he
rushed 15 times for 35 yards (2.3 ypc)   But he caught 9 passes for 103
yards.   This week, he'll face the Giants who rank # 10 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   More importantly for Staley,
they rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis / Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala vs Cincinnati Defense

Coach Cowher has upgraded Bettis to Questionable for this week and says
he'll play if he's healthy.   Tough to say who'll get the call but one has
to think that if he plays, Bettis will be used just enough to keep him
fresh.   The Steelers are winning without him, have a very beatable opponent
in Cincinnati this week, and don't want to jeopardize their playoff
situation where they know they'll need Bettis.   Plus, the Bengals rush
Defense is tougher than many think.   They rank # 12 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs San Diego Defense

Alexander looked to be making a statement that he should have been the guy
all along with 96 yards on 28 carries (3.4 ypc) and a score plus another 36
yards receiving with a TD.   He'll face the Chargers this week that rank #
11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs New Orleans Defense

Davis was held pretty much in check against the Bears last week with 57
yards on 22 carries (2.6 ypc)   He did get the score though.   He's clearly
the prime weapon here.   How much would YOU depend on Tony Banks?   This
week, he faces a Saints defense that's been tough lately ranking # 4 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Pittsburgh Defense

Dillon ran well against the overhyped Raven rush defense.   As the numbers
showed in the week 15 matchup info, Baltimore's been nothing special against
the run lately.   They were ranked # 12 last week for Dillon and this week,
they rank # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
Sometimes the numbers tell you more than the reputation.   This week though,
the Steelers rep is backed up with the numbers.   Pittsburgh ranks # 2 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   This is a MUCH tougher
matchup than last week against the Ravens.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Jacksonville Defense

Holmes had a on ""off"" day for him with ""only"" 80 yards on 23 carries (3.5)
and 12 yards receiving.   He'll be fine.   Tony Richardson stole another
cheap TD.   Richardson's a gamble as he won't likely get many yards even on
a good day but he's a threat for a short TD.   The Jaguars have been tough
lately ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd
still consider Holmes a must start in most leagues, but this is a tough
matchup.

Oakland's Charlie Garner / Tyrone Wheatley / Zack Crockett vs Denver Defense

Charlie Garner ran well when he ran but as has often been the case lately,
he didn't run enough.  He had 54 yards on just 10 carries (5.4 ypc)   And
most of those were between the 20's.   Zack Crockett and Tyrone Wheatley
both saw action making it nearly impossible to pick which one will do
anything.   The Broncos rank # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs so it'll be a touch matchup.

Yes, the snow has started to come down! In very big ways!  In fact, Telluri=
de=20
has received over 3 feet of fresh powder since October 1 and the temperatur=
es=20
have been frigid=01(which makes for excellent snowmaking conditions. Winter=
 has=20
come, and you know what that means =01( YES! Time to strap on some boards a=
nd=20
make some turns!


SNOW REPORT
As the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine t=
he=20
local attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked out t=
he=20
window and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop with our=20
waiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But when the=
=20
other diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with the=20
anticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak preview,=
=20
check out the photo of the day at www.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.


BARGAINS & DEALS
The best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here. But the NEXT=
=20
best-case scenario is that you get a screaming deal to vacation here. And=
=20
that=01,s what Telluride and Mountain Village Visitor Services has for you.=
=20
Check out these packages for round-trip air, lodging and skiing from some o=
f=20

If you choose to put together a package on your own, check out the lodging=

deals at www.telluride-ski.com and click on HOT DEALS.


WHAT=01,S NEW
You can never have too much snow. With that in mind, the Telluride Ski Reso=
rt=20
installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that every li=
ft=20
pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep. Lifts 1, 4=
,=20
5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing from=20
beginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be =01&tasty.=018

The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred=01,s, a new=
=20
140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most=20
discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.=20
Sophia, Allred=01,s will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an=
=20
upscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the evenin=
gs=20
year-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For dinner=20
reservations, call 970-728-7474.

One other great new thing: It=01,s easier to get to Telluride than ever bef=
ore.=20
You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on American=20
Airlines=01*but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your body i=
s in=20
one of them!


WHAT=01,S HAPPENING
Of course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November 22=
,=20
the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning. Like=
=20
the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you can=
=20
ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and Snowboa=
rd=20
Club.

After the Donation Day, you can still get good deals. From November 21=20
through December 16, Telluride hosts its annual Ski Free & More program. Wh=
at=01,
s it entail? Exactly what it says. Skiers and riders staying at participati=
ng=20
lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can choose a free lif=
t=20
ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free half-day of childcare for=
=20
each night they stay. For more information call 888-288-7360.

And if you=01,re looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at t=
he=20
annual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and Snowboar=
d=20
Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference Center.=20
Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like Telluride!


SLICE OF LIFE
Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was th=
e=20
case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the Caribbea=
n.=20
She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the snows began to=
=20
fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran outside and began to=

dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter=01,s absolute embarrassment!) How=
ever,=20
the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built their first snowman ever=
.=20
The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot nose.. An organic carrot, no=

AND SO, E-RIDERS,
That=01,s all for this letter. Hope you=01,re planning your trip to Telluri=

Rushing Game Matchups???  Here's how I see  the matchups this week.? Please=
 =20
note, see the cheatsheet online http://www.cheatsheets.net/week15sheet.htm?=
=20
for exactly where I rank players and to  determine who to start.? Just =20
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't=20
necessarily  mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.? The matchup=
=20
info is meant to be just one  more tool in your box when it comes to decidi=
ng=20
between players.??=20

Locks:? These games heavily  favor the Offense=20

Stephen Davis  (Was) vs Cowboy Defense??  New Coach Terry  Robiskie=01,s be=
en=20
saying he=01,ll run Davis into the ground.? Against a run defense as soft a=
s=20
the  Cowboy=01,s, no telling how many yards he=01,ll gain.? The arm seems o=
k and I=20
look for a huge  game here.? RBs roll up 200 yards on  Dallas like it=01,s =
an=20
average day=01(

Darnell Autry /  Chris Warren (Phi) vs Brown Defense??? It remains to be se=
en=20
what  effect (if any) newly signed Chris Warren will have this week.? It=20
wouldn=01,t surprise me a bit if Andy  Reid isn=01,t able to come up with a=
t least=20
a small package of plays that feature  Warren.? He=01,s a thousand times  b=
etter=20
than Darnell Autry.? If he  can=01,t go this week, I=01,d look for him to b=
e a=20
factor next week for sure.?? The Browns defense ranks # 30 in  rushing yard=
s=20
allowed per game over the last four weeks so the matchup is  enticing.

Fred Taylor (Jac)  vs Cardinal Defense?? Every once in a while, those =01&t=
oo =20
good to be true=018 matchups don=01,t pan out.?  This is certainly one of t=
hose=20
=01&too good to be true=018 situations but I=01,d  be shocked if Taylor doe=
sn=01,t just=20
roll over the Cards.? They can=01,t stop the run even when they  know what=
=01,s=20
coming at them.? Arizona  ranks # 29 in rushing yards allowed per game over=
=20
the last month.? That number won=01,t go down any after this  week.

Mike Anderson  (Den) vs Seahawk Defense?? Starting any player facing the =
=20
Seahawks is not a bad rule of thumb.?  They=01,ve been pretty bad and this =
week=20
they don=01,t stand a chance against  the dominating OL of Denver.?  Anders=

practiced fully Thursday so he looks good to go.? Keep an eye on the weathe=
r=20
as they=01,re  expecting snow in Denver but I=01,m not too worried about ho=
w it=01,ll=20
effect  Anderson.

Ron Dayne (NYG) vs  Steeler Defense?? This was the type of game they  draft=
ed=20
Dayne for.? A ground war vs  Pittsburgh in December.? It=01,s not  likely t=
he=20
Steelers will jump to a big lead and force the Giants to catchup mode  whic=
h=20
means pretty much no Dayne.?  This is shaping up to be a classic battle wit=
h=20
Bettis on one side and  Warren on the other.

?



Prime Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense?

Sammy Morris  / Shawn Bryson (Buf) vs Colts Defense??  Keep an eye on who c=
an=20
go for the Bills this week but whoever starts will  likely have some good=
=20
rushing numbers on the carpet in Indiana.? There were some semi encouraging=
=20
signs  that Morris might be back. The Colts rank just # 25 over the last 4=
=20
weeks  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? They=01,re  soft on the run and=
=20
someone could make a big splash on Monday  Night.?

Charlie  Garner (SF) vs Saints Defense?? Just as they are with their pass =

defense, the Saints rush defense is overrated.? Over the last four weeks,=
=20
they rank # 23  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? And  Garner is liable =
to=20
explode at any time.?  He=01,s too good in both the rushing and passing gam=
e to=20
consider sitting  down unless you=01,re just loaded.?

Warrick Dunn  (TB) vs Miami Defense?? It was surprising to me to see the =

Dolphins slide this far on rush defense.?  Over the last four weeks, they=
=20
rank # 23 in rushing yards allowed per  game.? Doesn=01,t seem  right but t=
hat=01,s=20
what the numbers say.?  Either way, Dunn=01,s a must start given what he=01=

Robert Smith  (Min) vs Ram Defense?? Like the passing defense, the Rams  ru=

defense has improved over the year.?  It doesn=01,t matter though.?  You=01=
,ve got=20
to start Robert Smith.?  End of story.? He may be the  best RB in the leagu=
e=20
if truth be told.???

Emmitt Smith  (Dal) vs Redskin Defense?? I think I may be the only one who =
=20
sees it this way, but I believe the Chris Warren booting was a real=20
statement  for Smith.? Sure, he still may not  get the 3rd down carries as=
=20
they get a look at Michael Wiley but  Emmitt is pretty much working without=
 a=20
net here.? He proved his mettle once again last  week hammering against a=
=20
tough Tampa team.?  The Cowboys also showed how little faith they have in=
=20
their passing game  as they continued to feed Smith the ball even when=20
trailing badly. Washington  ranks # 21 over the last four weeks in rushing=
=20
yards allowed per  game so they=01,re very beatable.?

Tony  Richardson (KC) vs Panther Defense??  Another week, another RB shakeu=
p=20
in KC as this time it=01,s Kimble Anders  who=01,s out of the mix.? I hones=
tly =20
have a hard time trusting coach Gunther Cunningham with any of them but it=
=20
looks  like Richardson will get the bulk of the work right now.? The Panthe=
rs=20
can be run on.? Keep an eye on the weather in this one  as the passing game=
=20
could be limited.



James Allen  (Chi) vs Patriot Defense?? What a mess Chicago finds itself =
=20
in.? The messiah QB is now healthy  but still on the bench while the =01&gu=
ru=018=20
offensive coordinator has left (been run  out of?) town for Utah and both=
=20
starting WRs are gone for the year with  injuries.? James Allen may be the =
=20
bright spot as he=01,s run hard and effectively.? The New England defense c=
an=20
be  vulnerable to the run and this may be another week where they rely on=
=20
Allen to  carry a heavy load.

?

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way?

Edgerrin James (Ind) vs Bills  Defense??  Edgerrin may be  having one of th=
e=20
best =01&poor=018 seasons in NFL history.? He=01,s posting great numbers ov=
erall but =20
you=01,ll have a hard time finding a James owner who=01,s real happy with h=
im.? If=20
he=01,s your guy, you have very little  choice but to start him in the Mond=
ay=20
Night game.? The Colts are tougher at home and  hopefully they won=01,t fin=
d=20
themselves playing catchup again.? Although with his receiving ability,  he=
=01,s=20
still active in that situation but it=01,s not the ideal scenario for any R=
B =20
when his team is playing from behind.?  The Bills rank # 18 over the last=
=20

I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.

128,"Accomplishments:
Conducted several workshops with EECC and the CALME region this week
Scheduled workshops with NEPCO
Have identified the needs to be addressed in the NEPCO workshops and are 
arranging appropriate resources
Met with the London COE to discuss their status in terms of reporting (we are 
sharing data from workshops)
Have made an initial offer to Corp HR cost center users to conduct workshops 
for them
Brought in some EY help to work with the business units to understand the 
multiple environments, extraction and analysis tools being used by the 
different business units

Upcoming:
Additional workshops for EECC and ESA
Identification of the Corp groups that would like to have these sessions made 
available (and subjects they would like to cover)
Will complete the ""user"" guides with screen prints to give out to all 
participants (step by step instructions, tools, and tips)
Finalize the NEPCO workshops (Mar 20-22)
Produce a plan for upcoming workshops for ECCS and Design review


Summary analysis of evaluations from this week's workshops:
Our overall belief is that the workshops, the one on one attention, the new 
content etc. are being received very well (scores averages around 3.5 on a 
scale of 1-4)
The score for the question of whether SAP will meet the reporting needs is 
still too low (average of 2.8).  We will continue to analyze the root cause 
of this problem.  
There is definitely an improvement in people understanding which modules 
contain which data.  We believe that a hand-out we developed really helped 
this and will continue to continue to emphasize this learning.

Comments received:
Very good and useful
Could have used this sooner
Sessions are not long enough
I love the workshop idea, its so much better than training classes

157,"Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating 
risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility 
(""OBSF"") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility 
late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, 
arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the 
operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result 
of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on 
gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting 
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain 
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as 
to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and 
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage 
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting 
developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as 
to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process 
tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all 
Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 
covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand 
and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within 
the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical 
VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been 
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of 
Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements 
for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control 
staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit 
timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source 
documentation within Enron
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party 
inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will 
not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward 
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report 
signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( 
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) 
and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where 
applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or 
external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during 
April

Check out the website for the place in Asheville, NC that I mentioned to 
you.  Address is richmondhillinn.com - if I knew how to hotlink for you I 
would, but I am not the techie!!  We had dinner there one night while in 
Asheville and had a great meal and though that the place was pretty -  a lot 
better than the overpriced, under-delivered Grove Park Inn.  Our friends the 
Tylers spent several nights at the Richmond Inn that same summer.  It looks 
pretty good in the photos, and you can see the mountains!!

Only airlines that fly from here into Asheville are Delta and US Air.  
Continental flies to Greenville/Spartanville, SC which is about 60 to 70 
miles from Asheville - not impossible, given that we would want some cars.  

I will get info on prices and stuff for lodging and airfare - then we can 
decide if we want to show this to Mom and Dad as a possibility.  

Hope all is well with the three of you.  Are you making the trip to 
Halletsville on Saturday, assuming no rain out?  I am not going to make it - 
need a little r&r at home and to wash some clothes!!  Love, Sally ",Dad Tylers Sally,,Heart Hospital US Air SC

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

We are sending you by messenger today a subpoena that we received last night asking that you produce documents and appear to give testimony before the SEC. IGNORE THE DATES INDICATED IN THE SUBPOENA.

These negotiations will likely result in new such dates from mid- to late-January. To the extent you have not already done so, please segregate and assemble any documents that you might have, even for the broadest request. I will be in touch with more details.

240,"As an update to many of you, I have been on the phone with Roger Kohn of EPA
Region 9 a couple of different times today.  It turns out that what they
really were expecting to see was something more like a formal Biological
Assessment (BA) for CS 3 and CS 4, not a biological survey report like we
provided.  According to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the lead Federal
agency in a Federal Action is responsible for preparing the BA, but a BA is
typically only required when the action ""may affect"" a listed species, which
is not the case here.  EPA Region 9, and based on our experience across the
country, apparently only Region 9, is interpreting their responsibilities
under the ESA very strictly and somewhat ""oddly.""  Regardless, the bottom
line is that it appears we could argue with them ad nauseum and still end up
right back here.  So, we have begun working very quickly and diligently to
put together a ""BA-like"" document that, according to Roger, will give them
what they need to put in their files to cover themselves for satisfying the
ESA.

I told him that the USFWS typically (under ""normal"" circumstances) receives
a BA from the lead federal agency and then issues their Biological Opinion
(BO).  I asked him if they (EPA) were going to still feel like they needed
any kind of concurrence from the USFWS.  He said that only if we were going
to have any findings of ""may affect"" would they maybe feel the need to get
additional concurrence from the USFWS.  I told him that you (Larry) already
have a verbal concurrence from USFWS that there are no issues, in addition
to the fact that our surveys confirmed that.  I told him that our ""BA-like""
document is going to come to the same conclusions that our Survey Report did
(i.e., No Effect).  He said that he understands, and will likely just
receive the document, assure himself that it says what it needs to say, and
is formatted in the manner he feels it needs to be formatted, put it in his
files, and put out the Public Notice for a 30-day comment period.  If this
all happens by early next week, we should still have permits by the
beginning of November. I will continue to hammer home the importance of that
schedule.  Some of us will be on a conference call with Roger and one of the
EPA attorneys tomorrow to try to ""get inside their heads"" a little bit
better regarding why they are the only Region interpreting their ESA
responsibilities so strictly.  We will debrief you after the call.  Scott

Have you made a purchase yet?  If so, we would appreciate a reply to this 
message telling us you have already purchased so we will know not to send any 
more follow up messages.

If you are still shopping, is there anything we can do to help you with your 
buying decision?  Our goal is to help you make an informed decision that you 
will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important

we implemented a Continuous Improvement program, and we underwent a major=

reorganization.  These changes have all had a positive impact on our compan=
y,=20
increasing our competitive advantage in the marketplace and challenging a=
=20
well performing organization to perform at an even higher level.  All of th=
is=20
translates to raising the bar for increased performance. =20

As GPG begins its annual year-end process of appraising performance and=20
allocating variable pay and merit increases, there are a number of changes =
to=20
the process I would like to communicate.  These changes will impact all GPG=
=20
employees, except those of you receiving Skill Based Pay.  These changes wi=
ll=20
help us take a more focused look at individual and overall company=20
performance and are intended to ensure consistency and equity in the proces=
s=20
across GPG.  The following details these changes:

Vice Presidents and Higher
All employees with the title of vice president or higher will be reviewed=
=20
Enron-wide, using common performance criteria and performance ratings.  The=
=20
officers will be reviewed and ranked within peer groups.  These groups are=
=20
Commercial, Commercial Support, Commercial Support Specialist and Technical=
.=20

All Other Non-Skill Based Pay Employees
All other non-Skill Based Pay employees will be evaluated using the current=
=20
GPG performance criteria and performance levels within their respective=20
company or business unit.  This will not be an Enron-wide activity.   =20

For directors or director-equivalent employees there will be an additional=
=20
step, which will be a GPG-wide cross-calibration by the GPG Management=20
Committee in early December.=20

We are taking a more focused look at performance.  In our efforts to=20
challenge a well-performing organization to achieve an even higher level of=
=20
performance, we are establishing the following distribution as a guideline:

Level 1 - Consistently Exceeds Expectations  10%
Level 2 - Often Exceeds Expectations  30%
Level 3 - Meets Expectations   50%
Level 4 - Needs Improvement and
Level 5 - Seldom Meets Expectations  10%=20

In the case of non-Skill Based Pay team employees in Operations, this proce=
ss=20
will lead to two ratings: a team rating, which will determine the level of=
=20
variable pay, and an individual rating that will be used to determine merit=
=20
increases.

This represents a change in our performance management process.  GPG is the=
=20
premier natural gas transmission company because of our ability to accept a=
nd=20
demand change.  We were one of the first companies to implement a Skill Bas=
ed=20
Pay Program and self-directed work teams.  We implemented Best Practices an=
d=20
Continuous Improvement.   This new approach to performance management is an=
=20
effort to strive for the top level of performance in our industry.   I want=
=20
to be clear that we have raised our performance expectations for the compan=
y=20
as well as for individuals.=20

Variable pay and merit increases will be impacted by these changes as well.=
 =20
GPG will use market data, job grade and individual and company performance =
to=20
set target bonus payout levels.  Payouts will reflect performance.  Divisio=
n=20
heads will no longer receive a pool of dollars to allocate to their=20
employees.  This method will eliminate significant differences in variable=
=20
pay for similar positions, job levels and performance levels across the=20

Each business unit will have a pool of dollars, which is funded as a percen=

in regulators on their system and they have asked Ralph if he would assist 
them in the management and disposal of PCBs on their system.  He wil also be 
providing thoughts on how and why PCBs move in a gas pipeline.

I had asked Ralph not to mention about Transwestern's agreement with SoCal 
for which Transwestern pays SoCal for 86% of their PCB costs.  I had asked 
him to only focus on the Southwest system.  Apparently Southwest is not up to 
speed with the PCB regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that 
the mega rule will impact their operations and Ralph will probably provide 
input for that as well from an LDC standpoint. 

I asked Ralph whether Southwest seemed excited or worried about the PCB 
discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned 
about compliance with the PCB regulations.  Ralph said he will let me know 
the results of the meeting.",Ralph Komai Transwestern Ralph,,PCB SoCal Transwestern

As you are probably aware, if voting results in Florida stand as they

255,"Hello Everyone,

	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners. Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62. 

	There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars. This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people. 
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

258,"I attended a meeting on July 30 with the Texas Intrastate Pipeline 
Association where TNRCC personnel made a presentation on the implementation 
of the grandfather legislation and Charlie Child attended a meeting on August 
7 where TNRCC also made a presentation on the grandfather legislation. 

The following existing authorization options are available for grandfathered 
sources: old Standard Exemptions, Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits 
(VERP), regular permits or Permits By Rule.  The grandfather legislation, 
which is still in the rulemaking process, is for permitting grandfathered 
sources that have not been authorized by the existing options.  These 
programs are discussed below.

Old Standard Exemptions
As you know, ETS has implemented a program to authorize grandfathered 
emission sources under old Standard Exemptions (now Permits by Rule) wherever 
possible so they would not be subject to the grandfather regulations. TNRCC 
indicated at the meeting that you would have until the deadlines for 
submitting applications (9/1/03 in east Texas and 9/1/04 in West Texas) to 
authorize the sources under old St. Ex.  Keep in mind that this program is 
not part of the TNRCC regulations-it is being implemented under a verbal 
agreement with the TNRCC and could change at any moment.  TNRCC recommended 
that PI-7 forms be submitted for all locations that are included on their 
1997 list of emission sources (Note: the list is based on TNRCC's listing of 
1997 emissions inventories and Ruth has distributed this list to the 
appropriate DESs). For locations not on this list, internal records would be 
sufficient and nothing needs to be submitted to TNRCC (unless required under 
the conditions of the St.Ex.). One thing to keep in mind is that TNRCC is 
revising the rules governing Permits by Rule/St. Ex. with increased 
recordkeeping requirements so that any emission sources authorized by St.Ex. 
will be subject to the new recordkeeping rules (scheduled to be finalized on 
9/26/01).  It is recommended that the Standard Exemption submittals be 
received by the TNRCC as soon as possible.  In addition to engines, old 
Standard Exemptions or existing Permits By Rule should be used for the 
remaining grandfathered sources (tanks, heaters, etc.).

Grandfather Legislation
The grandfather legislation includes a specific permit for reciprocating 
engines.  Other grandfather sources must obtain an ""Existing Facility Permit"" 
under the legislation.  Unlike the Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits 
(VERP) program, there is no amnesty granted for modifications uncovered 
during the permitting process.  Discovery of a modification may result in 
enforcement action.  In addition, the source is no longer eligible for a 
grandfather permit and must obtain a regular permit or Permit By Rule and be 
subject to BACT (~2 g/bhp-hr).  In order to take advantage of the VERP 
program amnesty provision, TNRCC is urging industry to submit VERP 
applications by the August 31, 2001 deadline.

Under the grandfather legislation, grandfathered reciprocating engines in 
East Texas are subject to 50% reductions of NOx and may be subject to 50% 
reductions of VOC. Recips in West Texas are subject to up to 20% reductions 
of NOx and VOC. The reductions will be determined on a case-by case basis by 
the permit engineer reviewing the application. Although previously there was 
hope that no reductions would be required in West Texas, at the August 7 
meeting TNRCC indicated that they would require at least 1% reductions in 
West Texas. TNRCC has not decided how to deal with VOC reductions but one 
TNRCC staff member did mention he was aware that oxidation catalysts could 
reduce VOC emissions on engines.

In the August 7 meeting, TNRCC indicated that the reductions for recips will 
be calculated from a baseline of the average actual emissions in 1997-9. This 
was not the intent of the legislation and the legislators will be contacted 
by our industry organizations to attempt to change this. My thinking is that 
the reductions will likely be based on a ""before"" hourly grams/hp-hr rate 
from stack testing (or maybe AP-42) and an ""after"" hourly emissions rate 
based on stack testing. 

The reductions required from recips can be averaged across a pipeline, but 
reductions mandated by a regulation cannot be included. Reductions from a 
shutdown of an emission source can be included in the average, and it was 
suggested that reductions since 1997 could be included, but this has not been 
determined. It is highly unlikely that that TNRCC will allow reductions in 
East Texas to be averaged with reductions in West Texas.

Grandfathered emission sources other than recips are subject to 10-year old 
BACT. When discussing whether there would be any relief for smaller emission 
sources such as grandfathered valves or flanges, the TNRCC attorney indicated 
that there is no lower threshold and that all emissions sources must be 
authorized either by the existing authorizations or grandfather permits by 
the deadlines in  this legislation. See the notes above about the locations 
that TNRCC expects paperwork to be submitted for St. Ex.

The control/reduction deadlines for reducing emissions from all grandfathered 
emission sources is 3/1/07 in East Texas and 3/1/08 in West Texas. However 
TNRCC indicated that controls will likely be required prior to these dates. 
When you receive your permit for grandfathered sources, they anticipate that 
you will have 18 months to install controls. Since the applications are due 
on 9/1/03 and 9/1/04, and  TNRCC has one year to process applications (but it 
could be less), you should anticipate being required to install controls in 
2005-2007. The application fee may be $450.

The grandfather rule will be proposed on October 24, 2001 and should be 
finalized in March 2002.

Today, the FERC  issued an order rejecting NYISO's request to lift the 
$2.52/MW bid cap on its  non-synchronized reserve market and ordered that a 
technical conference be  convened to find solutions to the problems in the 
non-synchronized reserve  market and also the energy market and its design 
flaws (as requested by  EPMI).? The Commission rejected NYISO's request 
because of its failure to  implement changes in the non-synchronized reserve 
market ordered by the  Commission and because the changes that were made do 
not significantly reduce  concentration of that market east of the central 
east constraint, but said that  it would lift the caps once the market could 
be demonstrated to be workably  competitive.
?
Commissioner Hebert  disented, in favor of lifting the bid caps as well as 
the $1000 cap on the  energy market.? He continues to support modifications 
to NYISO's markets  that would allow other suppliers to participate.? Hebert 
feels that a  technical conference would be ineffectual.

agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition 
of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine 
trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for 
identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him 
so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest 
Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges 
will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will 
depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the 
trees which are flagged.

As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits 
and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged 
and I will contact Ken Jacobs so that he can make a site visit.",Ken Jacobs,,"the Forest Service the Forest

been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet.

A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V 
facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All 
Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year.

Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air 
permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an 
endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted 
and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a 
new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered 
Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian 
Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the 
EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern.

293,"John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and 
would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why  
Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air 
permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to 
ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information 
required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a 
September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that 
energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I 
phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept 
aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, 
both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we 
approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were 
conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional 
time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else 
could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure 
that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.",John Phil Transwestern  ,,Redrock EPA State

309,"Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.

As we discussed, Mark Haedicke and I discussed the possibility of providing 
Kevin McConville with some sort of indemnity in order to make sure that he 
remains available and cooperative during the pendency of the NSM case and 
other litigation matters.

We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin.  The 
terms of that Agreement would include:

1. He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel 
regarding litigation matters.  He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare 
for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as 
needed.

2. Through February 1, 2001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this 
cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to 
the terms of his employment agreement).  After Feb.1, 2001, he will be paid a 
rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard.

3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary 
course and scope of his employment with Enron, up to the last date of his 
employment with Enron.  Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or 
claims based upon the following:

  -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment, 
  -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA,
  -- Kevin's intentional acts, 
  -- Kevin's gross negligence,
  -- Kevin's reckless conduct,
  -- conduct that is in violation of any law, statute, regulation, or other 
legal obligation, or 
  -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act.

4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 
2/1/01.  The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt.  In addition, 
all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of  the 
agreement.

Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.  I 
am available to participate in your call with him, if you would like me to 
attend.

Paperloop has given us an estimate for the cost of giving us online access to their complete historical pricing database on an going basis. Essentially this would cover all products that are contained in any of the price tables in Pulp & Paper Week. 

Their quote is expensive so we need to think about it. We already have a fair amount of historical information, although many of their prices go back (monthly) to 1979 or 1980. And, of course, their data base includes some products we don't presently track. My question to you: Would this access make a significant difference to you in doing price analysis?

Avril: an alternate and very labor-intensive approach: I have almost all of the Pulp & Paper Weeks going back to 1979; we could ask a temp to key the data in out of the newsletters.

343,"The Commission's Energy Division held a workshop yesterday (May 21st) with
the stated objective of ""developing a viable program for real time pricing
options which will attract sufficient customer participation to have a
meaningful impact starting July 1, 2001.""

In short, the workshop provided the California Energy Commission (CEC) a
forum to push the proposal it advanced in the SCE/PG&E rate design
proceeding (which has now been fleshed out more through proposed tariff
language, attached).  The Energy Division is taking the view that the CEC
proposal is the ""point of departure.""  In other words, that's what's going
to be adopted unless changes are made in this workshop process. The UDCs are
taking the view that there is no way they can implement the CEC's proposal
by July 1.

The hang up, from the UDCs' end, appears to be the ""two part"" nature of the
proposal.  Basically, the CEC has proposed (based on the program currently
being used by Georgia Power) that a customer pays for baseline level of
usage at standard tariff prices and differences in usage from the baseline
are billed at RTP prices. The UDCs state that they could have their billing
systems ready in a month to bill customers at market prices for entire
consumption, but it would take four to six months to have the billing
systems ready to administer the two part proposal.  The CEC is insistent
that given the fact that the RTP program will be voluntary, the number of
customers that will be on the program initially will not be large and the
UDCs should, at minimum, be able to establish a manual system to bill these
customers.  The UDCs, in return, state that it makes no sense to waste the
time and effort to establish a manual system if you are working toward
greater participation --i.e., start working toward an automated system.  The
result of the discussions was that the UDCs, CEC and the Energy Division are
suppose to get together in a smaller working group to see what can be done
about the billing constraints so that something can be in place on July 1.
On possible solution discussed is the decoupling of the standard tariff
piece of the customer's bill from the real time piece for a few months until
the billing constraints are worked out.  I think the idea is that the
customer would be billed at the standard tariff price for all usage with a
true up later on for the real time pricing on the incremental portion  of
the usage.

Other points of interest arising from the workshop:

The CEC's proposal calls for ""RTP Values"" to be prepared by DWR and the ISO
for each of the 24 hours of the following day. These prices will be posted
on the ISO and DWR websites. DWR is concerned, however, about the market
having too much information about its procurement practices.  Therefore DWR
will use information readily obtainable in the market (e.g., Platts index
that publishes next day prices for on and off peak).  DWR, however, will
make certain adjustments to these published prices.  It was not clear
exactly what adjustments would be made.  There was concern from participants
at the workshop that the DWR price would not be transparent.

A lot of discussion ensued as to whether the $35 million authorized by AB
29X will be sufficient to pay for all the meters (the plan is to put an
interval meter in place for all customers over 200 kW).  SCE has taken the
position that the $1400 per meter which is being allocated is not
sufficient.  SCE will not start installing meters until it receives
clarification from the Commission that it will be allowed to track the costs
in  a memorandum account for potential future recovery (SCE plans to file an
advice letter on this point this week).  There is also concern about what
the $1400 buys you. Apparently the meters will have the capability to
provide a customers pricing data as frequently as they wants it, but if the
customer wants to access that data on a more frequent data than daily, it
will have to buy additional software (about $1000).

At the tail end of the day there was some discussion on how real time
pricing would interact with other rates and demand responsiveness programs.
An analysis was prepared by John Flory (private consultant working for the
CEC on this) which sets forth ""his best shot"" on how real time pricing can
supplement several other demand responsiveness options  to provide
additional demand cost reduction benefits. For example, a customer on both
the Scheduled Load Reduction Program and on RTP could, during his non-SLRP
hours respond to RTP prices.  Mr. Flory prepared a chart which highlights
which programs he believes could work together and which will not.  A copy
of this material will be faxed to Sue Mara (SF) and Harry Kingerski
(Houston).

The process from here on out is not clear.  The Energy Division will write
up a brief report on the workshop (without recommendations).  The small
working group referenced above will convene and furnish a report back by the
end of next week.  After that it gets kind of fuzzy as to how something will
be implemented by July 1.

If you have any additional questions about the workshop, please call.

         Thanks for your comments. I guess that explains why you're at
Enron rather than PG&E.    By the way, if you have not already met, I am
sure you would enjoy talking about energy markets with Professor Severin

","Susan J Mara
	",,
353,"Alan and Mary  --

Below are my comments and attached documents for the Conference on Market 
Monitoring in California at the FERC.  I will call later to discuss further.  
I suggest filing comments and would propose something along the lines of 
PJM's market monitoring program for Enron's Proposal.  Please forward to 
anyone else you think appropriate.

Comments and documents --

Attached are the four proposals discussed at the conference.  Comments are 
due February 6.  Staff intends to issue its report/recommendations to the 
Commission March 1.  We can comment on the Staff recommendations in March and 
Commission action is anticipated around May 1. 

Conference  --

Scott Miller chaired this informal Staff conference.   The morning was spent 
discussing principles and the afternoon on specific proposals.  This included 
the explanations of the attached plans, as well as a discussion of the PJM 
Market Monitoring Program. 

The conference can be summarized as follows --
 
 screens can be developed to determine if market power exists and is being 
exercised. 

 an appropriate role of the market monitor is to suggest structural reforms.

 Independence is necessary, but undefined.

 due process is necessary for any person under scrutiny.

 the debate on mitigation continues -- if mitigation, by whom and when are 
the hot topics.

 one key is to get the market structure right -- mitigation becomes 
unnecessary.

 California is different -- too much dependence on spot market/limited long 
term contracts; and insufficient demand response.
 
 
The good news is that --

 Staff does not consider the ISO proposal as a starting point, but as a 
vehicle to generate discussions
 (Staff succeeded  -- Duke and Dynegy went to great lengths to critize it).
 
 Staff has an open mind on the appropriate approach to market monitoring and 
are soliciting written proposals  and comparisons to existing programs.

 Staff is not trying to fix the structure of the California market here -- 
ISO should do so under the December 15  order.

 Regional scope and access to information are legitimate questions for 
comment.

 
",Alan Mary   Scott Miller Duke Dynegy,,"FERC PJM Enron the 
Commission March 1 ISO"
354,"Hi Laura:  I've attached three things, but first wanted to give you a bit of 
an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities 
Commission.  

Move to Prohibit Customer Choice
As you may know, AB1X, the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the 
Governor signed, gives the California Department of Water Resources the 
authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities.  Included in that bill, 
however, is a provision that prohibits ""Direct Access,""  California's term 
for customer choice.  

In sum, the bill, in its current form, prohibits businesses and consumers 
from chosing an alternative energy service provider, like Enron.  Our 
understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition.  
Their reasoning is that they need a ""captive"" customer base to pay for the 
bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWR's power purchases.

Customer choice was of course the foundation of California's restructuring 
law, AB 1890, and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally 
flawed plan.  For example, the only businesses and consumers that were 
protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those 
businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with 
competitive service providers.  Ironically, the recently passed legislation 
takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage 
their energy costs.  Before AB 1890, consumers and businesses had one 
choice--the monopoly  utility.  With the passage of AB 1X, they again will 
have one choice. But this time their only choice will be to buy from a 
government agency DWR.

A broad coalition of consumer groups has expressed its opposition to the 
prohibition and Senator Debra Bowen (a key player on the Senate side), and 
Fred Keeley (a key player on the Assembly side), have promised to ""fix"" the 
prohibition in another bill ""SB27X.""  I'll forward in another email the 
language that the coalition has drafted and hopes Bowen and Keeley will carry.

Unfortunately, we are now hearing rumors that the Governor intends to direct 
the California Public Utilities to immediately implement the provisions of 
AB1X prohibiting Direct Access, despite the fact that a large coalition of 
consumers and service providers are actively working with Bown and Keeley to 
amend the prohibition language.

It would be extremely useful if the folks participating in the meeting on 
Thursday with the Governor let him know that taking choices away from 
businesses and customers is the wrong way to go and that he and the 
legislative leaders need to work with the coalition to fix it.  You'll note 
in the language developed by the coalition that the proposal strikes a 
reasonable balance between the Dept of Finance's concerns about recouping 
DWR's costs of buying power, and the need to give consumers and businesses 
maximum flexible in managing their energy costs.

Move to Have the State Take Over the Electric Industry in California

John Burton, the Democratic leader of the Senate, insists that, ""if 
California is going to 'bail out' the utilities, the State needs to get 
something in return.""  Burton wants the state to buy and operate PG&E's and 
Edison's transmission system and create a state power authority that would 
get in the business of (among other things) developing, financing, 
constructing and operating power plants and natural gas pipelines.  Burton 
got both of these bills designed to take over the industry passd out of his 
committee yesterday (SB6X and SB33X).  It is unclear how much support he has 
in the full Senate or in the Assembly, but the possibility of passage is 
certainly greater than zero at this juncture.

Others experts are offering a better alternative.  When the federal 
government helped Chrysler out of its financial difficulties 20 years ago, 
the federal government received stock warrants in return.  Until recently, 
the Governor favored warrants, but more recently he has waivered in his 
statements regarding a state take over.  Burton appears to have negotiating 
leverage with the Governor and appears to be using it.

Again, it would be extremely useful for folks to let the Govenor know in the 
meetings on Thursday that a State take over of the industry is an extreme 
move and bad public policy.  I will forward to you in a separate email 
letters that we sent to Burton expressing our opposition to his bills and the 
reasons for our opposition.  In brief, there is no shortage of private 
capital ready and willing to invest in California's energy infrastructure 
(i.e., power plants, electric transmission lines, gas pipelines).  All 
California needs to do is create the investment climate necessary to attract 
the capital.  In addition, history shows that the State is extremely 
ill-equipped to become California's mega-utility. 

Here are the attachments:

A demand buy-down proposal.  We made this proposal to the Governor (and 
continue to propose it to policymakers in Sacramento, Washington D.C. and 
just about everywhere else).  In short, the notion is that, if the market is 
willing to pay power producers, say, 7 cents/kwh to ""produce"" power, then the 
market ought to be willing to pay businesses and consumers 7 cents/kwh to 
""reduce"" power consumption.  

This approach is critical for two reasons:  first, it provides businesses and 
consumers the financial incentives necessary (and that California currently 
lacks) to conserve energy and use energy more efficiently.  Second, because 
California delayed identifying and implementing a solution to California's 
energy crisis, its options for addressing the severe shortages that are 
likely occur this summer are very limited.  Reducing demand represents one of 
the few options that can help to immediately reduce the gap between supply 
and demand.  Putting financial incentives in place now to reduce demand and 
""free up"" electrons is an investment with significant payback.

A ""manifesto"" recently released by a group of Berkeley and Stanford 
economists and industry experts urging the Govenor to pursue a 
""market-oriented"" solution to California's energy crisis.

An editorial in yesterday's Wall Street Journal by Dan McFadden, a nobel 
prize-winning economist from Berkeley echoing the proposal advanced in the 
""manifesto.""  McFadden was one of the manifesto's signatories.

Finally, we are working on ""model Legislation"" proposing a market-based 
solution that we will share with you soon and that we hope the business 
community--and the Valley in particular--can embrace and advocate.

I realize that this is a lot of information and I apologize for the length of 
this note, but I wanted to try to make sure that you're up-to-date.  Please 
don't hesitate to give me a call if you'd like to discuss further.

Best,
Jeff

Exclusive Deal from Down Under 
Great Wines 
A Tale of two Australias 
Wine Team Picks: Julian Davies on Sainted Brothers Wines 


Our apologies to those who couldn't log on to wine.com yesterday. Our 
wine dog, Zach, tripped over the cord. We're back with this 
great deal. 


Exclusive Deal from Down Under

This week www.wine.com travels to the Southern Hemisphere, where 
some of the world's most attractive wines are now being made. As 
evidence, we're offering newsletter subscribers a special deal on a 
dynamite pair of reds from Tapestry, an Australian label that we 
represent exclusively in the United States. 

Before we tasted Tapestry's 1998 bottlings, we'd only heard rumors 
about this unusual vintage Down Under - a rare confluence of warm 
ripening conditions with a long growing season that conferred great 
depth of character. As soon as we sampled the Bin 338 Shiraz and Bin 
388 Cabernet Sauvignon, we realized the talk was true. Both wines are 
profoundly complex, but also deliriously enjoyable because of their 
rich, fat, berry fruit. They're classic examples of serious wines 
that are delicious now but will also improve for years to come. 

Eventually, Wine & Spirits magazine caught on, awarding the Cabernet 
94 points giving the Shiraz a 90. That made us feel rather cagey, 
since we'd already imported them and own their American rights. 
Australian wines of this caliber commonly command prices around $50, 
but we're able to offer these to you for less than half that. Just 
our way of saying, ""Good on ya.""

wines, visit our website: www.wine.com.

A Tale of Two Australias

Among wine enthusiasts, it's now a commonly held belief that the 
world's most exciting region is Australia. Why? A constellation of 
factors including old vines, new technology, and, not 
insignificantly, the famous Australian mindset, which is 
straightforward, unpretentious, and fun loving. 

""Australians aren't wine snobs,"" observes wine.com senior merchant 
Jeff Prather. ""They're down to earth. They have a European heritage, 
but they started their own culture, which didn't kowtow to tradition. 
American wine lovers have always seemed to think that they had to 
emulate Europe."" 

Vibrant wine culture
Interestingly in that light, Australia has the highest per-capita 
wine consumption in the English-speaking world. It covers about the 
same amount of surface area as the United States, but has only 6 
percent of the population. 

""Australians have huge amounts of arable land, but they don't have 
the population base to tend it,"" says wine.com merchant Bo Thompson. 
""As a result, they've had to learn to practice winemaking through 
technology."" From computerized 70,000-gallon tanks to state-of-the- 
art refrigeration to horizontal ""rotofermenters"" that punch down 
grapes automatically, Australia is the world's trendsetter in 
winemaking technology. 

In addition to enabling the industry to get its work done, this 
gadgetry has developed with an eye to serving the national palate. 
Its enthusiasms can be described in three words: fruit, fruit, 
and fruit. The trademark Australian wine style is big, ripe, and 
extracted, emphasizing the flavor -- and power -- of the grape 
above all. 

Advanced yet artisanal
Curiously, this is consistent with another important though seemingly 
opposite trend in the Aussie revolution: the renaissance of Old World 
artisanal winemaking, a decidedly low-tech approach that focuses on 
ancient vines, some dating to the 19th century. 

""[The Australian artisanal approach] has everything to do with what's 
going on in the vineyard,"" says Thompson. ""The recent generation has 
drastically improved its vineyard techniques through different types 
of trellising and experimentation with irrigation and dry farming. 
They're bringing back a lot of old vines that had been left to the 
wild - for example, d'Arenberg's Dead Arm Shiraz is made from vines 
that have been half-killed by disease -- divided right down the 
middle. But the fruit extraction they're getting is amazing."" 

""If you name the greatest wines in Australia,"" says Prather, you'd 
have to include d'Arenberg, Penfolds Grange, Clarendon Hills, 
Elderton, and Henschke Hill of Grace.... A lot of them are old-vine 
fanatics, and for that you have to pay a price -- those wines are 
expensive. But the other gift that Australia gives the world is 
oceans of really good wine that doesn't pretend to be great. Wineries 
like Rosemount, Penfolds, Punters Corner, and Yering Station produce 
gigantic amounts of bargain-priced wines with consistently terrific 
flavor. So what you've got, really, is a tale of two continents: a 
tiny amount of great artisanal wines and gigantic amounts of 
friendly, quaffable wines."" 

What they all have in common, Prather sums up, is that ""they're flat- 
out delicious. Australians have hit the sweet spot of the modern 
palate: wines with consistently ripe and juicy flavors due to their 
warm climate, but with really friendly textures that aren't overly 
tannic, astringent, or acidic. In the contemporary wine business, 
that is a sure-fire formula for success.""

Wine Team Picks: Julian Davies on Sainted Brothers Wines

It's widely known that yesterday, February 14, was St. Valentine's 
Day. But now that you're finished pandering to the candyman, can you 
name the saints who are honored today? 

I thought as much. February 15 is a day that commemorates St. 
Faustinus and St. Jovita. Born in northern Italy in the second 
century, this pair of brothers preached the word with such fervor 
that they enraged a heathen lord named Julian (no relation), who 
ordered them arrested and tortured. Ultimately Emperor Hadrian had 
them beheaded. 

A modern analogue of Faustinus and Jovita might be Ethan and Joel 
Coen, a pair of steadfast siblings who have maintained their filmic 
faith despite ceaseless heathen persecution -- the most recent result 
being their movie ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Hence, herewith, in 
observance of St. Faustinus and St. Jovita Day, five wines paired 
with five films from St. Ethan and St. Joel.

I guess you all have been wondering what is wrong and why I have been out of the office.  No Mr. Wong it's not Anthrax!

I have been ill for a while but not as bad as I am currently doing............I have had diabetes for the past six years and a heart that likes to act up every once in a while. These two sometimes don't mix well and currently my situation has gotten a little worse.  On Sunday I got really ill and my face and arm on the right side were really numb, which are signs of an early stroke.  It is not the first time that it has happened and I am taking medication to control my current situation.  I am also waiting on results from the doctor on my kidneys diagnosis.  
People with diabetes have extra reason to be mindful of heart and blood vessel disease. Diabetes carries an increased risk for heart attack, stroke, and complications related to poor circulation. 
I just want to make you all aware of what is going on with me and to let you know that I am taking my medication and will try to do a better job in taking care of myself.

electricity, House Democrats from California urged FERC to support Gov. Gray
Davis' refund demands. Dale Kasler in the Sacramento Bee
<http://www.capitolalert.com/news/capalert06_20010713.html> -- 7/13/01
Governor hopes 'New FERC' will order refunds -- California Governor Gray
Davis Thursday said he hoped the newly-reconsituted Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission would order $8.9 billion in refunds for the state for
electricity overcharges, despite a FERC judge's report to the commission
that the refund amount was too high. ""I would like to believe the
commission, with two new commissioners, will be more sensitive to California
consumers and order all the refunds that are due,"" Davis said in a
statement. Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires

Lawmakers tell FERC to act on power refunds -- The U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission should act on California's demand for refunds on
electricity sales without convening a 60-day evidentiary proceeding as
called for by the commission's chief administrative law judge. That's the
message 31 House Democrats from California sent in a letter Thursday to the
five-member regulatory panel. Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires

Customers get a payback for conservation -- Nearly a third of Pacific Gas &
Electric customers who have received this month's bill got rebates totaling
$7.6 million as a reward for slashing electricity use in June, the utility
said yesterday. The program that cuts 20 percent off ratepayers' bills if
they reduce usage by 20 percent was a high-profile initiative by Gov. Gray
Davis to promote conservation and decrease dependence on out-of-state
generators. Joe Garofoli in the San Francisco Chronicle

Enron profits -- Energy trader Enron Corp. said Thursday that second-quarter
profit rose 40% as its sales of natural gas and electricity surged in
California and elsewhere. Net income rose to $404 million, or 45 cents a
share, from $289 million, or 34 cents, in the year-earlier period. The story

Records suggest Duke was low-price supplier -- Internal documents give a
broader view of power pricing in California's energy crisis and show that
Duke Energy was one of the state's lowest-priced providers. An analysis by
The Charlotte Observer shows the state paid an average of $269 per
megawatt-hour for $3.5 billion of power during the first quarter, according
to documents from the state's Department of Water Resources. Duke was the
fourth-largest supplier to the agency, which buys about one-third of the
state's power. Stella Hopkins in the Orange County Register
<http://www.ocregister.com/news/duke00713cci.shtml> -- 7/13/01
7 California advisers own energy stocks -- At least seven consultants hired
by Gov. Gray Davis to help California buy and deliver power own stock in
power companies doing business with the state, according to financial
statements released yesterday. The personal financial statements prompted
Secretary of State Bill Jones, an announced GOP candidate for governor, to
call for an investigation into a conflict of interest that Jones said could
compromise California's position as an electricity buyer. Mark Martin in the
San Francisco Chronicle

Calpine proposes power plant for Alviso -- Alviso, the long-neglected North
San Jose neighborhood abutting five landfills and a sewage treatment plant,
may become the site of two major power plants as well. Calpine has proposed
a 260-megawatt plant to power what would be the world's largest Internet
server farm. This may be good news to the people of Alviso, since the plant
would emit less smog than 89 diesel generators that would have been used
otherwise. Mike Zapler in the San Jose Mercury
<http://www0.mercurycenter.com/premium/local/docs/alviso13.htm> -- 7/13/01
Power plant clears hurdle -- Despite a momentary snag, legislation clearing
the way for repairing and restarting the old Pacific Gas & Electric Corp.
power plant on Coffee Road passed the state Senate unanimously Thursday. It
now goes back to the Assembly for what is expected to be routine endorsement
of Senate amendments, and then moves to Gov. Gray Davis' desk for his
signature. Vic Pollard in the Bakersfield Californian --

Davis and energy and polls -- California Governor Gray Davis's popularity is
bouncing back, and pollsters credit the Democratic lawmaker's campaign to
blame the state's energy problems on out-of-state power companies. Davis has
criticized Duke Energy Corp., Enron Corp. and other power sellers as price
gougers since January. This week, Davis used a power-plant opening as a
platform to claim that energy sellers are ``bleeding us dry.'' The
Democratic state attorney general and Democratic-controlled state Senate are
investigating the firms for market manipulation. David Ward and Daniel Taub

Cal-Fed funding approved -- Senate committee Thursday approved $135 million
for California water projects next year, including about $40 million in
projects related to the joint state-federal partnership called Cal-Fed and
$22.5 million for Sacramento area flood-control work. The spending measure
for energy and water projects cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee.
After its approval by the full Senate, the House and Senate will sit down to

Senate holds fast on Klamath plan -- The Senate defeated an effort Thursday
to turn back the clock on the Endangered Species Act and release water to
parched Klamath basin farmers in Northern California and southern Oregon.
The 52-48 vote killed an amendment to a 2002 Interior Department spending
bill that would have effectively scuttled a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
directive that turned off the flow of irrigation waters in the
drought-plagued basin in April in order to protect endangered salmon and
suckerfish. David Whitney in the Sacramento Bee

Smog -- Smog in the United States increased dramatically through the first
half of the year, jumping 25 percent above the same period last year, a
Mercury News analysis of state air-quality records has found. But while
California and the nation were doing worse overall, the Bay Area improved
slightly, with the number of smog violations falling from two to one. Seth

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  limit.

373,"Thanks for the information.  It is good to know we have a potential ally.

I'm not sure when the MA AG weighed in on the Verizon petition.  If it was a 
last minute effort at the FCC it is likely to be less effective that if they 
were active in the proceeding when the state was making its determination.  
The point here is that the timing of the AG's participation is bound to be as 
important as the issues they raise.

Obviously, before we would engage in soliciting AG intervention, we would 
have to have a very clear strategy about how much pressure we want to exert 
in 271 applications, directly or indirectly, in exchange for cooperation on 
other fronts (access to high capacity loops, for example).  This is 
especially true in light of our discussion around our primary wholesale 
trading partners on today's weekly call.

ROMANIA: Enron exits gas marketing deal with Romania's SNP.

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BUCHAREST, April 19 (Reuters) - Enron Capital BV, a unit of U.S. energy group 
Enron Corp has given up a marketing deal with Romania's state oil company SNP 
Petrom by assigning its stake in a gas joint venture to SNP, officials said 
on Thursday. 
""Enron agreed to freely transfer to its 50 percent stake to the SNP,"" SNP's 
Gabriel Nastase said. ""They left the venture after failure to handle (for 
SNP) gas imports as planned.""
Petrom-Enron Gas SRL, was created in 1998 as a 10-year joint venture, with 
the two firms each owning 50 percent. 
Nastase said Enron had complained that it could not access Romania's national 
gas transport pipelines to handle the planned imports. He said the SNP was 
currently seeking a new partner to replace Enron in the venture but gave no 
other details. 
Enron officials were not immediately available for comment. 
SNP plans to extract 6.28 billion cubic metres of gas this year, slightly up 
from 6.17 billion in 2000.

Blockbuster Swings to 1st-Quarter Profit Amid Solid Revenue Growth

04/19/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DALLAS -- Blockbuster Inc. swung to a first-quarter profit amid solid revenue 
growth, while cash earnings easily exceeded Wall Street expectations. 
The video-rental company Thursday posted net income of $4.7 million, or three 
cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.1 million, or two 
cents a share. Revenue rose 8.3% to $1.31 billion from $1.21 billion.
Blockbuster (BBI), a unit of Viacom Inc., posted cash earnings, which 
excludes amortization-related costs, of $46.5 million, or 27 cents a share, 
compared with $38.1 million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts 
expected earnings of 24 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First 
Call. 
Viacom (VIA, VIAB) has given up on its plans to split off Blockbuster now 
that the video-rental giant's business has turned around so well in the past 
few years. For more than a year, Viacom had said it was waiting for a 
recovery in Blockbuster's stock -- long stalled below its offering price -- 
before it went ahead with previously announced plans to split off the 
remaining 82.3% of the publicly traded unit. 
During the quarter, operating expenses increased to $725.4 million from $670 
million a year earlier. The company attributed the rise to the growth in the 
number of stores and investments. 
Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or 
Ebitda, rose 6.8% to $160.5 million. Free cash flow, or income before 
depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures, soared 67% to $99.9 
million. 
Looking forward, Blockbuster expects second-quarter revenue to remain flat 
with year-earlier results because of strong movie titles during that period. 
Analysts surveyed by First Call expect earnings of 10 cents a share. In the 
year-earlier period, the company reported a loss of $27.9 million, or 16 
cents a share, on revenue of $1.21 billion. 
For 2001, Blockbuster expects world-wide same-store revenue to grow in the 
low single digit range, while capital expenditures are expected to reach 
about $150 million to $175 million. 
Blockbuster also expects to generate ""solid"" cash-earnings growth for the 
year. It also plans to add about 200 to 250 company-operated stores, most of 
which will be in the U.S. 
Analysts expect the company to earn about 76 cents a share, according to 
First Call. In 2000, the company posted a loss of $75.9 million, or 43 cents 
a share, on revenue of $4.96 billion. Those results include a noncash charge 
in the new-media segment of about $19 million, or 11 cents a share, related 
to the impairment of hardware and software. 
In March, Blockbuster ended its exclusive services agreement with Enron 
Corp.'s Broadband Services unit, less than eight months after signing the 
20-year pact. The agreement called for tens of millions of homes in the U.S. 
and Europe to be able to receive movies on demand from Blockbuster via Enron
's (ENE) high-speed telephone lines. Both companies now say they will pursue 
video-on-demand services on their own or with other partners.

INDIA: UPDATE 1-Enron India unit lenders to meet on April 23.

04/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, April 19 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's Indian unit has 
called a meeting of its lenders on April 23 to discuss the ongoing payment 
row with India's Maharashtra state government, a company spokesman said on 
Thursday. 
The meeting will be in London and will be attended by international as well 
as local lenders of the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), he added.
Creditors have extended $1.2 billion in loans to finance construction of a 
second phase of the plant, which is expected to begin operating later this 
year, tripling the plant's power output. 
The move comes amid escalating tensions between Enron and Maharashtra over 
the inability of the state's utility to pay its monthly bills. 
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has been defaulting on 
payments since October for electricity purchased from Dabhol's 740 MW power 
plant on the state's west coast. The amount outstanding totals 2.26 billion 
rupees ($48.24 million). 
In an effort to compel payment, Dabhol has twice invoked a federal government 
guarantee to cover payment defaults by the state utility. 
Last week, Dabhol also issued a notice of political force majeure to 
Maharashtra. Force majeure is an event beyond the control of a contractual 
party that could not have been prevented. 
The dispute has caused Enron to freeze most of its investment plans in India 
and has also affected foreign investment in India's power sector. 
""This meeting has been called to update the lenders about the situation,"" the 
DPC spokesman said. 
The Indian lenders likely to attend are the Industrial Development Bank of 
India , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank, State Bank of 
India and ICICI . 
The Business Standard newspaper reported that Maharashtra no longer intends 
to buy power produced by the second phase of the Dabhol project, which is 
nearing completion. The $1.86 billion addition will nearly triple the plant's 
output capacity to 2,184 MW. 
""As far as Maharashtra is concerned, phase two is as good as scrapped,"" the 
financial daily quoted the state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh as telling 
reporters in Bombay on Wednesday. 
The state government signed a contract in the mid-1990's to buy the plant's 
entire power output. But a rise in the cost of naphtha, the fuel currently 
used to power the plant, and a decline in the value of the Indian rupee 
against the dollar, has inflated the cost of the power produced by the Dabhol 
plant beyond the price expected at the time the contract. 
That has made the power produced by the Enron plant twice the cost of power 
produced by other suppliers in the state, fuelling popular and political 
pressure to scrap the contract. ($1=46.84 Indian rupees).

Enron Ends Gas Import, Marketing Venture With Romania's Petrom

     Bucharest, April 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. withdrew from a
venture with Romania's national oil company, SNP Petrom SA, after
failing to gain access to the gas import pipeline, Petrom said.
     Enron Europe, a unit of the world's largest energy trader, set
up Petrom-Enron Gas SRL three years ago to import natural gas to
Romania and market Petrom's gas at home and abroad.
     ``Enron withdrew from the joint venture because they said they
couldn't get access to Romania's natural gas import transportation
system,'' Petrom spokesman Gabriel Nastase said in an interview.
     State-owned Transgaz, which operates the nation's natural gas
pipeline, was not available for comment.
     Romania currently imports natural gas from Russia's OAO Gazprom
through Wintershall AG, the oil and gas unit of BASF AG.
     Last year, Transgaz stopped gas imports from Ukraine, at that
time Romania's other foreign supplier, after Gazprom charged that
Ukraine was stealing gas from its pipeline that transits that
country with the purpose of re-exporting it.
     Petrom, which produces more than 6 billion cubic meters of gas
per year, accounting for as much as 42 percent of Romania's domestic
gas production, will seek another domestic or foreign partner to
market its gas, Nastase said.
     Enron will remain in Romania, said Bogdan Diaconu, Enron's
representative. He would not detail reasons for withdrawing from the
venture.

		Davis' gouging claims disputed 
Officials say no link between PG&E bankruptcy, high prices

David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer 
		?
		Thursday, April 19, 2001 
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		Officials on the front lines of California's energy mess yesterday challenged 
Gov. Gray Davis' assertion that the state is being gouged by power companies 
because of PG&E's bankruptcy filing. 
		Such dissent from the governor's own subordinates could make it harder for 
Davis to gain support for his energy measures in the state Legislature. 
		Despite Davis' latest claims, the Department of Water Resources, which is 
spending about $70 million a day buying power, said there is no evidence 
linking recent price increases to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. filing for 
bankruptcy protection on April 6. 
		""It is a seller's market,"" said Viju Patel, executive manager of the 
Department of Water Resources' power systems department. ""The power companies 
do not need an excuse to raise prices."" 
		Critics say Davis' penchant for secrecy on energy issues has come back to 
haunt him at a time when he needs all the allies he can find. 
		""People aren't taking his words at face value,"" said Michael Shames, 
executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. 
		Republican lawmakers -- and even some Democrats -- have challenged a number 
of the governor's initiatives, including a multibillion-dollar bailout scheme 
for Southern California Edison. 
		Nevertheless, Davis reiterated his belief yesterday that recent electricity 
price increases are ""an aberration driven by the bankruptcy of PG&E."" 
		He said California's spending on power jumped 40 percent in the week 
following PG&E's bankruptcy filing because generators say they face a greater 
risk of not being paid. 
		""Nothing else in the equation has changed,"" said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman 
for the governor. ""Everything is the same except the bankruptcy."" 
		However, power companies were quick to challenge this assertion. They 
insisted that PG&E's bankruptcy actually was seen as a positive development 
by those in the energy business. 
		""If anything, PG&E provides some solace for traders because the bankruptcy 
provides an organized mechanism for recovery of payments,"" said Gary 
Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park 
energy- industry association. 
		On the other hand, he acknowledged that power companies are becoming 
increasingly wary of the state of California's creditworthiness as an energy 
buyer. 
		The Department of Water Resources already has spent nearly $5 billion buying 
electricity and has yet to recoup a dime from ratepayers. State regulators 
are still trying to come up with a way to apportion the limited revenues from 
power rates among the various parties in California's energy picture. 
		Rating agency Fitch Inc. said yesterday it may cut the state's credit rating 
because of questions surrounding recovery of energy costs. 
		""People are keeping an eye on things,"" Ackerman said. ""They're watching how 
California finances things."" 
		If a premium on electricity sales to the state exists, he said it probably 
has been in place since the beginning of the year, well before PG&E's current 
woes. 
		UCAN's Shames agreed. He said power companies added a ""risk premium"" to their 
California power sales late last year when it looked like the state's energy 
troubles were worsening. 
		""PG&E's bankruptcy may have increased the uncertainty,"" Shames said, ""but 
we've been paying a risk premium for months now."" 
		Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, insisted that 
his company's traders are not using questions about PG&E's or California's 
financial solvency as a fresh excuse for higher prices. 
		""I haven't seen any evidence of it,"" he said. 
		Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston's Enron Corp., laid blame for recent 
price increases on low rainfall throughout the West, which has cut output at 
hydroelectric facilities, as well as on California's chronic power shortage. 
		""It's not that there's a premium on prices,"" he said. ""It's just supply and 
demand."" 
		That said, Palmer acknowledged that California's firm insistance on blackouts 
being avoided at all costs leaves the state vulnerable to virtually any price 
generators choose to demand. 
		""This means prices will be used to allocate a scarce resource,"" he said. 
""There's no other way it could work."" 
		Bottom line for consumers: It's going to be a long, hot summer, and 
electricity prices will soar even higher as demand surges. 
		And despite the best efforts of state officials, a daily threat of blackouts 
remains a virtual certainty as California's beleaguered power grid is 
stretched to the breaking point. 
		At the Department of Water Resources' command center in a Sacramento shopping 
mall, the state's team of electricity traders has moved onto a new, high-tech 
trading floor, where they negotiate power deals each day from the crack of 
dawn. 
		The department's Patel said daily blackouts may be averted this summer after 
consumers see skyrocketing power prices reflected in their bills. 
		""People will respond to these prices and they are going to conserve like 
never before,"" Patel predicted.

400,"Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms 


(Published April 4, 2001) 
There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that 
envelops California's energy crisis. 
Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control 
and the die is more or less cast. Whatever fate decrees - massive summer 
blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's 
utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov. Gray Davis downward are 
scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals 
for blame. 
No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very 
apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with 
energy and moved to other matters. Legislative committees are working on the 
hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special 
committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis 
have gone into semihibernation. 
Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears 
that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will 
backfire. ""Just remember Jimmy Carter,"" state Controller Kathleen Connell 
warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have ""no excuses"" for 
perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly. ""We will be 
accountable on Election Day 2002,"" she said. 
Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a 
second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined 
sharply in recent weeks. He devoted much of the weekend to defending his 
actions, saying, ""I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this 
problem,"" and trying to pin blame on Republicans. 
Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape 
from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses 
in the last three elections. The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder, 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of 
mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill 
Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis 
Davis. 
The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every 
sign of worsening. Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled 
""Meeting the Energy Challenge"" to defend the governor's actions, it's 
apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit. 
The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power 
purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into 
a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves. The 
long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases 
have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for 
them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float. 
Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase 
market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a 
deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit. 
Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the 
state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall 
Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power 
generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission 
grid have stalled, perhaps permanently. 
The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the 
specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air 
conditioners or medical equipment shut down. And the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis. 
Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy. With 
Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to 
protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

402,"Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power 
to the state, a U.S. court rules.
By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton
BEE STAFF WRITERS
(Published April 6, 2001) 
In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a 
federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order 
that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state 
without guarantee of payment. 
State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but 
could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant 
off-line for maintenance. 
On March 21, citing ""rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California 
landscape,"" U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction 
against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators. 
Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20 
percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found 
that loss of that production ""poses an imminent threat."" 
But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown ""a high 
likelihood of success on the merits"" of its appeal. 
While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the 
question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel 
directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in 
July. 
The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least 
temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which 
maintains and controls power transmissions. 
It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any 
of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers. 
""It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change 
anything over the weekend,"" said Detmers. ""But if Reliant decided on a 
unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely 
could have a system emergency."" 
Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but 
declined to specify their next move. 
""Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California,"" said company 
lobbyist Marty Wilson, and ""is still of a mind to want to cooperate."" 
Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District 
Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co., 
alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and 
production of electricity. 
The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of 
interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales 
into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order, 
and that goes directly to an appellate court. 
The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two 
other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though 
the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly 
in debt. 
Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay 
their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to 
the utilities. 
The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston 
and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & 
Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue 
supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to 
sell to companies that are not creditworthy. 
But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can 
rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice. 
""My hope is this is a temporary setback,"" said Robinson. He added, however, 
that the practical effect is ""at least for now, we don't have a tool to 
compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do"" -- respond to 
emergency demands for power. 
Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no 
jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators 
and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must 
settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs. 
In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special 
expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO. 
""Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court 
agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper,"" he 
said. ""But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short 
supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at 
risk."" 
Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for 
the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend 
the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its 
view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has 
jurisdiction. 
Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday. 
In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for 
energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big 
utilities and sell its power on the open market. 
Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants 
that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in 
Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell 
its power to PG&E. 
The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative 
energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell 
their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state. ","Denny Walsh Carrie Peyton

leadership from FERC.
They will strongly support the end of the buy-sell requirement and express 
concern about the CPUC's micromanagement of utility purchases--I told him 
we'd have a similar message on that issue.
FERC should ""PJM"" the California market--I told him we would differ 
significantly on that issue, i.e., PJM-ing generaly, and ""merging"" the PX and 
the ISO.
He said his comments on ""refunds"" would be ""narrow"" and would point out that 
the FERC staff report says there is evidence of specific ""bad actors"" and 
that those bad actors should be required to give refunds--I told him that our 
position hasn't changed on retroactive ratemaking.
I explained our position on getting more information to the market sooner.

So ... we set out to fix that. 
We spent a significant amount of time looking at individual salaries benchmarked against the survey results of positions with similar responsibilities and experience levels.  Existing internal equity issues were also considered.
Early next week, we will contact everyone to discuss where your current salary falls in our new ranges. If your salary is going to be adjusted, we will communicate your new salary at that meeting. We will also give you your new Enron Wholesale Services - Financial Operations shirt ( yes.. we have changed our name back to Financial Operations).

 Longhorns Zap Aggies (New Mexico Brand);
Freshmen Show Up Raring and Ready to Play

The Longhorns opened the 2001 season Saturday night before a sellout crowd in
Austin with an easy 41-7 victory over New Mexico State that gave positive
answers to most team question marks.
Two super freshmen and a freshman walk-on kicker even gave some hope for
those tough games down the line.
The kicker, Dusty Mangum of Mesquite, kicked two field goals and and five
extra points flawlessly. That might not sound like a big deal, particularly
since the field goals were short ones.
But if you had watched the place kickers in the spring, you would be ecstatic
that young Mangum seemed to be close to dead center on all seven of his first
collegiate kicks.
The other two freshmen are much more heralded, and rightly so, judging by
what they did Saturday night.
LB Derrick Johnson came in a a backup, but he had six tackles and caught
caught slippery RB Walter Taylor for a three-yard loss on a screeen pass that
appeared to be well executed until he sped past the blockers and nailed
Taylor.
Taylor hit the Longhorns for 113 yards rushing on just 13 carries with his
stop-and-go style, and he had only two plays that lost yardage all night.
That was one of them.
While Johnson is a heralded recruit, fellow freshman RB Cedric Benson is even
more highly touted after leading Midland Lee to three straight state titles,
and he gave a glimpse of his tremendous talent in a mop-up role Saturday.
He didn't get into the game until the fourth quarter, and then he did most of
his running behind the second-team defensive line.
But, with all due respect to Victor Ike and Ivan Williams, the top two
tailbacks, Benson showed talents that most running backs can only dream about
For starters, he has acceleration that is off the chart when he takes a
handoff. He also has great vision and knows instinctively where to run. He
also has an ability to make most tacklers miss without appearing to do
anything to make them miss. That means he doesn't have to slow down to do it.
He and Williams tied for top rushing honors with indentical stats - 15
carries for 64 yards and a touchdown.
Coach Mack Brown pointed out that it was easier sledding for Benson than for
Ike and Williams because he entered the game in the fourth quarter after the
Aggie defenders were tired.
But Ike and Williams did all their running behind the first-team line. The
offensive line is not a great run-blocking unit, so it figures that the
backups are even less adept at run blocking.
My nominees for the biggest positive surprises on offense and defense are
easy ones. WR Montrell Flowers and LB Tyrone Jones are seniors who have had
solid, but not spectacular careers.
Flowers caught two touchdown passes Saturday night and Jones had six tackles,
including two for losses.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:

First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred, so New Mexico State took the ball. That
turned out to be a great decision for the Horns because New Mexico State
fumbled the opening kickoff and the Longhorns had a 14-0 lead before either
team ran a play on the Texas end of the field. Tony Jeffery and Rod Babers
blocked a punt and Phillip Geiggar covered it in the end zone for the first
Texas touchdown and Mangum kicked his first extra point in college to give
Texas a 7-0 lead with 11:58 left. The Horns drove 50 yards on their second
possession to take a 14-0 lead when Williams scored on a 4-yard run and
Mangum kicked the extra point with 5:40 left in the period. Neither team had
much offense in the quarter - Texas had 30 yards on 16 plays and NM State had
26 on 14 plays - but two Aggie fumbles - the only turnovers in the game -
gave the Longhorns the two touchdown lead.

Second Quarter
Nathan Vasher's 16-yard punt return to the Aggies' 38 set up a field goal
drive. Ike got 15 yards on two strong runs, but then the drive stalled and
Mangum kicked his first college field goal, a 24-yarder, to give Texas a 17-0
lead with 7:24 left. The Horns scored another TD on their next possession,
going 80 yards in 11 plays. Flowers had a 23-yard catch and then a 9-yarder
for the TD. Mangum kicked the point for a 24-0 lead with 38 seconds left in
the half. Texas had 66 offensive yards in the quarter, while the Longhorn
defense was holding NM State to 3 net yards.

Third Quarter
Both teams got their offenses cranked up to start the third quarter. Texas
had a 79-yard drive to set up a 17-yard Mangum field goal to start the half,
but then Aggie TB Taylor's 43-yard run took the visitors deep into Longhorn
territory for the first time in the game. The drive reached the UT 14 before
stalling, and the field goal try was wide. After a Texas punt, NM State drove
85 yards in 9 plays to score and cut the UT lead to 27-7 with 1:02 left.

Fourth Quarter
Benson came in to start the fourth quarter and carried seven straight times
for 45 yards. Simms hit Flowers for 10 yards and the touchdown to cap the
drive. Mangum's kick gave UT a 34-7 lead with 9:28 left. The defense got a
quick stop and Major Applewhite relieved Simms at QB. With Applewhite hitting
four of five passes for 46 yards, including a 17-yard completion to Benson,
the Horns moved to the three and Benson ran over right tackle for his first
collegiate touchdown. Mangum's kick gave UT a 41-7 lead with 28 seconds left.

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns still have 12 commitments, but they have a good chance to pick
up another one this weekend.
The North Carolina game has been dedicated to the memory of former Longhorn
defense tackle Cole Pittman, who was killed in a tragic automobile accident
while returning to spring football practice at UT last February.
Pittman's younger brother, Chase, is an outstanding defensive end at
Shreveport Evangel and is one of the nation's top 100 players.
He took an official visit to LSU last weekend and will be at Texas this
weekend with his parents to participate in the events surrounding the game's
dedication to his brother.
LSU and Texas are the only schools he is still considering. He also took an
official visit to Oklahoma, but has eliminated the Sooners from
consideration. Look for a decision next week.
Evangel, one of the nation's top football powers, played Longview in
Shreveport last weekend and took a 27-7 victory on a muddy field.
Longview ran away from Pittman's side of the line all night, but he still had
eight tackles, including two sacks and two others for losses.
LB Marvin Byrdsong of Longview, was another national top 100 player in that
game.
He says he plans to come to the Texas-North Carolina game Saturday. ""I like
Texas and will definitely take an official visit to Texas later,"" he said.
* * * *
DT Marco Martin of Mesquite has a qualifying ACT  score and just needs to
make good grades this year to be qualified in core courses, too.
He has made a lot of progress in the classroom after missing part of last
season because of academic deficiencies.
Martin, a 6-4, 315-pounder with incredible speed and quickness, is on all the
national top 100 lists. He lists the Longhorns No. 1.
* * * *
Top recruits who attended the Longhorns' opener were LB Garnett Smith of
Arlington Lamar,  RB Paul Mosley of Austin Anderson and six players who are
committed to UT - LBs Brian Robison of Splendora and Marcus Myers of
Pflugerville Connally, DL Tully Janszen of Keller, RB/Athlete Clint Haney of
Smithson Valley, WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood and OL Brett Valdez
of Brownwood.
Haney scored on runs of 34 and 3 yards and had 99 yards rushing Friday in
Smithson Valley's 27-7 victory over Killeen Ellison. That game was called at
the half because of heavy thunderstorms.
Miksch caught three passes for 45 yards and had a 10-yard run in Westwood's
9-0 loss to Killeen Friday.
Smith said he really enjoyed the game Saturday night and loves the way the UT
linebackers blitz.
""I've seen them play on television,"" he said, ""but being there and seeing it
in person was a great experience. I love the way the bring linebackers on
nearly every play and the way the disquise who they are going to bring.
That's the kind of defense I'm looking for.""

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown worries about openers, so he was particularly happy about
the Longhorns' 41-7 romp past New Mexico State Saturday night.
""We had two areas we really wanted to concentrate on,"" he said. ""Defensively,
we wanted to hit people and force turnovers. Offensively, we wanted to be
physical.""
He said the team graded high in both areas.
""We forced three turnovers on defense,"" he said, ""and we hit people and flew
around and made plays most of the time. We had some lapses, and we need to
work on correcting that.""
He said he was pleased that the offense did not turn the ball over and was
able to overpower New Mexico State's defenders and run the ball despite a
stacked defense.
""Except for six plays, I though the offense played really, really well,"" he
said.
Those six plays included three to start the game, when a fumbled kickoff set
Texas up at the Aggies' 23 and the Horns lost 12 yards in three plays and had
to punt.
The other three were on the Longhorns' drive to open the second half. They
got a first-and-goal at the 1 and wound up kicking a field goal.
Brown said the Longhorns gave up on the run in the first two games last year
because of stacked defenses, ""and then we couldn't run it when we needed to
at Stanford and we got beat.""
""I told the staff before this game that I didn't care if they had 14 on the
line of scrimmage, we were going to run the ball,"" he said.
""We only ran three plays,"" Brown said, ""but we ran them a whole bunch. We
just wanted to line up and be physical.""
The Longhorns ran 45 times for 171 net yards and passed 38 times for 228
yards, and Brown said that is the kind of production he wanted.
He said there were some plays where the quarterback normally would have
audibled and called a pass, ""but we wanted to force the run and that's

Coach's Corner . . (continued from page 1)
what we did. We have to be able to run the ball when we want to, regardless
of the defensive alignment.""
Brown said DT Maurice Gordon played an outstanding game in his first start
after moving from a backup DE spot.
""Maurice is an outstanding pass rusher,"" he said. ""We already knew that, but
he also stood up well against the run. He runs a 4.5 and he's a defensive end
playing defensive tackle. His speed really helps us in there.""
After the game Saturday night, Brown said he felt it was the Longhorns best
opening game in his four years at Texas.
Monday, he said, ""After reviewing the film, this definitely was our best
opener at Texas. I was concerned about the kicking game and turnovers. You
always worry about that in openers, and our kicking game was really good and
we didn't turn the ball over.""
Brown said WR Kyle Shanahan has been cleared to practice this week, but he
said LB Lee Jackson's turf toe is still bothering him.

Ross Leaves, Plans to Return

Freshman CB Aaron Ross has left the team to clear up some NCAA Clearinghouse
issues.
""I have some Clearinghouse issues I need to get resolved in order to rejoin
the team,"" Ross said. ""I'm  going to get those issues worked out so I can
return to Texas in January.""
LB Aurmon Satchell had similar issues last year and he is back on the team
now and is a second-team linebacker. Look for Ross to be able to clear up the
problems and come back in time to go through spring practice next season.","Jerry Scarbrough's Austin Dusty Mangum Mangum LB Derrick Johnson Walter Taylor Taylor Johnson Midland Lee Victor Ike Ivan Williams Benson Williams Mack Brown Ike Jones Tony Jeffery Rod Babers Phillip Geiggar Nathan Vasher's Simms Applewhite QB Cole Pittman Pittman Chase Longview LB Marvin Byrdsong DT Marco Martin LB Garnett Smith Arlington Lamar RB Paul Mosley Austin Anderson Brian Robison Marcus Myers Clint Haney Dustin Miksch Brett Valdez

495,"Tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11.0M) has been amortized 
for the last several years and expensed to the Industrial groups (McConville 
and Ondarza).  As you are aware, I sued them for breach.  The settlement 
involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and 
Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.  It is my understanding 
that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland 
shop.   The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the 
lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.  It seemed logical 
to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as 
a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent

are well known and documented controls and process issues in the mid, back 
and risk offices of the company.  We are working quickly to rectify  - 
servicing your needs at the same time would slow us down.  On the European 
side, I would like your perspective on their controls and business.

dear c & j~~~~the following FYI is based on hours of research i did out of the goodness and generosity of my [IMAGE] in preparation of our "" Griswalds do NY Christmas 2001.""  of course you can thank me later but for now here are some suggestions :
              date:    dec. 22-dec.27
      Having reviewed several (and i do mean several) hotels the Park Lane seems to be the most reasonable. (yes, we are looking at the economics of this adventure[IMAGE]) (rooms vs. suites)  this would mean reserving 5 rooms (car and jim; jan and bob; hol and tan; jim and cor; jo-jo).  room rates:  standard:  park view $251.00  city view $  205.00         play suggestions (based on seeing 3 plays; one on broadway; one off broadway and the radio city music hall christmas show)   on:   the producers   or   aida;    off:  blueman troop;  and radio city xmas show.  
          on broad: $230   off:  150   radio c m  $150
             after reviewing, please adivse either by phone or mail as to the next step.  i suggest we reserve our room accommodations, theatre tickets, plane reservations etc. ASAP[IMAGE]     keep in mind that what you have just reviewed is open
to discussion and any and all suggestions you elves might have.   upon finalizing our plans i will provide trip agendas for all good little boys and girls~~~~sorry jim, i guess you'll have to look on with carrin[IMAGE]             x0x0x0x0x0[IMAGE] jdg

Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.",,,Enron Federal Credit Union Enron the Credit Union Credit Union Enron Corp.

533,"The note ""need to verify"" appears on this slide, after the bullet ""110,000 MMcfd annual average increase"".

I calculated this average annual amount from the first bullet ""CA's natural gas use will increase from 6,400 MMcfd in 2000 to 7,500 MMcfd in 2010"".  The first bullet and the third bullet are from the same source as the graph, The California Energy Commission.  Specifically, it's from their ""California Natural Gas Analysis and Issues"" Staff Report, dated November 2000.  The CEC's more current report from October, 2001, did not include specific long-term demand projections (it is focused on infrastructure issues).

That's the source of the numbers on this slide.",,,The California Energy Commission California Natural Gas Analysis CEC

How are you?  Brett?  Shayne & Summer?  Your family?  I hope everyone is well and coping with all that has happened.  We are fine down here.  My mom & Charlie are coming for a visit next week.  They were flying, but now they're driving.  I think we could all get into the whole family truckster thing again.  Tony & I have decided we probably need the van with the TV/VCR in the ceiling now.  By the way, how is Summer?  What did the doctor have to say about her germ thing, etc?  I hope you all are working through that ok.

I hope you are doing something special for your birthday - going out to dinner with your family & kids and/or maybe a night out with just Brett & you - there's a treat!  Tony & I got a babysitter (one of Sam's teachers) last Saturday for no particular reason and just went out to eat & to a movie (Serendipity - it was a cute romantic comedy.  Just about all I need these days - light & funny & not too much brain power.)

Well, please take the time to celebrate this day - the day we all lucked out and you were born!  Tell Brett it really was his lucky day!  Spend some time with your mom & dad - they were both there =)  And remember the best birthday gift you ever got - the gift of this life - what more wonderful thing could there be?  It was a gift to all of us that have the pure pleasure of knowing you, Margy.  My life would not be the same without you =)

What is the maximum amount of time a workout can be programmed to?

Are there only 10 segments even in a user defined program?  If I wanted 20

																					Public Offered Units of Williams 
																					Energy Partners
																					
																					
																					
																					?  ? Williams will offer the public a 32% stake in its Williams  Energy 
Partners petroleum storage and distribution partnership.  Williams Energy 
Partners filed with the SEC to register 3.75 million  common units, which 
will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol  'WEG'. Williams will own 68% of 
the Williams Energy partnership  after the sale. The partnership consists of 
four petroleum products  terminals along the Gulf Coast and the New York 
harbor, 24 inland  petroleum product terminals and an ammonia pipeline. 
Lehman Brothers  will underwrite the sale which is expected to begin next 
January.  The estimated total proceeds would be about $90 million if the  
underwriters exercise an option to sell an additional 562,500 units  if 
needed to meet investor demand. If that overallotment option is  
																					
																					
																					
																					
																																									
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																exercised, the public would have a 37% stake in the  partnership. The four 
marine terminals have a storage capacity of  more than 17.6 million barrels. 
The 1,100 mile-long pipeline  transports and distributes ammonia from 
production facilities in  Texas and Oklahoma to various distribution points. 
Ammonia is  produced from natural gas and is used primarily as a nitrogen  
fertilizer. Williams did not name an individual price for the common  units. 
It would expect to receive net proceeds of about $70 million  from the sale 
of the 3.75 million common units, based on a?  unit price of $20. WEG will 
use the proceeds, together with $90  million from its line of credit, to 
repay $156 million of debt owned  to Williams. Williams Energy will offer 
holders of the units a  quarterly distribution of $0.52 per unit each 
quarter. Last week,  Williams said third-quarter profit more than quadrupled, 
beating  estimates.

																																		DTE,  MCN Merger to Close Next Year 
																																		
																																		
																																		? ?  DTE Energy Holding says it is unlikely that the merger with MCN  Energy 
Group will close this year. The delay is due to the  companies' decision to 
sell a portion of MCN's natural gas  distribution capacity to a unit of 
Exelon, which is subject to  Michigan PSC review.

																														NYMEX to Launch Online Trading Next Spring
																														
																														
																														
																														?  The NYMEX plans to launch its online trading platform, enymex, in  the 
second quarter of next year. The system will trade and clear  forward 
contracts for physical commodities such as crude oil,  refined products, 
natural gas, electricity and metals. It will  compete with existing ventures 
such as IntercontinentalExchange and  HoustonStreet. Enymex was originally 
set to start in the third  quarter of this year. NYMEX had been in talks on 
joining ICE before  deciding to go it alone.

Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season. Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games. 

Brian Griese <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 12/19/01
Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week. Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/19/01
Henry will miss Sunday's game with a sprained right knee. Shawn Bryson will start in his place. 

Tim Dwight <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to play this week. He has not produced very much this year when healthy.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams. 

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Mason missed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current status is day to day.

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
McNair (back stiffness) missed practice on Tuesday. His current status is day to day. 

Chris Sanders <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Sanders has returned to practice from a back injury. He is not expected to play this week. 

Tony Richardson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 12/19/01
Richardson is day to day with a shoulder injury. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/19/01
Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained hamstring. He is expected to play on Saturday.

Bill Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01
Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder. He might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and gained 73 yards Sunday. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin injury. ""But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games."" Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.

Skip Hicks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12436&>, RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the Nashville Tennessean . ""We're going to play Skip more,"" Fisher said. ""We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.

Amos Zereoue <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.

Gus Frerotte <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1070&>, QB DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.

James Jackson <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 12/18/01
According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jackson could miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.

Scott Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1025&>, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.

Akili Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133415&> , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.

Terry Allen <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/18/01
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. N! on! e of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts. 

Doug Flutie <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 12/18/01
Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.

Priest Holmes <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 12/18/01
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.

Bill Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01
According to the Arizona Republic, Gramatica will miss nine months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament and medial meniscus cartilage in his right knee while celebrating a 42-yard field goal on Saturday against the New York Giants. The Cardinals will audition both Cedrick Oglesby and Vitaly Pisetsky on Tuesday to take Gramatica's place as the team's placekicker. 

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Watters' season has ended with a broken bone in his right ankle. Seattle coach Mike Holmgren said that an MRI test revealed the injury. Holmgren said he will probably put Watters on injured reserve. Watters will decide whether to have an operation on his ankle or let it heal, Holmgren said. The injury puts Shaun Alexander back into the forefront at a crucial time of the year for most Fantasy players. 

Bubba Franks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/17/01
Franks suffered ankle and tailbone injuries on Sunday. His current status is day to day. 

Curtis Conway <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 12/17/01
Conway injured his shin on Saturday against Oakland. His current status is day to day.

Eddie George <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 12/17/01
George was outplayed by Skip Hicks this week, but head coach Jeff Fisher has indicated there is no RB controversy. Hicks will continue to see some carries at George's expense, though.

Frank Player News

Corey Dillon <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 12/18/01
Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/17/01
Thrash bruised his ribs on Sunday. He is not expected to miss any playing time. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 12/16/01
Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough player to start during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 12/16/01
Smith had another good outing, catching five passes for 52 yards and a touchdown against Cleveland. The veteran wide receiver is a must-start every week. 

Jake Plummer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 12/14/01
Plummer may struggle on the road this week. The Giants may dominate a home matchup with the Cardinals. 

Brett Favre <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 12/14/01
Favre should toss at least two TD passes this week. He will certainly exploit every weakness in the vulnerable Tennessee pass defense. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 12/14/01
Schroeder should post good yardage numbers at Tennessee. The Titans' cornerbacks may have trouble with his speed on post and fly routes. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 12/14/01
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Smith's ailing knee has continued to improve, but Bob Christian may get the bulk of the team's carries on Sunday.

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 12/09/01
Bruce caught just three passes for 44 yards against San Francisco. The St. Louis wideout has been a disappointment this year because of his inconsistency, but he is simply too explosive to not remain a starter for any Fantasy team.

Terance Mathis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 12/07/01
Mathis continues to do nothing this season for Fantasy owners. Unless you're in a deeper league, holding onto the veteran wide receiver isn't advisable. 

Olandis Gary <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Titans <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1680&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Tuesday, June 6th all of Gas Assets, everyone under Brenda's direction, will 
be going Bowling.  We will depart the Enron building between 2:45 and 3:15 on 
buses (no not the yellow kind) and we head for Dynamic Lanes, where everyone 
will be placed on a team of 4, bowl three games, compete and cheat (just 
joking) for fabulous prizes and then return to the Enron building around 6:00 
pm, just in time to catch buses and go home.

FAQ
Is it mandatory that I go?

No, BUT you will be gravely missed if you are not there, you will be left out 
of all the inside jokes that are sure to come as a result of this event, and 
you run the risk of being ridiculed by your co-workers for not attending.


 If I don't go bowling can I leave work / stop working at 2:45. ?

If I do go does that mean I do not have to return to work to complete

618,"Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.

631,"Thanks for listening  on last week's phone call.       I have been asked to help Doug Gilbert-Smith get Ercot off of the ground as far as Services and Hourly trading is concerned.     If you have not  heard,   the Entergy and TVA cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets.        This will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these  respective regions.      My inexperience in the term  is the reason given for my implied demotion,   although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for  other players.          This had been the first month that I've had  access to the prompt month and I am up nearly $500k;     there is no doubt in my mind that I was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition.

I have notified Presto that I would be joining Doug in Ercot,   but would be considering other options in Houston,  or even Portland.     I mentioned that I might call you and he has no problem with that.         The job in Houston may be a good opportunity,  however,   the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional  goals.

I am looking for other opportunities,  preferably within the company.     If there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set,  let me know -   I would appreciate your consideration or suggestions.       You certainly are under no obligation to do this,   but I am confident that my track record will generate some interest within the company,   possibly on the retail side.

I've located the Gas Nomination information that was prepared for Dec. 01 and updated to include Jan. 02 business.
The Dec.01 numbers differ slightly from the initial numbers generated by James Centilli at TW as well as the numbers
that Stephanie Miller conveyed in her Dec. 18th memo.  

These values are based on the nomination worksheets & actual power bills from he respective utilities.

tickets you want changed to match the spreadsheet volumes. This will be your 
decision as a trader. If it doesn't matter, then we can choose a deal ticket 
to adjust. Please advise by this afternoon, February 29th.

You have great ideas about consolidating the deal tickets. That is a 
commercial/trader role. Not sure who makes these decisions at Enron. You may 
want to check with your boss, Nelson Ferries or the Desk Director, Dick 
Jenkins. What I have found about Enron, if you have a good idea... just go 
for it... if it makes sense.

If your group does decide to consolidate these tickets... then please have 
the person responsible for inputting your deal tickets to do this 
consolidation. My understanding that Enron has hired someone to help you with 
the billing process for your appalachian producers... not sure if that person 
will also be inputting your deal tickets.

I'll ask Victor about the report by counterparty. CPR print manager has a lot 
of different print options and sorts for the Sitara Deal tickets.

Thanks for your patience!

asked the man, ""Do you have a license to catch those fish?""

The man replied to the game warden, ""No, sir. These are my pet fish.""

""Pet fish?!"" the warden asked.

""Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let
them
swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their
buckets,
and I take em home.""

""O.K. I've GOT to see this!."" The game warden was curious, now.

The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.

After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said,
""Well?""

""Well, What?"" the man responded.

Three other caveats apply:
1-) Some of the numbers that we gave you earlier for some of the other 
programs
may have been updated.
2-) The storage withdrawal that is shown for BG&E's choice program is storage
that we control thru BG&E.  It is not storage that your people will nominate.
3-) As I said earlier, the COH Choice volumes shown as PRIMARY equal
(estimated) total requirements less storage withdrawal, only.  To the extent
that some of the March gas requirement has been previously hedged with you for
physical delivery to the TCO pool per Brian Peronne, we have not deducted 
these

NYMEX announced this afternoon that it will begin trading EFS in natural gas
tomorrow.  Please
read the following memo.


Notice # 01-366
October 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division members
All NYMEX Division cleating members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

It looks like we now have all the descriptions including the Black Knight, so attached below you will find the updated list.  As it turns out, the only career that we had no one fall into is the Doctor.  The career where we had the most people fall into is the White Knight.  So, either we have a lot of good people or a lot of people who like to think of themselves as good.  Which is good, since we have no doctor for our kingdom.

Dear Producers and Shippers,

 In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant 
would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many 
of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz 
area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.  
Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen 
sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, 
CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:

 1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 

 2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and
         processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system. 

 We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian 
Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.  
If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson 
at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.


        Sincerely,

771,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Weather Headlines
Friday October 26, 2001

     ***Cold air in the East will linger through the weekend but will get
rapidly scoured out next week. Next trough set to enter the Western U.S.***

     There is currently a long and strong fetch of NW winds driving cold
air through the Plains and then South and East. Some Lake effect snows are
occurring with this as well though much of the Great Lakes moisture is a
cold rain. Sprawling high pressure covers almost the rest of the country
and the trend in temperature is about to become one of moderation. The
surface high in the Plains will shift to the East coast by early next week
and the NW winds now will shift to the SW allowing the warm up to commence.
It will start in the Plains this weekend and go East of the Mississippi by
Monday. My five day temperature departures are still largely below normal,
but they should be used with caution in a see-saw pattern such as this.
After all some areas(especially in the Plains) may start out 15-20 below
normal today and go 10-15 above normal by Day 5 (Tuesday). By the end of
the period, the Eastern trough will be out to sea, a new trough will invade
the West and Pacific style air will rule coast to coast. That air can be
damp along the West coast, but as it sinks over the mountains it quickly
warms up and dries out. This pattern is allowing the wet season to get
started in the PNW. It appears each successive Pacific storm is getting a
little stronger and forming further South. If the trend continues, we could
start seeing moisture getting into Northern California next week.

     I continue to see good agreement with the models in the 6-10 day
period. The country should remain bathed in Pacific air well into the first
week of November and I believe even beyond. Troughs continue to move into
the West and then in a progressive pattern stay fairly weak in their move
East. Without any blocking in Canada, it is hard for me to see much
likelihood for any arctic air to get entrained. My confidence remains high
in a largely above normal temperature forecast. It is a little less
optimistic in terms of precipitation. I question how much Gulf of Mexico
moisture can be worked back to the North, but some models suggest the
Plains could get wet next week. I have not discussed the tropics much this
week because there has not been a storm to mention. There still isn't, but
the overall pattern we are going into next week can in a climatological
sense sometimes crank something up in the Caribbean and push it North
towards Florida. My guess is there will not be a named storm as such, but
some potential for heavy rain.

For the period Friday October 26 through Tuesday October 30, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 7 to 9-degrees below normal: Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, Southeast...

Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Northeast, Mississippi
Valley

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Plains,  Pacific NW...

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: California, Rockies...

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Desert SW, Intermountain West...

Weather Headlines
Wednesday November 21, 2001

*** Battle develops between tropical ridge in the Atlantic and Arctic air
flooding Canada. The Atlantic ridge will prevail? for now.***

     A series of weather systems will move into the West Coast and head
East through the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. While the pattern will be
more active than recent weeks, no one big storm is likely to bring travel
problems on a large scale. In addition, there is little additional cold air
available to spin up a Winter Storm, so most precip will be in the form of
light to moderate rain. Exceptions to this will be the mountains of the
West where ski resort snows will fall. Also, the far Northern reaches of
the U.S. could see some light snows. Temperature departures are expected to
go largely above normal again with the highest numbers in the North, though
not to the degree of earlier in the month. Negative numbers though not
significant are confined to the West where storms come in off the ocean and
in the Southeast where this time of year is not cold anyway.

     Models are going wild with a winter storm early in the 6-10 day
period. I suspect surface pressures are a little overdone given the upper
level flow. However, the Gulf will be open and some significant moisture
and wind are possible. The storm track will be well North which confines
snow to the Northern U.S. Significant winter weather though from Wyoming to
Minnesota is possible. The large scale pattern ending November will be for
a trough to sit in the Interior West while a strong ridge exists over the
Southeast.  There is still plenty of arctic air available in Canada, but
with the jet stream in a broad West to SW flow, no means of delivery appear
available until at least December 1'st. In a general sense, I look for
temperatures to be below normal in the West with above normal in the South
and East. The North is somewhat a question mark being closer to the arctic
air and could go either way. I'll lean to normal for now.

For the period Wednesday November 21 through Sunday November 25, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic,
Pacific NW?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Ohio and Mississippi Valleys, Great
Lakes, Southern Plains, California, Desert SW?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Rockies, Intermountain West, Central
Plains?

Average 7 to 10-degrees above normal:  Northern Plains?

832,"The Pastoria DASH each of you signed last week has been modified at the 
request of Jeff Skilling and Rebecca Carter.  Late Friday afternoon, West 
Power was advised to value the gas transportation on a PV10 rather than VaR 
basis.  The impact of this change was to increase the cost of the gas 
transportation from $34MM to $102.3MM.  The $102.3MM is a worst-case scenario 
in that it assumes none of the capacity can be resold.

Also, RAC has advised that no new signatures will be required for the revised 
DASH.  

The revised DASH will be considered by the Enron Executive Committee this 
afternoon in a special meeting along with other projects.

Attached for you convenience are (1) the original DASH (DASH dev final 
dg.doc), (2) the final DASH before the Executive Committee 
(DASH_Pastoria4_030901) and (3) a redlined comparision of the final to the 
original (DASH_Pastoria4_0309091_redlined).  Most all highlighted changes 
reflect the substitution PV for VaR.  A few minor changes were also made.

the financial burden weighing on Nevada's major utility companies, and in=
=20
fact raises the possibility for further debts that Sierra Pacific and Nevad=
a=20
Power may have to carry to comply with several of the measure's related=20
requirements. =20

The key provision of Assembly Bill 369 blocks the sale of power plants befo=
re=20
July 1, 2007, although Nevada utilities will be allowed to apply to the=20
Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) for plant sales that include a=
=20
state of ""substantial financial emergency"" after July 1, 2003. The measure=
=20
directly impacts a pending sale to AES Corp. of a 14-percent interest (220=
=20
MW) in the Mohave Generating Station, located in Laughlin, Nev., that is=20
presently owned by Nevada Power. AES had agreed to pay $133.5 million for t=
he=20
14-percent interest in the plant. Under terms of the state's restructuring=
=20
legislation, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power were ordered to sell the=
ir=20
power plants to alleviate concerns about market power. Toward that end, the=
=20
holding company and its wholly owned utility subsidiaries commenced a publi=
c=20
auction of approximately 2,900 MW of power generation facilities. =20

Of Sierra Pacific Resources' nine power plants, which are mostly fired by=
=20
natural gas and coal, seven had been entered into sales agreements and were=
=20
awaiting final approval when this Assembly measure was passed. The PUCN had=
=20
actually approved the sale of the Mohave plant last year, representing the=
=20
first sales transactions of one of the utilities' plants. However, since th=
e=20
PUCN granted its approval of the Mohave plant, Nevada officials have grown=
=20
increasingly concerned about instability in the Western power markets and t=
he=20
power supply problems in California. =20

Tom Hay, chief of the Nevada Attorney General's Bureau of Consumer=20
Protection, initiated the block against the sale out of concern about power=
=20
supply in the state. Specifically, Hay proposed that the Mohave plant shoul=
d=20
remain under the control of Nevada Power for the time being because it burn=
s=20
coal, a low-cost fuel that can be relied upon to stave off blackouts in the=
=20
state. In addition, Hay raised the concern that, should the sale of the pla=
nt=20
be approved, the new owner AES could decide to sell the power produced by t=
he=20
plant outside of the state after a two-year buy back agreement expires in=
=20
2003. By keeping the Mohave and other generating plants under the ownership=
=20
of Nevada utilities, state officials believe that they can retain regulator=
y=20
control over the price of power. =20

Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn agreed that the plants should not be sold at th=
is=20
time and said that keeping the plants would protect Nevadans against high=
=20
prices on the wholesale power markets. Guinn also expressed his intention t=
o=20
block restructuring in the state throughout his term as governor, which end=
s=20
in 2003. If he is elected for a second term and can see that the markets ha=
ve=20
stabilized in the West, Guinn said he would consider allowing competition i=
n=20
the state sometime after 2003.=20

For its part, AES says that it will seek legal action to force the sale of=
=20
the plant to proceed. AES argues that the Nevada Assembly's measure is not=
=20
constitutional and violates the sales contract already approved by the PUCN=
.=20
AES also pointed out that the Mohave plant is 30 years old and will require=
=20
significant repairs and improvement, an investment that it was willing to=
=20
make but one that would cause an unnecessary financial burden on Nevada=20
Power.=20

Moreover, the negative financial impact that the Nevada Assembly's measure=
=20
might cause is a major point of contention for Nevada Power and Sierra=20
Pacific (along with the two Assembly members who voted against the measure)=
.=20
A spokesperson for the utilities said pending sales of power plants would=
=20
provide the two companies with about $1 billion in cash, which ""would go a=
=20
long way to help us buy fuel and purchase power."" As I discussed in my 3/8/=
01
IssueAlert the utilities' parent company Sierra Pacific Resources continues=
=20
to struggle financially, so much so that a pending acquisition of Portland=
=20
General has now been scrapped. Sierra Pacific Resources reported a=20
significant fourth-quarter loss ($18.2 million) as a result of soaring cost=
s=20
of power in the western United States. The company incurred losses as a=20
direct result of ""the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased power in th=
e=20
volatile wholesale market."" The company attributed the latest quarter's los=
s=20
to nearly $258 million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs.=20
Although the Nevada Assembly's measure passed with a 9-2 vote, one assembly=
=20
member recognized the fact that if ""we weaken [the utilities] to the point=
=20
where they can't borrow to purchase fuel, we won't have power."" Consequentl=
y,=20
the state could still find itself with a compromised power supply, despite=
=20
its efforts to retain state control over existing power plants.=20

Additional financial burden could be placed on Nevada Power and Sierra=20
Pacific as a result of other requirements that are included in related=20
Assembly measures. For instance, AB 418 calls for gradually increasing the=
=20
amount of green power used by the utilities to 15 percent (from its current=
=20
0.2 percent). The bill allows for the PUCN to fine the utilities $10,000 a=
=20
day or a total of $3 million for failing to buy the required amount of=20
renewable energy. Although a representative of Sierra Pacific Resources sai=
d=20
that the company supports the use of renewable power, the Assembly measure'=
s=20
requirement was considered ""so much, so quick, so fast.""=20

The block on the power sales and indefinite delay in the start of competiti=
on=20
essentially returns Nevada to a re-regulated state. This is another example=
=20
of the continuing fallout that has resulted from the California energy=20
crisis, especially among neighboring states in the West. As another example=
,=20
New Mexico recently decided to also delay the start of competition until=20
2007. Western states, which in one way or another have felt the direct impa=
ct=20
of the power crunch in California, have become more cautious about=20
deregulation and seemingly are in no hurry to open their markets to=20
competition (despite the fact that deregulation proceeds in other areas of=
=20
the country).=20

However, unlike California, where the state government now has an active ro=
le=20
in purchasing power and may take over the utilities' transmission assets,=
=20
Nevada Gov. Guinn has expressed no interest in having the state or local=20
governments take over the jobs of electric utility companies. Rather, Guinn=
=20
merely wants to retain the control that the state traditionally has had ove=
r=20
setting utility cost-based rates, an authority that would become diluted if=
=20
out-of-state power companies own generation assets located in Nevada.=20
Further, Guinn wants to return to deferred energy rates (also known as=20
fuel-adjustment clauses), in which a utility is allowed to seek=20
dollar-for-dollar adjustments in rates to recover costs associated with=20
purchasing power on the wholesale market. As opposed to monthly rate=20
increases, Guinn believes that an annual rate increase=01*which Nevada Powe=
r and=20
Sierra Pacific would have to request and justify=01*would ""smooth out the u=
ps=20
and downs of power and fuel costs over the year."" In addition, Guinn believ=
es=20
that the combination of state regulation and cost-based rates offers a bett=
er=20
strategy for the state than attempting retail competition at this time. To=
=20
supplement power supply, Guinn believes that Nevada should promote the use =
of=20
merchant plants rather than relying on the incumbent utilities to build=20
additional generation. =20

Moreover, the Nevada Assembly measure brings competition in the state to a=
=20
screeching halt (at least for the next few years). However, the larger issu=
e=20
at hand presently is the precarious financial state of Sierra Pacific=20
Resources and its utilities. Without the cash that would have been gained=
=20
from the sales of its power plants, it is unclear how Sierra Pacific=20
Resources will be able to pull itself out of debt. The utility already=20
received an emergency rate increase last month, so any attempt to secure=20
additional increases would surely be politically unpopular. Gov. Guinn's=20
proposal regarding deferred energy rates may provide a mechanism to bring=
=20
Sierra Pacific's rates more in line with its costs, but most likely such a=
=20
rate increase would take effect only once a year. Meanwhile, Sierra Pacific=
=20
must still procure some power on the wholesale market, where prices remain=
=20
high (a situation that could get ever worse this summer if warm temperature=
s=20
drive up demand). Thus, ironically, as much as state officials have tried t=
o=20
avoid the energy crisis found in its western neighbor, Nevada is increasing=
ly=20
exhibiting some of the same fundamental problems found in California. =20

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.

        Formal Complaint - Docket UE-001952 

        This week, the Commission is hearing evidence regarding the level of 
a ""soft
        cap"" on prices PSE charges some large customers. 

        On January 26, Public Counsel and Commission Staff filed a joint 
answer on
        the rate cap mechanism. 

        On Jan. 22, the UTC approved a temporary ""soft-price"" cap for power 
rates
        paid by 13 large industrial customers of Puget Sound Energy (PSE). A
        short-term soft cap would allow PSE to charge above the cap for power 
costs
        if the utility was paying more than a maximum level. 

        The order calls for a second set of proceedings to establish the 
level of the
        temporary soft cap as a term under the provisions of Schedule 48 and 
the
        PSE/Georgia-Pacific Special Contract. The cap would be in place 
pending
        further proceedings to determine a final disposition of Schedule 48.

handling that Sarah or do you want me to?

FERC has stated in several orders what it considers ""material changes"".  You 
may want to look at Duke and Consumers procedures to make sure you are Ok 
with the interpretations.  Those are some of the orders that I would look to 
should a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change.

Also, per your comments on No. 16.  I agree with you on ""commenced 
construction.""  What I mean by ""commenced"" includes the utility purchase of 
easements, etc.  I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing 
to live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to 
proceed and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the 
costs.  [[Customer may want to wait to proceed until it sees the FERC 
decision.]]  Thanks.

You must be up to your ears in administrative paperwork.

I just wanted to touch base about our discussions.  You said that it would
be to your advantage to start some sort of analysis review this year
(budgets??), if this is still important we can still get started.  We can
start with one or more people with 48 hours notice.  We have a team on

Attached is follow-up analysis that Kenny Bickett, John Garrison and I have completed on the Azurix potential asset sales and impairments.  The analysis reflects a $305 million charge, or $294 million after tax.

We have assumed asset values that we would place at the 90% confidence level.  These numbers are slightly higher than you saw before as a result of (1)  our taking a 90% confidence level approach and (2) further analysis on Lurgi which reflects an impairment based upon a controlled shut-down alternative rather than a sale.  The numbers also include our recent litigation settlement, Azurix Corp severances, and Azurix Corp PP&E impairments.

We would be available at any time to discuss this analysis with you.  Since AA has not reviewed any of this information, the next step is to get AA to confirm the analysis and numbers.  We will wait on your approval to take this step.  Please let me know when to proceed.


Thanks,

In the past, we have negotiated our audit fees with AA separate from Enron.  In addition, we are billed separate from Enron.  This is the time of year that I would plan on starting discussions with AA for 2001 audit fees.  Estimated fees for 2000 were approximately $1mm which includes statutory audits for certain entities in addition to the overall US GAAP audit.  

What is the policy/guideline under which we should proceed with AA?  Would Enron prefer to negotiate this in their overall discussion for the Enron audit and then allocate to Azurix an appropriate amount?

Pursuant to your request, I have visited PGE last week and had conversations with the respective PGE employees. Below are my conclusions and analysis.

In Retrospect (Jan-01 - Sep-01)

Background
During this period PGE has negotiated a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism that limits PGE risks and rewards. According to this mechanism, PGE is responsible for only 10% of the costs in excess of $232.5 MM. Earlier in the year, PGE has accumulated the length for the 2001-2002 period that appreciated in value significantly as prices were increasing. Since liquidations on the hedges are included in the power costs, this value has offset the company's power costs and pushed the total cost of power in the deadband, where PGE wears 100% of risks and rewards.

Earnings Impact
As prices continued to decline against the long position, PGE incurred significant power costs from its hedge liquidations and moved through the deadband, where the Company wears 100% of the downside.

Other items that impacted earning included:
	- reduced load during the period
	- reserves for CA receivables
	- losses in spec trading

For the remainder of the PCA, through the end of Sep-01, PGE is only responsible for 10% of the incurred power costs.

Analysis
In my opinion, the following factors have affected PGE's decision to maintain the length in a bearish market:

	- bullish or not as bearish sentiment among traders
	- reliability issues: PGE has significant political and financial repercussions for being caught short in a blackout
	- psychological fears of tight power supplies and potential blackouts/brownouts, mainly because of recent situation in CA

Next 15 Months (Oct-01 - Dec-02)

PGE has agreed to implement a similar PCA mechanism for the next 15 months. Below are the highlights:
	
- PGE is currently negotiating the base cost level with the PUC. This is a critical step to ensure that PGE's estimate of the 15-months baseline power costs, as agreed with 	the PUC, is equal to or greater than the actual costs for the period (~$984 MM)
- the new PCA provides for tighter bands (+/- $28 MM for 100% exposure)
- transmission costs, resulting from load variations are not factored into the PCA mechanism
- Given tighter bands, PGE will begin to place greater emphasis on the spec book - MTM earnings

Beyond 2002

PGE is naturally short beyond 2002 (load exceeds generation and hedges). PGE could begin discussions with the PUC on the structure of a new PCA mechanism to limit their risk and rewards; or move towards greater deregulation. There is a possibility that PGE will loose some of its industrial commercial load during this time period, with an obligation to take them back at a standard offer.

In the meantime, the Company began purchasing power for the 2003-2004 time period to cover residential load.

Recommendations/Action Steps

1. Design decision authority process for significant business decisions. In retrospect, it would be helpful to analyze the value of the long position against the cost of reliability and make a decision accordingly. Other examples: should PGE apply for a PCA mechanism past 2002, should PGE be purchasing power for 2003-2004. Also, participate regularly in the PGE Risk Management Committee meetings.

2. Continue to improve trading controls (missed a deal earlier in the year resulting in a $10 MM loss in the spec book). Significant improvements have been made since then.
	- move settlements function under middle office to ensure segregation of duties - currently reports through the commercial function
	- capture option exposure ASAP or prohibit option trading: PGE has an option trade in the books that is not captured in the risk management and reporting 			framework (position, P&L and VaR)
	- develop processes for capturing other exposures:
		Interest rates, embedded in commodity cash flows and assets
		Foreign currency, resulting from transactions with Canadian counterparties in CAD$
		Heating Oil #2, PGE has ~ 1 MM Bbls in storage at the Beaver Plant
		Coal, two-year contract for supply of coal to the Boardman Plant

3. Daily reporting of PGE risks: VaR, Positions and P&L, notifications of limit violations; as well as, notification of important transactions (purchase of 2003-2004 power)

4. Input/coordination with EWS on important trading decisions. Insights from the West Desk could help PGE make better trading decisions.

5. Periodic review of trading controls - add PGE to the list of Doorstep projects.

es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss=
ions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these meetings will star=
t next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac=
teristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach to f=
ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The order =
states, ""We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the=
 Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible.""  =
The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may b=
e more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market develo=
pment, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal=
e electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the media=
tion as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta=
rting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other =
aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managm=
ent, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, I am=
 attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the or=
der is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs ar=
e making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  The=
refore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and fi=
le a compliance filing within 90 days.

If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.

prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks

960,"Talked with John Hodge further about the Transco Expansion from Zone 3 to 4 
(Mommentum).  Transco tossed out a rate of $.32 (100% load factor) plus 2.35% 
fuel plus $.026 commodity.  If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095 
fuel), then the total rate is $.44.  

Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Co.'s can pay Transco $.44 or 
purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $.22 which would 
netback to Elba at Hub +$.22.  If you assume a basis of $.04 for gas on 
Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $.26.  Note that a hard 
negotiation with Transco could net a better rate than $.44 and that this is 
only what they are proposing.

However, I do not think we will get anywhere close to that with Southern Co. 
given that they can site generation in Zone 2 (Alabama) vs. Zone 3 
(Georgia).  Additionally, most power developers will not commit to a baseload 
quantity given that they will serving a peaking market.  Our alternative is 
to sell to existing firm shippers on the Sonat system that would view Elba as 
a savings on variable cost on their FT agreement.  The net is a Hub +$.10 at 
Elba assuming a basis of $.04 at Destin.  

Southern Co. has stated that a price of Hub +$.20 was out of the question.  
Probably between their bid of $.12 vs. Hub + $.20 is where we could strike a 
deal with them.

971,"To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

974,"With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

A flight attendant claims she was bumped by a passenger's bag,
then removes that passenger for not apologizing. Can she do that?

            <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><font size=""-1"">It is 
              more important than ever to take control of your finances. How will 
              all the world and financial events affect your ability to achieve 
              your personal financial goals? What could or should you consider 
              doing differently? As a valued client, your advisor can help you 
              develop confidence that you are on your way to meet your desired 
              financial goals.</font></font></p>
            <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><font size=""-1"">You have 
              already worked hard to develop a sound and clear financial plan 
              that is right for your personal situation. But of course things 
              change. In these times of market uncertainty, now may be a good 
              time to review your goals and plan with your advisor. Through that 
              process, you can adjust your financial strategies to match this 
              dynamic marketplace and your changing needs, keeping you on track 
              to meet your financial goals. </font></font></p>
            <p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><font size=""-1"">Given 
              the new realities of the financial markets, careful planning is 
              more important than ever. For instance, you may want to consider 
              having your portfolio address a balance of both short-and long-term 
              objectives. Depending upon your situation, investment options can 
              range from a variety of stable-value, income-producing cash reserve 
              products to a wide range of mutual funds and stocks. Your advisor 
              can help you choose the investment types that can help provide an 
              appropriate balance of risk and return for you while helping you 
              to meet your goals. </font></font></p>

Standard Chartered Bank as I had indicated to you earlier.  I addressed with 
them our desire to potentially use the facility that they give us as a bridge 
loan in the event we were to purchase assets in the range of $75-90,000,000.  
Even though this is not a committed facility, I ask that they give us their 
assurance that this facility was not in jeopardy and that they bank was 
pleased with the line and line of business.  They were able to give me that 
assurance, and in fact had planned on asking for more business at the lunch.  
This group is the commodities arm of the bank and the natural resources group 
produces over 75% of the revenue stream for the entire group.  They are 
currently at 60% in excess of their budget for year 2000.  This is important 
because banks generally do not cut off strong revenue generating arms.  

There are global issues, as they calculate exposure to us into the total 
exposure that they give to Enron companies ( not supported by Enron, but they 
look at their internal exposure in the aggregate).  Standard Chartered just 
bought the Grindlays bank in India and of course there well be added exposure 
there.  They plan on revising their limits to accommodate that and did not 
feel that this hinder our line in anyway.  They also stated that in the event 
that the market went contango in the interim, they would entertain a short 
term increase over the current limits if it was needed.  

as a reminder the limits are:  $150,000,000 in inventory financing L+ .55 - 
.75
                                          $100,000,000 in account receivable

Bob Hill has asked that I write this note to obtain an exemption from the 
standing policy of not making investments outside of North America 
(established by the MPL Policy Committee) if you would like us to proceed 
with the investment evaluation of GATX .   If the policy exemption is not 
granted, we will discontinue our efforts and focus resources on other areas.  
Here is some background information that might be useful in making your 
decision.

Business - GATX Terminals business unit is in engaged in the storage and 
distribution services to petroleum and chemical customers worldwide.  The 
assets consist of 17 terminaling facilities, ownership interest in 4 refined 
product pipelines, and 11 joint ventures, which in aggregate have a book 
value approximating $1 billion.  The business generated $26 million of net 
income in 1999 on $294 million of gross income and employs approximately 
1,000 employees.

I have been informed that roughly half of the business operations lie outside 
of U.S. borders.  Significant terminal operations are located in Asia and 
some in Europe.  Also, the pipeline business segment has operations in the 
U.K. and Mexico.  Since this deal is a planned cash for stock transaction, 
the opportunity to cherry pick U.S. assets is not an option.

Foreign Taxation Issue - In general, investments outside the U.S. lessens the 
tax efficiency structure that partners value and currently enjoy.  In 
addition, foreign income taxes will complicate a unitholder's tax return 
filing.

Qualified Income - According to David Boryck, distribution of petroleum and 
chemicals to end-users is not qualified income.  It is unknown to me, how 
much of the business this represents for GATX...potential issue.

Investment Portfolio Character - Given the size and nature of this business, 
this transaction would change the character of NBP's investment portfolio.  

Competitive Bid - Other bidders in the industry will have an advantage in 
finding G&A cost efficiencies with merging this operation into their 
business, putting us at a disadvantage in the bidding process.

The above two issues can be mitigated by jointly bidding with a strong 
operating partner.  

Cash Flow Impact - I have not seen any numbers, but assuming the transaction 
is accretive, the scope of this investment should have positive impact on MLP 
cash flows.

Please provide your feedback.

Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

Larry, very interesting reports.   It may be wise for TW (and other 
companies) to monitor and comment through channels you consider appropriate 
on the developing proposals for the statutes waiving immunity for contract 
claims.  This reminds me of a discussion I had with Steve Boos (who as you 
know is legislative counsel to the Council (or a similar title)  at a CLE in 
Albuquerque.  We discussed the effort last year to provide a limited waiver 
which he suggested he favored, and he asked whether it would be an inducement 
for business to invest on reservation to have a waiver of immunity for suits 
on contracts with the Nation.  Of course, I said it would be and we talked 
briefly about what states and the U. S. do.  I'd be interested in further 
intelligence on that initiative.

I'd also appreciate a copy of the agenda for the financial meetings.

Thanks for your always valuable window on Window Rock.

I am going to work up a plan for getting much of #2 done before the September 
board meeting, so that we can develop some rough proactive overall position 
on wholesale before December.  Can't make promises yet.

It would be most helpful to me if I could give concrete examples about new 
uniform practices can be a win-win in wholesale markets.  Do you know of any 
examples we can use of practices that we really wish we already had?  I'm

Expansion project.  Have you applied with FERC?  Is there any opportunity
for our company to submit a proposal for the project?  Would you like to see
a Qualification Package that expands on our experience?

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Hugoton-Panhandle area. The Mid-Continent region included in this region are 
the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Districts 7B, 9, and 10 in the 
state of Texas. The report contains drilling programs by operator, the number 
of wells first delivered in each area, rig activities as well as gas 
production volumes. Historical production volumes are reported both annually 
and quarterly and displayed both tabular and graphically.  

The cost for this report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the

As a follow up to our recent discussions concerning the SoCalGas RLS or
peaking rate, I am forwarding to you the proposed decision of ALJ Brown.  My
understanding is that at yesterday's Commission meeting the Commission made
a decision to approve a change to the current peaking rate tariff.  I should
have their decision within a couple working days.  I am forwarding their
draft decision.

The expected PD rate design for the new peaking rate would include SFV rate
design principals, demand charges determined over highest recorded usage
over a 12 month period, and inclusion of public purpose program charges.  At
this point we'll call it a modified cost of service approach.

If you have any questions, please call.

1066,"As you may know, today was the fifth day that Enron Kids board has setup on 2nd floor of the Enron bldg asking employees to adopt a child from Gordon Elementary.  This school is 98% minority, free lunch and breakfast, showed improvements in their test scores over last year, and the students are 100% bused from low income arears thoughout Houston.  The total roster for 2001 is 468 students.  As of 4pm today 11/16/01, we have only had 214 students choosen.  We also emailed all participants from last year and gave them the opportunity to choose Monday before the other employees had a chance. 
We on the Enron Kids board realise the problems everyone is facing at Enron, put fell we could get 3/4's of the students chosen if we could send an email across the system.  Most of the people who have participated said they didn't know about it but saw us on the 2nd floor, or they said they never read Enron in Action.  
To help cut down and try to give employees the opportunity to adopt additional children, the Enron Kids board have decided to eliminate the shoes and coat, previously purchased in the prior years, thus reducing the price per child to $100.  If we can get the majority chosen that remain, we could use the money left from last year to purchase gift certificates for every student at a discount from Pay Less.  Also the board thinks that we can complete a low number of unchoosen students for $80 if we shop wisely and in a number that the retailer will give us a discount.
Please, Enron Kids board is only asking that a memo simular to what Misha received this week go out accross Enron, but realizing we need to specify the days (Tues 11/27 thru 11/30 on level 2 of the Enron Bldg), from 11am til 1pm.  Also we have plans of selling excess Enron Kids T-shirts for $10 each the week the students gifts are turned in 12/10 thru 12/14.  This money would either help adopt the remaining children, or if excess, use to purchase library books for their school as was done in the past years. 
If you need to talk to someone next week, please call Kevin Hyatt, Vice President of Enron Kids, or Lesli Campbell X 35983.  I will be on vacation, put will call in Tuesday and Wednesday to check the status because we have a lot of co-ordinating to do if we do this again 11/27 thru 11/30.
Thank you for taking the time to consider oursituation and hopfully allowing Enron Kids to be visable in an email to hope that more students will be chosen.",Misha Kevin Hyatt,100 80 10,Enron Kids board Enron Gordon Elementary Pay Less Enron Kids Lesli Campbell

Title: Hidden Risks: Microbasis in the Short-term Gas Markets 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2826;


***********************************************************************

STRUCTURAL RISK AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY GROW IN INFLUENCE IN REGIONAL GAS 
MARKETS. 

The dramatic increase of participants in the daily market for natural gas over 
the past several years has brought with it the demand for pricing indices that 
are increasingly regional and selective in nature. These published indices 
provide a valuable service to the market, but the high level of confidence that 
the general trading community has bestowed upon them may be misplaced.

*  Current economic conditions are masking hidden volatility potential, 
especially at local index points that have unrealized demand potential.

*  Large, volatile demand in the form of new gas-fired generation utilizes the 
existing pipeline system in ways that were never envisioned in the original 
system design.
 
*  Control of pipeline infrastructure has moved from the relatively benign 
local distribution companies to economically driven traders and asset managers.
 
*  As demand grows, physical flexibility in the system and the number of buyers 
and sellers decrease on the margin.

Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program

	Hey Kevin,
	Here is my resume......somewhat updated.  I would like to have an
	opportunity to meet and provide a more detail discussion about my
	background and accomplishments that may be a really good fit for
	what ET&S is working towards.  

	Overall I've been with Enron since September of 1989.  My resume
	doesn't go back that far, but I started with Enron Gas Pipeline Operating
	Company (EGPOC) working with Transwestern and then Northern Natural.
	
	I'd like to see Enron grow and develop the asset part of our business
	and I truly believe that I can help accomplish that.  I have a strong history
	of getting things accomplished and I'm a firm believer in the win-win 
	business perspective. I also know how to work through the Enron
	organization to help get pricing, information, etc..

	I would like to establish an interview/meeting as soon as possible in
	order to be able to fully evaluate the opportunity.
	
	I would also appreciate that we keep this correspondence between
	us and the appropriate people within ET&S.

	Thanks,
	mk

1075,"I've attached (admittedly incomplete) the Project Check List for a proposed gas-fired electric generation plant to be located off TW and EPNG near Belen, N.M.  The customer has requested that TW provide an estimate to construct an interconnect with both TW and EPNG and to build the lateral pipeline facility to their plant site.  I've attached below a copy of the email I received yesterday from Steve Rutherford requesting this estimate.  This project (at least as far as TW is concerned) is in its earliest stage of development.  However, in order to proceed, the customer would like a (+/- 30%) estimate from TW in order to factor in the interconnects/lateral costs into its economics.  On a parallel path, I'll be working on the deal structure with the customer to provide adequate payback and return of investment in the facility, along with operating costs and return.

Please provide me a timetable for getting an estimate out to this customer.  I know they asked for next Monday, but I've already sent them a note indicating it might take a bit longer.  Also, if you need additional information in order to provide this estimate, please don't hesitate to contact Steve Rutherford directly.  I'd only ask that if you email him, you'd copy me on the email for my files.  Thanks.

There are a multitude of cases run on this project over time and it's hard for everyone to pick the most current.  Please refer any facility questions to Planning and Optimization so we can respond with the most current information.  Arnold is right where the pipe lengths are but has the wrong story why.

1077,"No.  Because of the problems that occurred with the swing loads, we had to go back to the fully looped line.  Running steady state wasn't a problem but trying to meet peaks was with the 174.6 miles.  Since Planning has been guessing at what the customer wants in the way of swing capability, TW needs to nail that part down so Planning can run a GOOD analysis.  We can barely meet the 16-hour day load at 750 MMcf/d average day condition but can not at the 16-hour day at 1000 MMcf/d scenario even with fully looped pipe.  We (Planning) can run a multitude of cases that may or may not work and still may not hit the one the customer needs).  Let's get together to discuss again to make sure everyone is on the same page.  Bits and pieces from separate groups can cause problems with the true scope of work.  I would suggest you, Kevin, Ben, and myself to establish a project scope to be carried out from this day forward.  Let me know what you think about having a meeting.

quickly as conditions allow after the required permits are received by Enron

I received the following Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement for Ormet

included specifically for the transaction currently being executed.

I want to strike this language from the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.

Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold"", and is highlighted in blue:

""Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Customer agree to 
negotiate in good faith a netting agreement that will eliminate or reduce the 
need for a letter of credit to be supplied by Customer and that until such 
netting agreement is executed by the parties, a Letter of Credit under this

in the Master agreement.

1146,"Attached is a draft transaction agreement for October 2000, the assumed 
maintenance
month during the MW Turndown time period.   The boiler-plate language is 
identical to
the document sent to you earlier.  The only changes are to the DCQ, Delivery 
Points, and
Contract Price language for Part I.  These changes incorporate Sithe's 
concerns that 
the month of October should be divided in two parts, one when the full plant 
is available
and the other when the only one block is available.  For invoicing purposes, 
it has been
assumed the GSA sales reduction tied to one block being down for 15 days 
would keep
ENA whole for what the GSA sales volumes would have been if there had not 
been a MW
Turndown transaction.  We have not yet verified if this is an accurate 
assumption, so some
additional adjustments to the volumes/time period may still be required.

1149,"Article II of the NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT entered in connection with the 
sale of HPL to AEP (which closed as of June 1,2001) provides:

 ""ENA [for 3 months post-close] will not  solicit, negotiate or enter into 
any contract, agreement or arrangement for the purchase of natural gas on the 
HPL Pipeline from any Person which is a supplier or producer of natural gas 
connected to the HPL Facilities; provided, however, nothing herein shall be 
construed or interpreted as prohibiting ENA from entering into any such 
contract, agreement or arrangement which is less than one month in duration 
and involves or is related to an Enron Online transaction."" 

 This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much 
negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the  original scope 
proposed by AEP.  Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any 
solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our 
limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months.  There are 
many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation 
between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the 
risks and rewards of ""stepping too close to or over the line"".

Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only 
applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if 
there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian 
Redmond and me.

Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need 
to be aware of this limited restriction.

we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep

about that.  However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is 
always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master 
would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.  Unless you know of a reason 
to the contrary, I would think we want to open them for weather.

Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to 
mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular 
out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of 
Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it

1278,"I would like to clear up a confusing situation with Ameren which is currently 
taking place: 

On 8/29, Ameren Service Company (""ASC"") they asked us to take them off EOL, 
apparently because they now want to trade in EOL under the name ""Ameren 
Energy Inc. as agent"". 

On 8/29, Legal said OK to taking ASC off EOL and said further that AEI's 
approval to trade on EOL was ""on-hold"" until Legal checked out the agency 
aspect. Despite this - AEI appears to have been trading on EOL since 8/16 and 
the confirmations we have been receiving back have been marked up by them. 
They are trying to change the name on the confirmations to AEI acting as 
agent for various entities.  I instructed Stephanie Sever yesterday to make 
sure that AEI either acting for itself OR acting as agent does not have 
access to EOL. This needs to stay the case until Legal directs otherwise. 

Just so everyone is aware, Leslie Hansen spoke with Ameren several weeks ago 
and told them that they would need to sign a special Consent Form as well as 
a modified ETA before AEI could act as an agent on EOL. The forms were 
emailed to them on 8/22 and to my knowledge, they have not been returned to 
us.  I have left messages for the Ameren's attorney to call me but she has 
not done so yet.  In any case, until they return the requested documents, 
they cannot trade on EOL. 

With regard to Ameren Service Company, today they appear to want to be back 
on EOL. That is fine so long as it is clear that they are doing so under the 
documentation that they signed originally. 

If anyone has questions, please call me on ext. 39477

1288,"Peter, I have considered your issue in point three below and, further to our 
discussion, I believe that the issue is addressed in Paragraph 8(d) of the 
credit support annex.  That paragraph indicates that, upon termination, where 
no amounts are payable by Pledgor (the party that has posted collateral) to 
Secured Party (the party holding the posted collateral), the Secured Party 
will transfer all posted collateral (plus interest if the posted collateral 
is cash) to the Pledgor.  Therefore, although in your third example Bow 
Valley would be required to post a letter of credit for the $15 million, upon 
termination ECC would owe the $240 million to Bow Valley and Paragraph 8(d) 
would kick in, such that ECC would be required to return the letter of credit 
to Bow Valley and pay the $240 million.  The mechanism set forth in Paragraph 
8(d) clearly makes sense in a multi-transaction situation but doesn't really 
make sense in this situation, since, in your third example, ECC could call 
for a letter of credit from Bow Valley knowing full well that it will never 
be able to actually use it, thereby simply making Bow Valley incur the cost 
of posting the letter of credit.  However, I think this is a point that we 
should leave for the bank to raise, if they are concerned about it.  
Practically speaking, I would think that, given these facts, ECC would simply 
not call for the letter of credit from Bow Valley in your third example, as 
it provides no real protection.

I guess the only other point to be made is that, if the index were to go to a 
price of less than $0.25 per GJ, such that the amount owed to Bow Valley 
under Swap 1 was reduced from $300 million to less than $15 million, ECC 
holding the letter of credit would make sense.

After reading the requirements below, it sounds like the two signature rule

In other words, can we set up Steve as well as his users with Physical access

Re Japanese counterparties which want to do weather, the safest approach for

CONTRACTS [NYMEX RULE 9.04(P) AND COMEX RULE 4.37(A)]

______________________________________________________________________________

As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX Division metals 
contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day prior to the 
first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the delivery month.  
Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for the 
December 2000 metals contracts must be completed prior to November 15, 2000.

Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX 
energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the 
respective contracts.  Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are attached.

If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact Nick Galati 
at (212) 299-2920 or Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919.

COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the concurrent position 
is established the business day prior to the date that the open positions are 
filed with the Clearing House.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery month for 
metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth (10th) 
business day, prior to the first business day of the delivery month.
The current delivery month for Eurotop futures commences on the open of 
trading on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the termination of the 
respective futures contract, including the termination date.

NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE

(P) Concurrent Futures Positions

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent 
position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset 
memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing 
such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay 
in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its 
clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing 
member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the 
clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for 
energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third 
business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract, 
including the termination date.  The current delivery month in platinum and 
palladium commences on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the first 
business day of the delivery month.

this issue tomorrow.

Index VaR and the Vega VaR status:
Because any modification of the VaR model has to be coded into the new 
version by IT,  the Index VaR model and the Vega VaR model are on the waiting 
list to get into  IT group's door.  Currently, they are struggling with the 
Credit Model.  Accord to Jonathan Le, they will implement the ""Prudency"" 
model after the ""Credit"" and before anything else.  So, it's uncertain when 
they can begin these two projects.

Credit Reserve Model status:
New version developed by IT is still in the debugging stage.  Two major 
difference exist between the new and old versions:
1)  Old version uses delta-gammar methodology, new version uses full 
evaluation.  IT group is not comfortable with their implementation of the 
""Spread option"" and ""Swaption"" evaluation.  I am working with them on it.
2) Insurance projects are new to the new version.  IT also wants our help too.

Only after the IT finishes the debugging process, could we start testing the 
new version with the current one.

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we 
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my 
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a 
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com 
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr. 
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may 
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw 
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with 
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have 
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's 
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient 
for me to borrow the book from you.

I have discovered the two sources of discrepancy in the ""transaction dollars"" 
on EOL, between my numbers and those of EOL. First, EOL records all index 
trades with the Henry Hub price (since the index price isn't, inadvertently, 
recorded with the trade, as I told you), whereas I went back and appended the 
contemporaneous index price to the trades. Second, EOL ignores all Basis 
trades in reporting transaction dollars, whereas I append a rough size to 
them of the ""price"" as the basis, times the quantity.

First of all, I would like to thank you for your hospitality. I learned a lot

2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I am
very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over
to the States  where we lack desperately technical talent.
Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney? 
The main determination I need from you is whether he can
function in a company like Enron. As any good academic
he sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in case
you don't have a PostScript reader on your system.

3. Christian Werner does some really neat things on
the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help
us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston
for a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike

Zimin and I talked briefly about the part-time work this morning. To recap;
I am willing to work 20 hours a week, however, I expressed my concern about
commuting every week. I asked if commuting once every two weeks (and work
out of Austin every other week) would be acceptable. As to the term of the
work, I suggested a 3-mo period (I have yet not talked to international
office which arranges work authorization using Curricular Practical Training
of which I have used up 9 months already), I might run into problems if I
ask for more. I also mentioned that I would do my best to accomodate your
preferences. We did not discuss any other details.

Let us meet early this afternoon. 

Here is the overview of the model:

1)The Ethylene margin collars are priced using Asian Spread option. 
  The forward curve and volatility curve are provided by the desk.
  The correlation between the Ethylene and Ethylene cost starts from the
  historical spot correlation 50% and grows with the maturity.

2) The overall 40MM payout cap is modeled sepereately.

    I fitted the historical spread ( 10 years data ) to a mean reverting model
   with stronger mean reverting strength on the floor side.  The model 
produces
   trajectories that are statistically simular to the historical data. 

  Then the expected payoff is computed through simulation. 

At the meeting we will discuss the assumptions and present the results.

modified to reflect the new coding system.  The procedures for its use are 
unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences.  One item to note: the 
form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use 
your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see 
http://hrweb.enron.com).  For electronically submitted expense reports, enter 
the same number on the receipt envelope.

The form is now available at the SAP website.  To access the form:

 From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com
 Choose one of the following paths:
 Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form

  Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu

  Click SAP Expense Report Form

You may print the spreadsheet for submission to Accounts Payable, or attach 
it to Notes for electronic submission.  Instructions are available at the 
website, on the same drop down box as the form.

1507,"Hello Vince, Stinson,

Thank you very much for hosting my visit at Enron. I had a
very pleasant time there, and I found the meetings very
informative.

As discussed during my visit at Enron, I am sending you below
a DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program
in place and rolling, and start the students working on it.
It took a while to find out what the appropriate process was
and how the letter should be structured. Sorry for the delay.

If I may, I'd like to visit Enron again, sometime in August,
to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize
the problems to look at. I'm in frequent contact with Giuseppe,
who is impressed by the environment there. We are trying to formulate
the research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest
to Enron.  The plan is this:

1) By August, Giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months
and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem
space.

2) I will work together with Giuseppe till August to formulate a set of
good problems of:
a) high practical importance
b) high innovation potential
c) serious scope.

3) I could  visit in August (say mid-August or so) to:
a) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback
b) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact
c) make sure we're on the same page regarding research strategy
and execution path.

I hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then, so
that I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his
doctoral work in this area.

I'm all excited about our collaboration. I am even thinking of
starting a research seminar at Stanford, specifically on these
research issues!

Talk to you soon.

This is my latest effort and I would appreciate your thoughts.  I know that
we haven't written together before so let me assure me that you will not
hurt my feelings by ""slashing away"" with a red pen.  I think that I have
put all the clay on the table for this piece of sculpture but it is still
pretty crude.  Help me ""refine"" the work to create something we can both be
very proud of.

By the way, I know you are extremely busy right now so don't feel pressured
to spend lots of time here.  Any guidance you can offer will be
appreciated.  I don't know what the editor's time schedule is but he asked
me to send him a draft on Monday.  You and I will still be able to edit the
manuscript but he will begin reading and editing it too.  I'll let you know
as soon as I have a final deadline.

not shown being charged for it.    That is Jason Sokolov.  He would like to
have access to Telerate.  If you could let me know how to get that for him.

The largest percent of the Telerate charges appear to be for Maureen
Raymond, who says that she does not use Telerate.  Could she be accessing
some data that she does not know is Telerate?  Please let me know.  If there
are individual accounts for Telerate the only one we need is for Jason 
Sokolov,
unless Maureen's charges are for something that she does not know is Telerate.
Tanya Tamarchenko does not need Telerate and she has the second largest
percentage of the charges.  Anyway, the only Telerate subscription we need is
for Jason Sokolov.

Reuters: (February charges:  $405.96)
No one in Research uses Reuters.  I believe most of the charges are for 
Hector 
Campos who used it when he was on the trading desk.  When he rotated into the 
Research group he did not need it any longer, but is still being billed for 
it.  Please 
remove from the Research Cost Center.

The following individuals are no longer with Enron or no longer with Research
and their accounts should be removed from the Research Cost Center.

Clayton Vernon  No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL 
and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center
Brad Amoine  No longer with Enron   Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core 
charges from the Research Cost Center
Shalesh Ganjoo No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM and LIM Core 
charges from the Research Cost Center

I hope this is not too confusing!
 
Please advise.

It was good to speak to you and Grant the other day.  Plese find attached a
block of 3 chapters that are basically the middle of the book. This should
give you an idea at the level it is pitched - although these are probably
some of the the most technical of the chapters. Julie who works for us will
be getting in contact with you soon to chase you up on your chapter!

I've asked Julie to have a chat to you about a couple of other things at
the same time. I hope this is OK with you. Julie and I will be making a
trip thru Houston around the third week of February to try and visit some
energy companies. It's mainly a fact finding trip to see what the energy
companies are doing and how we might be able to make use of our skills in a
commercial sense. Would you recommend any people we should talk too? Also
we will be running a course on energy derivatives in Houston at the end of
March following the success of the course in New York last year and want to
advertise this. Do you know of people who would be interested in such a
course?

We are currently putting together promotional material for the book - can
you please let Julie know how you and Grant would like to be advertised -
your official positions, etc.

Best regards, and I look forward to reading your chapter soon.

I made a few minor changes to the models...  I reckon these models can be 
checked in Houston now - the raw data is included (see attached spreadsheets) 
and all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed.  I 
became interested in how far DZCV and PLLU should be below RPI and whether 
this model is reflecting any reversion to the RPI level; I believe that the 
forecasts are accurately reflecting this.  Please see graphs below:



Both models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just 
copied the 2.3% number forward).  Because the auto-regressive error term is 
not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable 
confidence.  As I mentioned, I don't think we can really run this model more 
than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the 
next 3-4 months out with the long-term model.

Hope I can fix the long-term ones now with some new insight!

Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet
with you and other decision-makers at Enron. The meetings been very
productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more
clearly.

We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships 
(RA)
for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support
on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to
start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental
requirement.

Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can
do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having
pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early
September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September,
just before school starts.

I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous
e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford. Please,
let me know how you would like to proceed.

Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive 
collaboration
during the coming year and beyond.

better than me.

2. Trading & Risk Mgmt: Global Risk Mgmt oversight: John Sherrif in London

Background info. for Enron Research People.  OPNET is a simulation tool that 
many in the industry use to do capacity planning to IP based applications and 
services on a network.  Detail adenda will follow.

I wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for the time we had this
morning to discuss the performance engineering program at EBS. I think
you'll find that the value to Enron from the overall approach is quite
high. I have a much better picture now of some of the short term drivers
that need to be addressed as we move forward. As I work with you, I think
we'll quickly emerge with a clear picture of what needs to be done and when.

As soon as you confirm your schedule for April 6-8, I'll book my travel to
get to Houston. I've already put in a call to OPNET Technologies to have
them get a resource out to Houston on one of those days for a demonstration
and Q & A about the OPNET toolset.

I'll compose an agenda for us to use during that meeting in Houston and get
it out to you next week.

1540,"Following up on our discussions I implemented one method for creating forward 
forward curve
from implied vol curve. 
I sorted out 12 forward curves from an original forward vol curve, each of 12 
curves corresponding
to certain month. Then I fitted each of 12 curves with a function:

y=a+A/power(x+b, beta)

I figured out that when beta is from (0, .5) the above function is suitable 
for performing our bootstrapping
routine of deriving ff vols from implied, because:

y(x+t) * y(x+t) * (x+t) - y(x) * y(x) * tx> 0                  for all x, t.

(I have to double check on this again. Also when beta>0.5 there are some 
combinations of parameters a, A, b, beta
for which above equality holds). Even with restriction on beta this class of 
functions represents quite a variety of shapes.

Below you see the example of fitting as well as the example of ff vol curve 
constructed from implied vol curve for NG.

I'll try this for power as well.

Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are inviting Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would 
appreciate if you could
speak, together with Kevin and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is 
important for a group
of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to 
understand the big picture.

        While there is seasonal correlations in power, especially for Np-15

However, the same correlation structure with similar periodicity may not hold 
between Np-15 and, say, R1B (Neepool), though one would imagine that  
relationship would still be seasonal (summer/winter), with greater noise.

The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy
Price Risk has finally arrived. It has been four years
since the first edition was published. During this hiatus,
a lot has happened as risk management within the
rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as
a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich
compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative
group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.

The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that
risk management principles initially applied to a narrow
band of energy commodities can and should be applied
across a wide array of energy commodities including
electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in
capturing an international perspective on the various
challenges, which are not isolated to any one
continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy
introduction that effectively frames risk management
progress, advancements and innovations that started
in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the
natural gas and most recently expanding to the
electricity industry.

Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15
chapters, all of which include an introduction, which
minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from
a book written by a large number of authors. Other
improvements in this second edition include expanded
graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a
separate glossary, which provides the reader with
additional reference material.

In particular the chapter on energy options written by
Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the
reader with a concise explanation of option theory,
pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical
guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure
speculation. For the more advanced reader, the
chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince
Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is
particularly strong as it outlines the challenges
associated with the exotics and effectively documents
the latest methods used by leading practitioners in
pricing such instruments.

Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative
Contracts in the Energy Environment by three
consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written
summary which addresses the numerous tax related
issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial
Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see
EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax
information housed in one concise chapter is of great
value.

The second edition however is not without flaws. In
particular, it would have been useful to have more
information on the current challenges risk managers
are confronted with in the power industry including
latest advancements in volatility and correlation
estimation techniques. Additional attention could have
also been placed on the shortcomings of the current
market structure and methods in finding and applying
appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the
fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the
primary challenges.

In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy
Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the
prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the
new recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome
edition to any risk management library.

Enron Wholesale & Retail 
Business Hits Record Level 

Enron beat the Street as earnings climbed 31% thanks to online energy 
trading. Third quarter revenue soared 154% to $30 billion. Enron Pres/COO 
Jeffrey Skilling tells RadioWallStreet.com he believes crude oil prices will 
begin to fall in 2001. (ENE)

Energy Trading, EnronOnline Help Enron Top 3rd Quarter Estimates
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/17/2000
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- After once again helping Enron Corp. (ENE) to top Wall 
Street's expectations, the importance of Enron's energy trading operations 
was further cemented in the third quarter. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings rose 31% to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, 
from $223 million, or 27 cents a share, before items, a year ago. 
Third-quarter revenue rose 154% to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
In the year-ago period, Enron's net income was $290 million, or 35 cents a 
share, after a gain of $345 million, or 44 cents a share, on the sale of its 
stake in Enron Oil & Gas Co. (EOG), and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents 
a share, on its MTBE asset. 
According to First Call/Thomson Financial, analysts were expecting Enron to 
earn 32 cents a share in the latest third quarter. 
The key driver of the company's performance was its wholesale business, which 
includes EnronOnline and commodity sales, and which has transformed Enron 
from a gas pipeline company to the world's largest energy trader. 
In the third quarter, the wholesale business just had ""a stunning quarter,"" 
said Enron President Jeff Skilling. 
Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services unit, which 
includes EnronOnline and commodity sales, more than doubled to $28.15 billion 
from $11.06 billion. 
Income before interest, minority interest and taxes, or IBIT, in the third 
quarter rose 66% to $627 million from $378 million a year ago. 
During the latest period, physical deliveries of energy commodities grew 64% 
to 53.5 trillion British thermal units, Enron said. 
EnronOnline, the company's Internet-based transaction system, is driving the 
growth of the wholesale segment, said Raymond Niles, an analyst at Salomon 
Smith Barney. 
Currently, more than 60% of the Enron's wholesale business occurs through 
EnronOnline. As of Oct. 11, EnronOnline had executed more than 350,000 
transactions online, totaling $183 billion of gross value since its inception 
in late 1999. 
EnronOnline, which initially bought and sold natural gas, electricity, 
petrochemicals, and bandwidth, has expanded to other commodity areas such as 
metals and pulp and paper. 
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin supports Enron's decision to expand to 
other commodities. ""The only limit (to expanding to other commodities) is 
intellectual capital,"" Feygin said. 
He estimates that the North American steel business is a $35 billion 
business, while pulp and paper is about $150 billion. 

At least part of the success that Enron had during the third quarter was the 
result of price volatility in California's deregulated energy market. 
However, the company wouldn't specify what it earned in the state. 
During the third quarter, utilities in the Golden State paid near-record 
rates for electricity as higher demand pushed the power grid to the brink. 
""The uncertainty and the volatility that we have been seeing in the 
electricity and the gas market has been beneficial to Enron,"" said Enron's 
Skilling. 
California's situation is rather unique, he said. Skilling expects 
Californian electricity markets will improve as supply and demand fall into 
balance and other technical market questions are resolved. 
Although Enron posted strong earnings across the board, it is getting clearer 
that the company will look to divest itself of some of its international 
assets. 
According to a source familiar with the company, Enron recently completed an 
analysis of its assets with the intent of identifying underperforming assets 
and improving capital efficiency. As a result of the analysis, some assets 
were marked for sale. 
Skilling admitted the company would like to monetize some of its 
international assets, but he wouldn't say which assets are on the auction 
block. 
However, it is unlikely Enron will sell its international gas pipelines 
because the assets receive a solid rate of return, Skilling said. 
One asset that could be divested is Enron's Dabhol Power Project in 
Maharashtra, India, said analysts. Other power plants in Italy and Turkey 
also seem like logical candidates for sale. 
""I think it makes a lot of sense for Enron,"" said Salomon's Niles. ""Enron is 
moving into markets where they are relying on intellectual capital rather 
than physical capital,"" he said. Following this logic, assets such as the 
India power plant don't make as much sense as they once did. 
In some cases, the international assets are in countries that didn't open to 
competition as expected, explained Zach Wagner, an analyst at Edward Jones. 
Since deregulation has been fueling Enron's growth, it only makes sense that 
the company concentrate on open markets. 
Furthermore, Wagner believes the money Enron will raise in the asset sales 
could be re-deployed to fund projects such as the company's venture with 
Blockbuster Inc. (BBI) to provide movies on demand via high-speed telephone 
lines.

",WAYNE-DALTON,281-821-8572,
1602,"Herewith a few ideas for the October meeting in London, some of them
after checking with Paul Portney and with Pankaj. I offer these very, very
preliminary thoughts just to start you thinking - do you want your UK
colleagues on the program; do we want some ancillary events? After getting
your views on questions such as these, I can make more definite suggestions.
I certainly think that we should convene a few hours before the opening
dinner so that the advisors can have a tour of the building and the
facilities. Also, I am hoping that Steve will leave some time on this trip
for a tour of the new BA headquarters - very innovative.
We should consider doing something on the global warming question from the
viewpoint of the Europeans. Start with three recommendations on the political
side that Paul received from David Victor of the Council on Foreign Relations
(characterized as ""a VERY smart guy on climate""):
Tony Brenton (Deputy chief of mission, UK embassy in DC.  Has been on UK
climate delegations for a decade; smart and lively; pragmatic; insightful).
Bo Kjellen (Swedish head of delegation; knows European politics inside out;
big figure in Europe).
Tubiana, Laurence (Conseil d'Analyse Economique, France; knows the issue and
can speak to French position, but may not have the gravitas of Kjellen or
Brenton).
Among other ideas (I have winnowed out several) is a guy named Liam
Salter at Climate Network Europe. Brussels based, but relatively junior. Paul
also recommends a woman by the name of Laurence Tubiana, an economist in the
French government's equivalent of the CEA; she has a reputation as a good
presenter and a good economist.
WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THESE FOLKS OUT WITH YOUR LONDON PEOPLE, AND GET
ADDITIONAL NAMES FROM THEM. THE GOAL IS TO GIVE ALL OF US A PERSPECTIVE ON
THE EUROPEAN VIEW ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - UNLESS YOU THINK THAT NOT A
USEFUL TOPIC.
I turn now to Pankaj's suggestion, which I transmit verbatim: ""I remember
promising to scout around and see if there were a European whom it would be
interesting to invite to talk to the Enron International Advisory Council
about the (non) convergence of governance structures in Europe, particularly
on the Continent, to the U.S. model.  I got the following names from Jay
Lorsch (apparently all members of the committee steering a multifaculty
Harvard business School project on governance in comparative perspective) as
possibilities.  Jay suggested that Sihler would be best (former CEO of
Henkel, very senior),  Peter's second best (apparently, chairman of Amsterdam
Stock Exchange now) and Smith - formerly Managing partner at Price Waterhouse
Coopers - would be the most junior of the three.  I don't personally know any
of the three.""
Now some ideas of my own, again acting on the assumption that we want a
two-way educational dialogue - to give your folks in London and Europe a
run-down on the situation in the US, and the US contingent a better
understanding of how European policymakers view the issues we all face.
1.Bill Kristol on the US political scene, in which there is great
interest here, and great misunderstanding of the Bush administration. We
might also consider inviting Larry Lindsey or some other Bush person if
allowed to do so.
2. Someone on the European view on global warming (see suggestions above).
3. Energy regulation in the UK. Callum McCarthy.
4. Economic outlook. Gavyn Davies (usual talk).
5. What went wrong in California (great interest in that over here) and
how to fix it. Steve could do this, or you could invite Bill Hogan (just
joking) or the chairman of FERC if we are allowed to pay his way.
6. Motivating people in a multinational, multicultural organization. If
this is of interest, I can get recommendations for speakers.
7. I would be inclined to add a high-level speaker on the state of
US-UK-European relations, perhaps as a dinner speaker. Between Gavyn and me,
we might be able to get Chancellor Gordon Brown, a very interesting guy, and
the inventor of the ""climate change levy"" that is driving industry in this
country nuts.
Please look this over. Steve and I have to get together, preferably with
Ken, which leads me to suggest Aspen during the Institute's energy forum,
which I understand Ken will be attending. But if that is not feasible, Steve
and I can work out a date for a preliminary meeting, followed up by one with
Ken at his convenience.

1609,"The Hearings
The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like 
environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility 
witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E 
witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices 
since restructuring started in 1998.
Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for 
investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g., 
dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and 
parent's use of that cash for investment activities).  
Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the 
utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from 
parent, bankruptcy).
The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward 
PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings 
progress.
Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by 
Edison witness.
Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to 
issue its decision on Thursday.
At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed 
the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general 
ratemaking authority.

Outside the Hearing
Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management 
continue.
Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities 
inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain 
some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with 
utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any 
rate increases.
Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission 
absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor 
follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of 
the state speech on the 8th.",,,PG&E ALJ Commission the Commission/Administration

1612,"Once again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity 
legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other 
interested parties including industry segments, public power and state 
regulators.  The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve 
Largent and Chip Pickering.

After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an 
agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an 
electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package 
that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next 
week.  Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the 
discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine 
whether to proceed further.  There is a general perception that committee 
leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in 
the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported 
legislation.

In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained 
over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines.  As the drafts 
progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language 
that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and 
federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action 
in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case.

A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together 
a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the 
understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to 
our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal 
siting.  However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant 
interest groups not willing to go along.  Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to 
link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO.

There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection 
and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the 
details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the 
minimalist package.

There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks 
floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have 
made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market 
rates.  Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others.

As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up 
occurs.  In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and 
other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will 
take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday.  That package will 
have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and 
reformulated gasoline.  Details to follow once legislative language is 
released.","Tom DeLay Steve

a. The key thing that we accomplished was to put together a Due Diligence

3. Continuing -

Yes.  Although the WG efforts have to focus on improving the overall culture

1623,"On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not ""get to the root of the problem"" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as ""different,"" with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers (""TPs"") that control transmission, generation and load.  ""As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.""  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
""enormous"" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs (""OATT"") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, ""Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit."")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled ""business practices,"" especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  ""As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff.""  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on ""passively"" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility (""VIU"") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
""problem area"" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is ""up to individual Managers discretion.""  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

Good to see you in New York last week at the Guggenheim -- I enjoyed your 
company at the dinner.  Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush 
Energy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from 
Lisa Jacobson's and my perspective.  Many of the recommendations in the 
Energy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve.  
However, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate 
opportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of 
the plan beneficial to Enron.
 
Short-term opportunities

$2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies:  There may be 
opportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for 
technologies such as NOx Tech.  While the bulk of this money could take 
several years to approve, there is ""clean coal"" program money available now 
for FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money.   I have 
already discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we 
have good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as 
they see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money 
because we are serious about moving technologies to market.   

Climate Change R&D:  Any financial support the government puts toward climate 
change R&D could likely also be utilized for new generation/control 
technologies, but this would be a longer-term opportunity.

New Source Review (NSR) Reforms -  NSR has been an obstacle to constructing 
new generation, but also a huge thorn in the side of big coal-using utilities 
who would like to make modifications to keep grandfathered plants alive as 
long as possible.  The Clinton/Browner EPA brought major enforcement lawsuits 
against a number (Southern, TVA, AEP, Cinergy) and a few have settled 
(Cinergy, TECO). The Bush Energy Plan asks the EPA and Justice Dept. to look 
at 1) possible changes to the NSR enforcement lawsuits and 2) longer term 
changes to NSR regulation -- all in the name of bringing more energy supply 
on line.  The utilities are mounting very aggressive lobbying efforts to 
change NSR.

A DOJ decision on the enforcement could be forthcoming in the short term 
(summer 2001).  In the big picture for Enron, letting the big, coal-using 
utilities off the hook would not be the best outcome -- enforcement relief 
only holds benefits for the incumbents and not new entrants in the power 
development market.   But if it happens, we'll make sure the EGM folks have 
good advance warning so that they can take advantage of any coal trading or 
technology plays that they might find as a result from these utilities moving 
forward with plant modifications or capacity increases.

Any NSR regulatory changes will be fought over the longer-term (with 
resistance from environmentalists), and could also likely be addressed in the 
multipollutant debate -- see below.

Long Term Opportunities/Advocacy

Multipollutant legislation -  A regulatory program that all at once 
streamlines regulation of NOx, SO2 and mercury as well as provides relief 
from NSR requirements could be extremely beneficial for EGM's emissions 
trading and technology businesses (as well as a number of other Enron 
businesses).   Nationwide trading for these pollutants would open up markets 
and create liquidity far beyond the current programs.   Regulatory certainly 
for generators seeking to upgrade, expand and improve efficiency at power 
plants could provide incentives for technology and risk management services.

Our Environmental Strategies group has developed a multipollutant plan that 
achieves a number of goals for Enron, including nationwide cap-and-trade for 
3 (or even 4, if CO2 is included) pollutants in a way that provides 
incentives for new technologies, promotes fuel diversity, and has economic 
safeguards in place.   We've structured it to have multiple benefits to 
Enron, and we are working on getting key Administration and congressional 
officials to adopt our ideas.   We're making progress, but expect this debate 
to go on for at least a few years.

Here are some excerpts from recent slides summarizing our plan, if you're 
interested.



Please let us know if you have any questions - we are happy to work with you 
and anyone in EGM to take advantage of opportunities in these environmental 
proposals.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company Welcomes FERC Report
San Francisco - Pacific Gas and Electric Company issued the following 
statement on the report issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(FERC) today:
""Pacific Gas and Electric Company is pleased that FERC has used its authority 
to give California many of the tools we need to fix the wholesale electricity 
markets in this state. We agree with Chairman Hoecker and other FERC 
commissioners that this report is a sound beginning to the process of 
repairing the marketplace, but that more actions will need to be taken, at 
both the state and federal level, before the goal of a working, competitive 
energy market can be realized in California. 
""The new bid framework the Commission ordered represents a creative attempt 
to fix the market and moderate prices, while still allowing competition to 
evolve. Our hope is that this new framework will be successful in moderating 
electricity prices. 
""While the report does not find evidence of market power abuse in California 
this summer, FERC does provide for potential refunds, should abuse be 
discovered, effective as of the beginning of October 2000. 
""We are very pleased with the opportunity the Commission has given us to 
review and comment upon this report, and look forward to providing our 
comments on November 9, and throughout this proceeding.""
The FERC action comes one day after Pacific Gas and Electric Company made an 
unprecedented $790 million payment to the Power Exchange for wholesale 
electricity costs for the single month of August 2000. 
""The wholesale electric market in California is clearly broken,"" said Gordon 
R. Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company. ""We cannot continue to borrow money to pay excessive wholesale power 
prices, which will hit our customers sooner or later. We welcome thoughtful 
intervention to repair the market.""

Energy, Costs and Availability Committee moments ago on a party line
vote.  There were clarifying amendments taken which we will send out as
soon as they become available.

Supporters included: organized labor, Sierra Club, municipal utilities,
PCL, TURN, UCAN, AARP, Gray Panthers, Foundation for Consumer and
Taxpayer Rights.  IEP also testified in support of the bill but did
request amendments to clarify the eminent domain provisions.  The only
opposition came from a single private citizen.

Committee Chair Rod Wright  pointed out that up until recently LADWP had
among the highest rates in the state and that rates in New York are even
higher.  Consequently, he believes that the purpose of the PPA is to
ensure reliability, not to lower rates and that those who claim rates
will go down with the PPA will be sorely disappointed.  Assemblyman
Wright also highlighted the tremendous amount of private capital
currently entering the state and suggested that this bill must not be
used to supplant this capital.  He also implied that a state bureaucrat
must not run the PPA.

According to State Treasurer Phil Angelides who drafted the bill, the
intent of the state would be to provide anywhere between 5,000 to 7,500
in new capacity or conservation measures with $5 billion in bonds.  He
also indicated that the state would sell its power at cost based rates
which are specified in the amendments.

"
1648,"Earlier today, the New York Public Service Commission released a 122 page 
draft report prepared by its staff evaluating the NYISO. The report concludes 
that the ISO must pursue a wide range of operational reforms and other 
consumer safeguards to ""ensure a more efficient and stable electric market 
that will better protect consumers from dramatic price increases."" The report 
culminates a months-long investigation begun by the PSC last summer in 
response to problems and price run-ups in the wholesale market.

The major recommendations in the Report, some of which have already surfaced 
in recent ISO Committee meetings, would be devastating to a competitive 
wholesale market and would largely reregulate prices in New York. They 
include the following (taken directly from the PSC's Press Release):

Reforming rules and procedures to improve the efficiency of the market and 
minimize opportunities for market manipulation, or ""gaming,"" by owners of 
electricity generating facilities;
Initiating a $150 per megawatt hour price cap on generators to maintain 
reasonable market clearing prices;
Creating a ""circuit-breaker"" mechanism that will prevent market power abuses 
at levels below $150/MWH;
Lowering price thresholds significantly to allow the NYISO to step in more 
quickly to investigate and mitigate price spikes;
Granting the NYISO retroactive refund authority to return to consumers gains 
that generators improperly derive from market power abuse; and,
Creating a strong deterrent against price abuses by penalizing generators who 
repeatedly use improper tactics to raise prices above competitive levels.

The NYPSC, of course, has no legal authority to impose any of these 
recommendations. However, they are likely to muster support from the 
Transmission Owners, governmental entities and loads, that usually control 
enough votes to just  pass a motion at an ISO Committee. This will set up a 
confrontation with the ISO Board, which is walking a delicate tightrope 
between maintaining its independence and supporting a competitive wholesale 
market on the one hand, and dealing with the politics of a hostile 
Administration in New York. Last summer, as you may recall, the Board 
rejected the $1000 bid cap pushed through by the PSC, voting instead for a 
$1300 cap. That action was set aside by FERC, which reimposed the $1,000 
level and then made it applicable in New England as well so that there would 
be consistency among the three Northeast ISOs (PJM already had the $1,000 
cap.) 

Thus, whether NY follows the lead of California is likely to be determined by 
FERC, and it will have to carefully consider the consistency concerns it 
raised last summer in ultimately deciding whether it's OK for New York to set 
price caps below its neighboring ISOs.

numbers aren't that far off the numbers that were noted on us, which leads me 
to believe the competitors numbers a little more. Look at the spreadsheet 
below.  While our Corp spending was small, over we spent almost $800,000 as 
Enron in whole and that is probably what they were noting.  (I subtracted 
Axurix out -  that is why the number dropped from 1.1 Million).

1654,"I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded 
today (8/24) in San Diego.  Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch 
and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.  Administrative Law 
Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative 
hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into 
the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale 
markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market 
structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this 
session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory 
intervention in the market.

Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was 
present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold 
hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference 
announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation 
of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund 
authority.

The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by 
Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any 
questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No 
questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of 
academics were comprised of:

1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley
2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard
3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)
4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees
5.  Dr. Gene Coyle
6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne

The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any 
institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be 
to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too 
high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of 
blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The 
concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the 
mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of 
Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of 
his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was 
some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I 
think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified 
concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas 
costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage 
utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of 
real-time market power. 

Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to 
promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain 
system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase 
ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.  
The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution 
utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This 
included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider 
role.  

Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible 
without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be 
support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a 
good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand 
response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to 
the extent currently experienced in San Diego.

Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN 
and ORA.  

While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not 
generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, 
today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.

SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in 
excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their 
inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR 
proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the 
utility to be more responsible with their purchases.

UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate 
caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I 
customers are experience difficulties as well.  

TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking 
contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of 
assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been 
divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify 
the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.

Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current 
requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN 
disagreed.

1655,"I talked  with Jamie  Rosenfeld,  the   CERA  SVP     and he  said Dan Yergin 
is 
very much interested in this  type of   advocacy  and  right now is highly 
sought out by TV  and   print media  on these  same   issues which are of 
concern  to Enron -- on  supply  security,  managing  price volatility  and 
supply  turmoil, avoiding regulatory  backlash,  and promoting just  letting 
the  market  work .  Beyond   Dan  taking   media  referrals  and  an Op  Ed 
--  they suggested   several more  ideas.  

1.  November  1-2  is  CERA's Houston Conference Roundtable.  The  day 
before  the Conference Enron  could host  a special  session,  a top 100  
Leadership Circle, or  a special dinner  and   dinnner /speaker  to which key 
media  would  be  invited.  Enron  could  invite  special  attendees  like  
PUC, NARUC  ,  Congressional  types  and other Opiniion Leaders  to attend.  
We  would   get the  shadow  benefit  of   1500-2000  attendees  and media  
in town  for the  Roundtable  the next  day.  

2.
In concert with the  recent  release  of   the   CERA  Electric Power  Trends 
publication,  CERA  would quickly  prepare  a  similar  short  version of  a 
Natural  Gas Trends publication (much is on the shelf   already)  and  
Enron   could  purchase  bulk   copies of  each .  We  could  use a  custom  
cover letter  from  Ken and/or Jeff   as the opportunity  to  inform    PUC  
chairs, key  Members  of  Congress,  the  two  Presidential  campaigns' 
leadership  and other Opinion leaders about  issues of importance  to Enron  
and its   businesses  -- this merges nicely  with
the  pro  energy  choice, pro markets, pro deregulation  messages contained 
in the  text and  graphics of  Cera's  Trends  publications.

3.
Enron  could   sponsor     a  10 minute  and  or even  a 30- 40 minute   
Energy  Security  themed  multi media  presentation  full of  intellectual 
content  addressing the  key  electricity  and gas  reliability  and pro 
market forces  messages  Enron is  espousing .We would   advise  target 
audiences in  a  letter  as to how to access  the show on the Cera  media  
center  on their  web site  and  Cera  could  do this in concert with   
EBS.   Or  it   could  be  an add- on  to  the  Trends  publication/ letter  
send  out.  In any case  the multi media message  gets the  advantage of  
exposure  to  the 10 000  eyeballs  the  CERA  site   already offers. 

4.   In Feb  CERA  has  its  Houston Executive  Conference.  If  we have  a  
rough  winter  that  could  be  great timing
for  Enron  to  use this  as a Problem Solving and Policy Setting Forum  for 
a  high level   'how  to'  Workshop --and/or   invite  in  some  natural  gas 
and electricity  end  users  and/or  gas distributor speakers  from  the   
buy side that  ""did it  right""  and  can  talk  about   how they  hedged  or  
set  up their  portfolios    to make it  successfully through a  tough  
winter market.  Security  analyst speakers talking  about   doing it the  
right  way  would also be  useful.

My   thought  is  that   Item   2.    sending  the  Trends  publications   
coupled with   brief  multi media  messaging
(from  Item 3) might  give us the bigger   impact  faster and more  
targeted   than  the others.  

 Do any of  these  appeal   to  you  ?

I have not talked directly with Coastal about their specific approach, but am 
aware of efforts to find tax relief for conversion of MTBE facilities to 
alkalytes.   This is also an option that has been discussed in the OFA and 
MTBE Producer groups.   It certainly could be a viable ""fallback"" position to 
stranded cost recovery.

However, Coastal is very differently situated than Enron in terms of stranded 
costs or liability protection.   Refiners can't make as good a case for 
stranded costs as the merchant producers of MTBE who developed unique 
facilites directly in response to the Clean Air Act oxygenate mandate.   On 
liability protection, refiners and marketers are more directly responsible 
for groundwater contamination with MTBE because they have the leaking tanks 
-- so they have what could be characterized as ""contributory negligence"", 
where MTBE producers do not.

I agree with Steve Kean's response -- going after liability protection is 
probably going to be more viable than finding stranded costs.   We will keep 
pressing both issues, and distinguishing ourselves as one of the ""good 
actors"" that responded to the Clean Air Act to produce MTBE and has not 
contributed to gasoline spills.

 In terms of conversion to alkalytes, one of the complicating factors is the 
""tax"" angle.   In all the current legislative efforts in the House and 
Senate, the sponsors are avoiding inclusion of tax provisions so that the 
bills do not have to go through review by the separate tax committees, which 
would delay the legislation probably to its demise.   Passing separate tax 
legislation that contains alkalyte conversion provisions may also be 
difficult -- in general, it will be hard for Congress to pass even modest tax 
legislation this year.   

If this emerges as a viable strategy, however, I think it is worth 
consideration.   I will talk with Coastal to see what their strategy is and 
follow up with you and Jim Prentice to see if it's appropriate to pursue.

She said she had tapped into the following for potential candidates:
1. Ad placed in Fire Chief Magazine and on Firechief.com web page.
2. Announcement sent to all HFD employees.
3. Utilized Municipal Yellow pages (a who's who in the leading city and 
county governments and local authorities), targeting fire department 
personnel in the top 18 cities (based on population).

As a result of her efforts, 18 resumes have been received and were forwarded 
to me. However, when I accessed the firechief.com web page this weekend I 
could not find the advertisement (I have asked her to check on this ASAP). 
Moreover, surfing various web pages/sites related to fire 
departments/associations, I was very impressed by the International Fire 
Chiefs web page (especially compared to the Fire Chief web page) and 
suggested to Jan as well as Dennis Thompson (see below) that we try to 
advertise there as well.

As a result of my ""surfing the net"", I have compiled a list of decorated fire 
chiefs as well as recognized fire chief leaders on various fire related 
boards and committees. While these individuals may not fit into the top 18 
cities in terms of population, I do not believe we should narrow our search 
to this criteria. I believe what we are looking for here is an outstanding 
leader with a track record of implementing change and cooperation within the 
different divisions in the fire department.

met with him today at 11am. He expects to have an answer on the legal issue 
(whether I would be excluded from public access) sometime today and the list

- only one Fire Chief was from outside (Swartout) and it was a disaster (he 
lasted 3 1/2 months)
- Acting Fire Chief, Connealy, really wants the job

2. Current state of the fire department
- fire prevention (considered critical by TriData) wasn't given the attention 
needed by Tyra
- personnel fractioned - union partly to blame
- communication broken down
- low moral
- department underfunded

1664,"Not a bad wire story - relevant for our conference call later today. Reuters 
in London called me at breakfast yesterday, then Mark gave them some on the 
record comments later. See quote. I had pointed them at lessons to be learnt 
in relation to Spain and Netherlands, and you will see there are a couple of 
mentions of those countries (though only in context of interconnection 
capacity) towards the end of the piece. I think other relevant lessons would 
be related to perils of allowing retail and wholesale (esp. pools for 
residual capacity) markets to be divorced in regulatory terms one from the 
other. Difference from California, however, is that the divorce in Spain and 
Netherlands works currently to detriment of new entrants and to the benefit 
of vertically integrated incumbents.

1665,"Recent information indicates that the State of Michigan and possibly other 
state and industrial parties who have challenged the EPA's NOx SIP Call 
regulation in court -- and lost -- will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme 
Court this September.

As you may recall, on June 22, the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, 
upheld the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulations, lifted the stay on the 
regulations, and mandated that states move forward with developing and 
submitting State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by the end of October 2000.   

States that must now develop SIPs include:  Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, 
District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West 
Virginia, Wisconsin  (Georgia, Missouri & Wisconsin were excluded from the 
regulation by the Appeals Court in its original decision, but will eventually 
be re-included in the SIP process)

Impact of a Supreme Court Appeal:

Parties appealing the case to the Supreme Court will likely ask for a stay of 
the EPA requirement for states to submit SIPs until the case is finally 
decided.    It is not certain whether or not a stay would be granted by the 
Court.  An appeal can not be filed until the Court returns at the beginning 
of October, and a decision on a stay might not come until after the October 
30 SIP deadline, so it many states might proceed with developing their SIP 
anyway.   States who choose to not develop a SIP and assume that a stay will 
be granted will be taking the risk that they miss the October 30 SIP deadline 
and EPA imposes its own Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) -- if the stay is 
not granted, the state would have to live with the federal requirements for 
NOx reductions in its state.

Another impact is that the May 2003 deadline for implementation of the rule 
-- and compliance by emitting sources -- may also be delayed if the Supreme 
Court imposes a stay on the regulations and accepts the case on appeal.   If 
the case is accepted, a decision would not likely be reached until June 2001, 
which would likely delay a compliance deadline until 2004.

We will keep you posted as this situation develops.  Right now, Environmental 
Strategies is continuing to work in the states that are developing SIPs, to 
ensure that the states treat new generation fairly and that market-based 
solutions to NOx reduction are employed so that trading and other 
opportunities for Enron businesses will be maximized.

FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River 
Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the 
natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were 
happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. 
""The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is 
something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,"" but the 
""precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword,"" warned 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although 
she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC 
""should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action."" 
Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action 
expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the 
""extraordinary regulatory treatment"" that the Commission gave it. Critics 
claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler 
Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she 
noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. 
""...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in 
the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how 
our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing 
electric generation in California this summer,"" Breathitt said. If anything, 
she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even 
worse than it is. 
There should have been a ""fuller airing of this issue"" at FERC before the 
project was certificated, she noted. ""It would be counterproductive for this

1677,"? The extraordinary session is expected to close early next week, after the 
governor has signed SB 28X, a power plant siting bill.  Yesterday, the 
governor signed bond financing bill SB 31X.  Once the extraordinary session 
is closed, a new extraordinary session is expected to be opened immediately.  
However, sources report that no one is certain if the bills from this session 
will have the same numbers in the next session.  The legislature reportedly 
is trying to arrange so that the bills will not have to be heard again in 
committee.

? The MOU still does not have a sponsor.  Governor Davis hopes to reach a 
deal with Sempra for the state to purchase San Diego Gas and Electric's 
transmission assets.  He reportedly feels that by having deals in place with 
SoCal and SDG&E, enough momentum might be added to push the MOU through the 
legislature.  He then could go to the bankruptcy court and propose adding 
PG&E's assets, since he would have two of the three pieces in place.  The 
validity of this logic seems questionable at best.  Sources are skeptical 
that adding SDG&E to the MOU would increase the chances of the deal going 
through the legislature.  Also, the governor has claimed to be close to 
having a deal with SDG&E for several weeks, but such a deal has not yet been 
finalized.  The governor stated that he will have a sponsor for the MOU by 
next week when the bill will be introduced.  The MOU might be introduced in 
the legislature, then amended to indicate a lesser amount for the 
transmission asset purchase.  This still would not assure passage since so 
many legislators reportedly are against the MOU.

? The windfall profits tax bill has not been set for hearing on the Assemble 
floor.  

? State Legislature, Elizabeth Hill, published a report earlier this week 
regarding an analysis of state revenues.  The report stated that revenues for 
this year would be $3.4B less that was expected in January 2001, not 
including electricity costs.  She predicts that ongoing state programs will 
have to be cut by approximately $1.7B.

? Moody's has put California's credit rating under review for another 
downgrade.  Sources report that Moody's, S&P, and MBIA have all informed 
California that ""the only way the state will improve its credit rating and

Here are my thoughts.  Add / delete any

The state has properly identified (finally) the fundamental problem in 
California - the shortage of supply in a market with growing demand.  
Recognizing the core problem is at least half of the battle.
But rather than remove the current roadblocks to increased generation and 
transmission investment, California appears to be choosing to own and operate 
generation and transmission.
The best solution is to have the state allow private companies to site new 
generation.
Given government's other large scale participation into public power - TVA, 
BPA, NYPA - it is highly unlikely that trying to set up a state agency to do 
something that private capital is willing and able to do is rational or in 
the public interest.
Issuing debt costs consumers money and takes away capital from other 
important issues - new roads and new schools.
We would be willing to work with the Legislature to help craft a bill that 
gets more supply in California quickly, efficiently, and in an 
environmentally sound manner, but this draft only creates more bureaucracy.  ",Jeff,,BPA NYPA Legislature

1696,"Senate approves Edison rescue deal, Assembly measure stalled
By Jennifer Coleman 
Associated Press Writer 
SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state Senate approved a bill that significantly alters the plan negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis to help the struggling utility Southern California Edison. 
The bill approved Friday, authored by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco and Byron Sher, lets Edison issue $2.5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record-high levels in the last year. 
""I believe it's a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out of the business of buying electricity ... and to bring this entity to creditworthiness,"" said Polanco, D-Los Angeles. 
Approved 22-17, the bill now goes to the Assembly. The Assembly adjourned Friday night without voting on a similar measure. 
The Polanco-Sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by Edison, which says it won't help the company escape bankruptcy. 
Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its estimated $3.5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay skyrocketing wholesale power prices. 
Under the plan by Polanco, and Sher, of Stanford, the state has a five-year option to buy Edison's grid. 
That, said Republican Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, gives Edison a bailout it ""neither needs nor deserves. 
""I am tired of this projection of Edison as a victim. They have their legion of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn't support deregulation,"" Johnson said during floor debate. ""The idea of Edison as the victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers. Edison paid their lobbyists bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation."" 
During the 1995-1996 deliberations that led to deregulation, Edison officials helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican. 
Lawmakers are set to go on summer break Friday night until Aug. 20, a schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the Memorandum of Understanding between Davis and Edison. That says the Legislature must approve the deal by Aug. 15. 
""It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess,"" Davis said Friday. 
For that to happen, either the Senate bill or a proposal by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has to reach Davis. 
""I have problems with both bills,"" Davis said. ""I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house."" 
The Keeley-Hertzberg plan trims at least $300 million from the governor's offer. It also allows Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by Edison ratepayers over 10 years. 
The plan also attempts to increase the state's use of ""green"" energy resources and allow Edison customers to opt for cheaper direct-access energy service. 
The Assembly didn't vote on the Keeley bill Friday, because Hertzberg is considering forming a working group with the Senate and the administration to ""iron out the bills' differences,"" said Hertzberg's spokesman Paul Hefner. 
Davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer break to devise a compromise by the Aug. 15 deadline. 
""I don't want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry about it on Aug. 20 because I know we're going to have reapportionment and other major issues to deal with in that last month,"" the governor said.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small 
customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal 
that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the 
MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  
The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not 
yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting 
attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is 
attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on 
the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by 
customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the 
generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, 
investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts 
and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the 
bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong 
possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX 
labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to 
include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate 
has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds 
to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. 
AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a ""modified MOU.""  
Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their ""modified"" 
MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an ""informational"" hearing on the bill tomorrow 
(Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, 
with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on 
Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, 
July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get 
resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional 
comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie 
Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in 
Sacramento.

California Stiffs Gore's Hatchet Men  
California's state controller, Democrat Kathleen Connell,  says she won't sign any checks for those $30,000-a-month Gore hatchet men hired  by bumbling Gov. Gray Davis to try to blame others for the state's energy  fiasco.  
""I would like assurance that their work is directly related to solving  California's energy crisis and not the political strategy that [Mark] Fabiani  and [Chris] Lehane have built a reputation for through their work at the White  House,"" Connell said, Fox News reported today.  
Connell says she supports a lawsuit filed Monday in Sacramento by Lewis  Uhler, president of National Tax Limitation Committee, to block ""consultant""  fees to the two former advisers to failed presidential candidate Al Gore.  
""They have a conflict of interest that may be terminal to their employment,""  Uhler said. ""These are clearly not electricity experts. Their background  suggests they have been hired to be damage control folks for a beleaguered  governor.""",Gore Kathleen Connell Gray Davis [Chris] Lehane Connell Lewis  Uhler Al Gore Uhler,"30,000-a",Hatchet Men Fox News National Tax Limitation Committee

1707,"North America's integrated electricity market requires cooperation on
environmental policies

Commission for Environmental Cooperation releases working paper on North
America's electricity market

Montreal, 27 November 2001 -- The North American Commission for
Environmental Cooperation (CEC) is releasing a working paper
highlighting the trend towards increasing trade, competition and
cross-border investment in electricity between Canada, Mexico and the
United States. 

It is hoped that the working paper, Environmental Challenges and
Opportunities in the Evolving North American Electricity Market, will
stimulate public discussion around a CEC symposium of the same title
about the need to coordinate environmental policies trinationally as a
North America-wide electricity market develops. The CEC symposium will
take place in San Diego on 29-30 November, and will bring together
leading experts from industry, academia, NGOs and the governments of
Canada, Mexico and the United States to consider the impact of the
evolving continental electricity market on human health and the
environment.

""Our goal [with the working paper and the symposium] is to highlight key
environmental issues that must be addressed as the electricity markets
in North America become more and more integrated,"" said Janine Ferretti,
executive director of the CEC. ""We want to stimulate discussion around
the important policy questions being raised so that countries can
cooperate in their approach to energy and the environment.""

The CEC, an international organization created under an environmental
side agreement to NAFTA known as the North American Agreement on
Environmental Cooperation, was established to address regional
environmental concerns, help prevent potential trade and environmental
conflicts, and promote the effective enforcement of environmental law. 

The CEC Secretariat believes that greater North American cooperation on
environmental policies regarding the continental electricity market is
necessary to:

*  protect air quality and mitigate climate change,
*  minimize the possibility of environment-based trade disputes,
*  ensure a dependable supply of reasonably priced electricity across
North America
*  avoid creation of pollution havens, and
*  ensure local and national environmental measures remain effective.

The Changing Market

The working paper profiles the rapid changing North American electricity
market. For example, in 2001, the US is projected to export 13.1
thousand gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity to Canada and Mexico. By
2007, this number is projected to grow to 16.9 thousand GWh of
electricity.

""Over the past few decades, the North American electricity market has
developed into a complex array of cross-border transactions and
relationships,"" said Phil Sharp, former US congressman and chairman of
the CEC's Electricity Advisory Board. ""We need to achieve this new level
of cooperation in our environmental approaches as well.""

The Environmental Profile of the Electricity Sector

The electricity sector is the single largest source of nationally
reported toxins in the United States and Canada and a large source in
Mexico. In the US, the electricity sector emits approximately 25 percent
of all NOx emissions, roughly 35 percent of all CO2 emissions, 25
percent of all mercury emissions and almost 70 percent of SO2 emissions.


These emissions have a large impact on airsheds, watersheds and
migratory species corridors that are often shared between the three
North American countries.

""We want to discuss the possible outcomes from greater efforts to
coordinate federal, state or provincial environmental laws and policies
that relate to the electricity sector,"" said Ferretti. ""How can we
develop more compatible environmental approaches to help make domestic
environmental policies more effective?""

The Effects of an Integrated Electricity Market

One key issue raised in the paper is the effect of market integration on
the competitiveness of particular fuels such as coal, natural gas or
renewables. Fuel choice largely determines environmental impacts from a
specific facility, along with pollution control technologies,
performance standards and regulations.

The paper highlights other impacts of a highly competitive market as
well. For example, concerns about so called ""pollution havens"" arise
when significant differences in environmental laws or enforcement
practices induce power companies to locate their operations in
jurisdictions with lower standards.  

""The CEC Secretariat is exploring what additional environmental policies
will work in this restructured market and how these policies can be
adapted to ensure that they enhance competitiveness and benefit the
entire region,"" said Sharp.

Because trade rules and policy measures directly influence the variables
that drive a successfully integrated North American electricity market,
the working paper also addresses fuel choice, technology, pollution
control strategies and subsidies. The CEC will use the information
gathered during the discussion period to develop a final report that
will be submitted to the Council in early 2002.

1724,"Steve,

After the Napa meeting last December, I headed up a  working group to look at 
coordinating EBS issues Internationally.  Initially I spoke with most of the 
people who signed up for the group, and began gathering comments and 
suggestions for improved coordination.   However, much of the need for a 
working group was reduced for two reasons; first, the addition of Donald 
Lassere provided a person within our group to focus exclusively on 
international coordination, and secondly, the Global Public Affairs 
reorganizations this year solved many of the jurisdictional questions that 
were highlighted by many in my working group.  After the re-org, we saw 
little reason to continue the working group.  

The group did serve as a good sounding board for people to comment on 
communications strategies and  better coordination within Government/Public 
Affairs.  Many of these strategies (particularly more relationship building 
internally) were implemented.  Additionally, the experience was a good one 
simply because it offered an opportunity to better educate other group 
members on EBS and telecommunications in general.

I would not recommend re-forming the group at this time.  I think many of the 
goals the group was initially formed for are actually being achieved now 
through better organizational structures and closer collaboration between EBS 
support personnel and International group members.

Many of the EBS related topics that deserve a collaborative, cross-functional 
process are being examined through informal, ad-hoc working groups now.  For 
instance, based on concerns raised at a recent EBS/Government Affairs 
off-site, we now have an international regulatory/tax/legal working group.  
This group is comprised of participants from Rick Shapiro's group, Mark 
Schroeder's group and EBS commercial support organizations.    

I am a little unclear on what personal feedback you want on group members.  
Please advise what format I should address this in, since I am not a reviewer 
for almost anyone who was in my group.  Suffice to say, everyone was helpful 
during the brief time the working group was in effect.   But I can give more 
detail on individuals if you would like.

Thanks for the opportunity to lead a working group (even for such a short 
time!) and please let me know if I can provide any additional information.  

Best, Scott

1725,"Enron Asks US FERC To Link Mkt-Based Pwr Rates With RTOs

11/20/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Power Marketing Inc. is urging federal 
regulators to withdraw the authority of several electric utilities in the 
U.S. Southeast to sell power at market rates if they fail to join an approved 
independent grid-asset operator by Dec. 15, 2001. 
The Enron Corp. (ENE) power-marketing unit made the suggestion in filings 
Friday in response to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 
December 1999 order encouraging U.S. utilities to turn their high-voltage 
transmission assets over to independent control of regional transmission 
organizations, or RTOs.
The filing came the same day that FERC Commissioner William Massey told a 
gathering of energy lawyers that he would seek to ensure that FERC - on a 
generic, national basis - makes preservation of market-based sales authority 
by utilities contingent upon their joining an FERC-approved RTO. 
Enron limited the applicability of its filing to RTO proposals from utilities 
in the U.S. Southeast: Carolina Power & Light Co. (CPL), Duke Energy Corp. 
(DUK), Florida Power Corp. (FPC), Florida Power & Light Co. (FPL), South 
Carolina Electric & Gas Co. (SCG), Southern Co. (SO). Tampa Electric Co. (TE) 
and the Southwest Power Pool Inc. 
Absent participation in a FERC-approved RTO, ""there is no basis for the 
commission to assume that a transmission owner has mitigated its transmission 
market power and ability to discriminate against its transmission-dependent 
competitors,"" Enron said in its filing. 
Enron noted that FERC called for creation of RTOs after determining that its 
landmark 1996 rules requiring open-access transmission services weren't 
enough to assure that vertically integrated utilities couldn't control their 
transmission assets to financial gain in competitive wholesale power markets. 
""The commission has repeatedly recognized that vertically integrated 
transmission system owners have an inherent incentive to use their 
transmission monopolies to discriminate in favor of their own and affiliated 
power merchant activities,"" Enron said. 
The Houston energy giant noted that FERC staff, in a report detailing 
findings of a national investigation of problems affecting competitive 
wholesale power markets nationally, found that market participants in the 
Southeastern U.S. have less confidence than market participants in other 
regions of the country that their transactions won't be subject to 
discriminatory practices. 
""Selling power at market-based (as opposed to cost-based) rates is not a 
right, but rather a privilege enjoyed by sellers that can demonstrate that 
they are price takers, unable to exercise market power,"" Enron said. 
""Any vertically integrated transmission monopoly that stops short of taking 
every step that the commission identifies as needed to abate market power and 
root out discrimination should be denied the privilege of selling power at 
market-based rates. It simply cannot be trusted not to abuse the privilege,"" 
Enron said.

1. What is the process post the FL Supreme Court decision.  Did anyone appeal

2. Is it possible for the FERC to simply act to waive the CCN need?  Did we 
ever discuss with FERC counsel the ability for that agency to ""override"" the 
CCN for any filing EWG?  What would they need to do?  Would FERC need to take

1759,"Legislative package only delays pain, critics warn 
By Craig D. Rose 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
September 1, 2000 
Consumer and political leaders -- as well as Sempra Energy's chief executive 
-- said yesterday that the three electricity bills before Gov. Gray Davis do 
nothing to fix the fundamental cause of soaring bills. 
The cause, they say, is that power generators can continue to charge what 
most characterize as exorbitant prices for their electricity -- and consumers 
ultimately face the daunting task of paying them. 
No matter if all of the bills are signed, the leaders say California's power 
market will remain a seller's game that gouges overmatched consumers. And 
while San Diego Gas and Electric Co.'s hard-pressed customers may pay less 
now, they will pay back all or nearly all the savings -- plus interest -- 
beginning in 2003. 
""The governor's bill postpones the pain, but the pain is still there,"" said 
Maureen O'Connor, a former mayor of San Diego who has been active in seeking 
relief from the soaring bills afflicting SDG&E's 1.2 million electricity 
customers. 
The rate bill promoted by Davis and now awaiting his signature will have 
SDG&E's customers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, or 
70 percent more than what they paid as recently as May. 
Power companies, however, will continue to charge the customers as they have; 
presently, they're charging about 21 cents per kilowatt hour for SDG&E 
customers. The difference between 6.5 cents and whatever prices above that 
level emerge from the state's volatile power market will be recorded as IOUs 
for each customer in so-called balancing accounts. 
A second bill before the governor could provide up to $150 million in state 
money to help pay the balancing accounts, but the bulk of the IOUs will 
almost certainly be paid by SDG&E customers themselves when they become due 
in 2003 or 2004. A third bill before the governor would speed the 
construction of power plants. 
So while the rate bill lets customers pay less now than they owe, it 
obligates them to pay the balance with interest later. 
The situation creates the potential for a troublesome compounding effect: The 
higher electricity prices grow, the more is set aside in the balancing 
accounts -- and the greater the wallop to customer wallets when the accounts 
come due. 
Based upon prices now paid for future electric deliveries, Sempra Energy 
estimates customers will owe $664 million by 2003. IOUs of that magnitude, 
said SDG&E, will require that customers pay a surcharge of $40 monthly for a 
year on top of whatever they are already paying for their power bills. 
Keep in mind that typical residential bills at this time last year were about 
$55; they now stand at about $130. Consumer advocates say it's likely power 
prices will remain at levels that will lead to huge debts for customers under 
the Davis proposal. 
""The generators have shown themselves to be unconscionable in extorting 
profits,"" said Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, a San Francisco-based 
consumer group. 
Hoge said the bills that emerged ""seemed the best a corrupt system could spit 
out."" She added that TURN and other groups will shift their focus to 
pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restrain the electric 
generating companies and wholesale power markets. 
FERC, she said, must legally determine if charges from generating companies 
are reasonable. TURN and other groups will also press for re-regulation of 
the industry and will begin to explore municipally owned generating plants. 
Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network supports the Davis 
bill, although he said it won't fix ""the almost irreparably broken California 
energy system."" 
""The problem is that California's electricity customers have been subjected 
to market prices in a dysfunctional energy market,"" Shames said. ""It's a 
market controlled by the sellers of power and their cronies."" 
But Shames said the Davis bill provides at least temporary protection against 
further rate shocks, and he expects taxpayers across the state will 
ultimately assist SDG&E's customers in paying their electricity bills. 
But Jamie Court, executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and 
Consumer Rights, which has called for re-regulation of the industry, opposes 
the rate-cap legislation. 
""This keeps ratepayers and taxpayers on the hook for the costs,"" said Court, 
who added that the bill also locks in near doubling of power rates compared 
to last year. 
Stephen Baum, chief executive officer of Sempra, said the bill puts SDG&E -- 
a Sempra subsidiary -- in the position of financing the difference between 
what power companies charge for their power and what it collect from 
customers over the next three years. 
The balancing accounts, Baum said, could grow so large that they will 
challenge Sempra's ability to borrow to cover them. 
""The problem is with the wholesale markets,"" said Baum, who today becomes 
chairman as well as chief executive of Sempra. ""This legislation does nothing 
but postpone a big bill."" 
He added that Sempra believed the bill included ambiguities that could be 
illegal if not later clarified by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
""If (the PUC) can't or won't, then I think the legislation is legally flawed 
and can't stand,"" Baum said.",Craig D. Rose Gray Davis Maureen O'Connor Davis Nettie Hoge Hoge Michael Shames Stephen Baum Baum,"about 6.5 cents May.

Wattage Monitor Service Teams Help Lower Electric Bills 

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 21 /PRNewswire/ -- As summer temperatures continue to
heat up and electricity prices do the same, Wattage Monitor Inc.
(OTC Bulletin Board: WMON) offers consumers an escape by locating a
competitive supplier that can lower their bills.
    Customers of San Diego Gas & Electric can choose to buy electric power
from 14 other companies besides their regulated utility.  Most of these
competing companies allow Wattage Monitor system users to switch to their
service automatically.  And there are savings to be had.  In some cases
competing suppliers are offering as much as $120 per year in savings or more.
    ""With the surge in power prices has come great interest in saving on
electric bills,"" notes Gerald R. Alderson, President of Wattage Monitor.  ""In
response we have expanded our service, sent consumer service teams to
San Diego to help consumers choose a supplier and have made it easier to
switch on-line at http://www.wattagemonitor.com or through our toll-free 
service
reached by calling 1-888-WATTAGE,"" he added.
    The California electricity market is in a significant transition from a
regulated market to a competitive one.  But like telephone long-distance
service, a consumer must switch to a competing supplier to lower their bill.
As consumers increasingly become aware that they have a choice and switch,
competition is expected to produce even greater savings.  But consumers must
act to realize the savings available.
    Wattage Monitor is a nationwide, free to consumers service that offers
residential and commercial electric consumers their specific electric service
options through its website http://www.wattagemonitor.com or its toll-free 
service
888-WATTAGE.  Consumers may also easily and conveniently enroll with the
supplier of their choice.  Competing electric suppliers' rates and services
are posted by zip code.  Simple, straightforward, comparative and all in one
place.

    Within the next decade, LNG will become one of the most reliable energy sources for
    the United States. The opportunities for LNG continue to grow, as illustrated by 
    recent plans to extract 12 Tcf of natural gas from Alaska as early as 2002. As a 
    result of similar discoveries in Australia and other neighboring countries there has 
    been an increase in proposed receiving terminals in the United States. You will hear 
    first hand from current and future terminal owners along with why there is a rush to 
    build LNG carriers. 
 
    Due to the drop in natural gas prices and the United States economic downturn, it is

1766,"Here's the latest on the Iowa customer choice bill--HF #2530. As some of you 
may have noticed in the trade press, there has started to be alot press 
releases from the opponents and proponents of the bill.  The opponents are 
bringing out AARP and the Office of the Consumer Advocate, the proponents 
(that includes us) have been putting out positive  quotes from the School 
boards, the low income community action groups and the retail community.  
Radio ads have started running in both the Des Moines area as well in 
outstate.  

It appears that floor debate will start next Monday, March 27th in the 
House.  It is widely anticipated that debate will go on for many days, with 
the hope that the bill can get passed over to the Senate by April 3, so that 
they can spend at least a week on the debate.

The Governor issued a statement that basically said that his office believed 
that moving forward is a good thing, but that he was going to leave it up to 
the legislators to either vote it up or down.  We believe that if the bill 
comes out in substantially the same manner as it now sits, the Governor will 
sign it.  

There are still raging disagreements on the environmental pieces....Enron has 
tried to remain as neutral as possible on the renewables section due to our 
business interests in Iowa with Enron Wind.  

As I have stated in earlier updates, this bill most likely will not pass 
until the last few days of the session, sometime in Mid April.",,2530,HF AARP the Office of the Consumer Advocate Senate Enron Enron Wind

Calif. Senate Panel To Cite Reliant, Enron For Contempt

(This article was originally published Wednesday.) 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee Wednesday voted to 
cite Reliant Energy (REI) with contempt because the company has refused to 
provide documents for an investigation into wholesale electricity prices in 
the state, said committee Chairman Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana.
The committee also voted to forward a contempt charge for Enron Corp (ENE) to 
the full Senate, where it will be voted on. If the charge is approved, the 
Senate will vote on punishment, which could include hefty fines or 
incarceration of executives. 
Talks between Enron and committee attorneys Monday seemed to indicate the 
company would agree to committee demands, but since then it has become clear 
the company doesn't plan to comply, Dunn said. 
""If you had asked two days ago I'd have said we are cautiously optimistic 
about Enron. Now I'm pessimistic about it. We felt they were indicating to us 
a willingness to do what the other generators were willing to do, but the 
bottom line is that they are not, despite their cooperative-sounding words. 
We are no closer to them coming into compliance than we were a week ago,"" 
Dunn said. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation is requesting 
that Reliant and Enron provide 16 kinds of documents related to market 
behavior, rent a depository for the documents, and sign the committee's 
version of a confidentiality agreement. Both generators have refused to meet 
those demands, Dunn said. 
The committee will drop its contempt charges at any time before a full Senate 
vote if either generator agrees to its requests. 
A report detailing Enron's contempt charge will be sent to the full Senate on 
Thursday for introduction, but is expected to be referred to the Senate Rules 
Committee for review before a floor vote. 
Dunn said he didn't know how long the report would be considered in the Rules 
Committee, but he will ""certainly push them to do it as soon as possible."" 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company ""will continue to negotiate"" 
with the committee. 
Legislators are scheduled to begin a monthlong break Friday, but aren't 
certain that will happen because they still need to pass a budget bill and 
are trying to approve a bill to rescue Edison International (EIX) unit 
Southern California Edison before leaving. 
Dunn said it would take a few days to prepare a report on Reliant's contempt 
charge. 
""We may not be able to forward that report to the Senate floor until the day 
we get back from recess,"" Dunn said. 
No one at Reliant could be immediately reached for comment. 
The committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity 
generators for contempt, but all eventually agreed to provide the requested 
information. 
A Reliant spokesman said later that the company's main difference with the 
committee centered on the signing of the confidentiality agreement. Reliant 
would rather the committee secure a protective order before the company turns 
over the requested documents, said spokesman Richard Wheatley. 
""We respectfully decline to waive our objections, because we have a lot of 
trade secrets and proprietary information at stake,"" he said. 
When asked if the company would take legal action against the committee, 
Wheatley said Reliant was ""keeping all options open."" 
""But, really, we hope to work this out on an informal basis,"" Wheatley said. 
""We don't think this is that big of a stumbling block."" 
Enron filed suit against the committee last week over objections to its 
subpoena of certain financial documents, and said at hearings last week that 
it may sue over its contempt charge as well.

1773,"Yesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session.  Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs.  This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO.  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is ""subject to extension"" if new design requirements are introduced.  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures.  A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached.

One good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance.  We too believe this is necessary.  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance.  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible.  Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market.  We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear.

Background

The Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a ""business plan"" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created.  Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission.  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly.  Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues:  market design and governance.

Market Design

At the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO.  This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years (""Option 1-M""of the Business Plan).  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below).  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years (""Option 2-M"" of the Business Plan).   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 (""Option 3-M"" of the Business Plan).  

We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003.  Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable.  

As noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining ""Best Practices.""  Although PJM also conducted a ""best practices"" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are ""best practices.""  

The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) ""far outstrips"" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support.  However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM.  The Judge states that ""impatience, haste and greed"" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process ""at the expense of sound policy"" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to ""exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint."" See Report, page 18.

Governance

The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance:  interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process.  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option.  Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach.  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures.

PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO.  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs:  5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England.  The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins).  

NY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board.  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO.  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders.  

We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system.

Post Mediation

The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge.  

The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment.  We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition.  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared.

Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal.  Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal.

Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report.

***   CONFIDENTIAL   ***

Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I 
recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to 
understand those reasons).

The original group had 3 meetings between January and March.  The initial 
group consisted of:   
One of our initial directions was to form subgroups with specific tasks, and 
to give people across different parts of the organization a chance to work 
together.  This was organized as: 

Beginning in April, a new subgroup was formed of individuals that had 
individual responsibility for areas where EES might be active 
internationally, and consisted of:  
Rob Hemstock  (Non USA North America)
Amr Ibrahim  (Caribbean)
Luiz Maurer  (South America)
Thane Twiggs  (India)
Mike Grimes (Pacific Rim)
Kyran Hanks (Europe)
Harry Kingerski (USA)

The new subgroup, in effect, replaced the larger group and we have worked 
together through the year as specific, focused needs arose.  I have not 
reconvened the larger group for these two specific reasons:
1) it was clear that, to the extent there were EES international needs, they 
were already being met by Mark Schroeder in Europe and Luiz Maurer in Brazil 
(Scott Porter of EES, in Brazil, made it quite clear he was very happy with 
Luiz.)
2) International EES could not articulate a need from Regulatory Affairs that 
was not being met.  Mark Mueller from EES was very helpful in our initial 
discussions but he said EES was several months away from any viable business 
strategy or regulatory needs.  We were a group ""in search of a client"". 

Individuals in the (April) subgroup have been in touch with regional 
commercial counterparts and we talk as needed.


What did the group accomplish?


Specific products that were developed and shared with the group:

1) A presentation put together by Gloria Ogenyi on regulatory ""Lessons 
Learned"" that can have commercial value, and it includes slides used from 
some commercial presentations from EES USA.      
2)  A table put together by Kyran Hanks that shows regulatory attributes by 
country for Europe.    

3) Information sharing.  It was a good way for people across the organization 
and on different continents to get to know one another.  The contacts made 
were valuable.  (Personally, I know it was valuable for me to say in a couple 
of customer presentations, that Enron is the only retailer where I could, 
when faced with a problem, instantly have people on the phone with experience 
from 5 different continents who could help solve the problem.)


Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?

No, not the larger working group.  I think it is more effective to organize 
activity around specific needs and bring people together to perform the 
function as needed.  It is hard and was hard to keep everybody's attention if 
there is no specific task.


Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future?  
Any changes to the working group process itself?

See above.

It's hysterically funny what people are demanding
of my personal account. People want it updated
immediately and they want the ideas ahead of when
I actually buy (I am doing that). In fact I am letting
our readers front-run me on everything! I reveal what
I am about to recommend and I recommend before I buy.

That's the total antidote to the way Wall Street works.
They want to know how much money I am putting into each
stock. Done. They want the dates that I did it. Harder
because I buy in small increments. They want my stop-loss
limits if I could stop-loss out. I can't do that because
of my holding period, but I will do it anyway and just
not sell. They want better performance and they want it
yesterday or at least when I started this game, and the
market was much higher.

Hey, I am listening! Exclusively on RealMoney.com, you
now have access to my own Personal Portfolio, which is
made up of my picks, shares owned, basis, current value
and gains that he buys and sells on a day-to-day basis.

As of Friday, the portfolio market value is $1,247,537

iRV, Inc. Announces Intent to Acquire Scarab Systems, Inc., Smart CardPayment Solution Provider
BOULDER, Colo., Dec 13, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- The Board of Directors of iRV, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: IRVV) is pleased to announce that the company has signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire Scarab Systems, Inc., a privately held Nevada corporation. Scarab Systems is engaged in the distribution and sale of smart card payment systems for applications in e-commerce, banking, telecommunications, security and personal data transfer. The acquisition will proceed subject to completion of specific terms and conditions to be laid out in a definitive agreement. The transaction is also subject to the completion by Scarab Systems of a private placement and other customary conditions. 

Scarab Systems, Inc. has a license to provide rechargeable stored value smart cards for private label applications that the cardholder can load from a designated banking account via the Internet or via designated Automated Banking Machines (ABM). The funds can be withdrawn from most ATMs worldwide, or the stored value can be used to purchase goods and services anywhere that VISA is accepted, whether online or in brick and mortar businesses. Scarab's payment solutions operate on existing network infrastructures. Unlike many other smart card systems, Scarab's program uses existing processing and billing platforms and encryption technology, which work with existing POS and ATM systems. This technology helps eliminate the usual cost-prohibitive infrastructure required to set up a smart card program. 

""Scarab Systems licensed technology provides exciting prospects for innovative payment solutions that we feel represent a valuable contribution in iRV's strategy of expanding its technological asset base. The acquisition of Scarab represents a critical step in the process of implementing technologies that deliver recurring revenue,"" stated Clifford C. Thygesen, President of iRV, Inc. 

""The public market allows the investment community the opportunity to share in the exciting growth that Scarab Systems and the smart card industry is experiencing. The revised corporate structure will help accelerate the rollout of Scarab's payment system technologies,"" stated Thomas Mills, President of Scarab Systems. 

The smart card industry continues to experience tremendous growth. Each year card sales continue to set records, as the market is poised for enormous prosperity in the new millennium. Smart card sales at $274 Million in 1996 are estimated to be $5 Billion in 2003 (Frost & Sullivan). It is estimated that the industry as a whole will continue to grow at a rate between 30% and 50% annually for the foreseeable future (SBJ Research).

increase in share price of the advertised company. We will 
sell our shares at any time, without notice, be that

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""twea=
ks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.  It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.

In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.

1845,"Greg mentioned today that you had asked about Paul Goddard and his continuing interest in Canada.  I've been offering Paul the chance to do much more outward-facing commercial work digging into things like Huberator and PowerITS (from this morning's articles) as well as any potential sales of our platform technology in Europe.  He expresses keen interest, but his heart seems to be in Canada.  He has committed to come to some career conclusions within the next week or two.

We've also been speaking with Heather Kendall, a director who works for Gary Hickerson in London helping to roll-up the Ag business.  I've worked with her before, and she would be great for EnronOnline's efforts at gaining traction in new products, marketing and origination out of London.  Her issue is wanting to come back to Houston at some point.  I suppose I need your help in 2 ways.  First, if you know Heather and are comfortable nudging her toward our shop, I think it would go a long way.  Second, if you are familiar with anyone else in London with deep Enron background and broad commercial shoulders who's looking for an open lane, we need to talk to them.  Clearly Paul and Lara are doing a great job, but we need even more firepower over there to iron out some of the issues the desks are facing, both internally and externally.

Calger has found a leased plane that costs roughly $13k for one roundtrip and a total of $20k for two round trips.  I had already made arraingements to attend a wedding in Oregon on Saturday night.  It is a good friend of mine and my wife's.  It's in eastern Oregon and is about a four hour drive away.  I see the following choices before me:

1.	Don't go to Colorado.  Tell you guys that I'm a family man and not a company man.
2.	Go to Colorado and fly home commercial on Friday night, leaving at about 4 PM.  Incremental cost of flight would be $500.
3.	Go to Colorado and fly home on the rented plane on early Saturday afternoon.  Incremental cost of flight would be $7,000.
4.	Don't go to wedding.  Tell my wife that I'm a company man and that it is critical that I ride mountain bikes with a bunch of 30-something Enron folks all weekend.

While I have authority to place millions of dollars of the company's money at risk, I don't feel comfortable signing up for a $7,000 extra flight without talking to you guys.  #3, the jet set answer costs quite a bit more, but it dramatically increases the amount of time that I spend in Colorado.  #2 is cost-effective but gives me less than 24 hours in Colorado.  #4, while perhaps appealing to you, doesn't work for me.  #2 is probably preferable to #1, just requires a lot of travel time to me.

1857,"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

some reception sites and see everybody.  I don't know exactly how, but we
are going to try.  Diane can probably update you with more details as it
gets closer.

I want to look at some places near Katy.  I am going to try to look at the
Equestrian Center and maybe the Cinco Ranch Country Club (if it lets
non-members use their facility).  I am going to try to have a all-in-one
place.  Ceremony and Reception.  But I may have to find a church.  Who

Richter has sent you the outline/presentation on e-mail and he and Savita and Jay can describe it all in greater detail if you like. 
 
Savita discussed the presentation and the plan with John Arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality. 
 
Basically it will include a new home page and a new garden page, but the key parts are the expanded quotes screen and the order manager which are a much better use of real estate than the static Reuters content down the side (which will be put in a MyContent button).  This isn't expensive, most of the work is done anyway, but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded.
 
I think it would be positive to do.  It looks better, the Reuters content can be found in a MyContent button and we can use the entire quotes screen to enhance order flow and improve the counterparty experience.  It also shows business as usual with EnronOnline.

First of all HAPPY THANKSGIVING.  We Talked about you and how improtant our
family is on several occasions during the last few days. Hope your
Thanksgiving was as wonderful as ours. Jon Christopher, Mike, Nina, and
Elizabeth were here ( Columbia) for Thanksgiving. As usual, we talked, ate,
and enjoyed each other. It has become a family tradition to go to
Shakespeares Pizza, Ernies (ERNWAS) Steakhouse, and Booches (Hamburgers)
everytime any family member comes. Nina cooked some Russian quisine. The
weather was fairly decent for Missouri Thanksgiving (dry, 30 - 50 F).
Elizabeth saw Rugrats in Paris. Dalmations , and went to the parks. We
stayed behind and did other things including watching ""Hurricane"", a very
powerful movie.  Today we have been taking care of all those errands and
routines that are necessary after a weekend of company. We had a good time.


I talked to Ruby last evening. She has probably telephoned both of you by
now. She is sending some cookies to all of us, mostly using Mother's
recipes. How thankful I am to still have her.  And she seems to be in good
health. She is always so positive. She says that the second week in August
is probably the best weekend for the family reunion at our place in Crane
next year.  That would be August 11. How would that be for the two of you?
It would be fine with us. If you are in agreement I will send out the
invitations soon. If not, let me know so I can change it as you are two
important people for us and for the whole family.

We will be going to Thailand on February 5 and returning on March 4. I will
give you all numbers etc where we can be reached. We will have an apartment
in Bangkok but will be all over the Country. Karl and Ila Kruse will be with
us for two weeks. We are really looking forward to it.

Ken and Linda, we really enjoyed seeing you in Columbia. As usual you were
at your  best.

Sharon, We are having our usual big Christmas party on December 23. Any
chance you would be coming to Columbia? We would sure love to have you if
you
 can.
Ken We discussed getting together in Dec. That may not be possible because
of all of our schedules. If not lets look at jAN. For both of you, what does
your schedule look like?

Dear Mr. Lay,

You might recall very kindly hosting a dinner at The Travellers Club in
London for the first energy retreat that we did with Reinhold Heus and Ralph
Hodge. We were very sorry to have missed you this year though we very much
understand that campaigning for the elections was an absolute priority.

I was very pleased to hear that you had tentatively agreed to be able to
make the 25th May free for next years retreat. This years theme, after a
great del of research is set to focus on e commerce and the new economy and
will look at the inter relationship between energy, communication and
investment. I therefore thought that it would be particularly appropriate
given the outstanding work that you are doing in this area. I am sure that
you will feel that the participants are of great interest and I hope that it
will be a real learning experience for both the state companies and the
international energy companies.

As before the group will be limited to 60 top-level executives from
multinationals, independents and state companies and we would aim that some
of the main issues to be covered include:
* Corporate renewal - develop and maintain a competitive edge
* Diversification in the energy industry: into telecommunications,
power, water, e-commerce, trading, auto  - energy in the new economy
* E - Commerce
* Breakthrough in new technologies

I do hope that you are able to confirm your keynote attendance and look
forward to hearing from you.

I also thought that you might be interested in the attached outlining the
governments with which we work.
I very much look forward to hearing from you. .

In the meantime I remain,

Yours sincerely,

1897,"Dear Dr. Lay,

On  Friday, September 8, 2000, I was on a business trip in Findlay, Ohio meeting with Marathon Ashland Petroleum Company Inc. We had recently signed a  five year  electric deal in Houston covering their  Illinois pipeline and terminal facilities behind four utlities. I was there at their request to review other opportunities in Illinois and Ohio and present them with small gifts over a celebration dinner with their spouses. On Saturday, September 9, 2000 at approximately 5:30 am I was struck in my car by an eighteen wheeler passing traffic in a no passing zone.
Your kindness in providing my wife and I with your personal jet so that I could transfer from the Toledo trauma facility I was in, to a local hospital in our home state of New Jersey was greatly appreciated. I needed to be with my daughters and family and be fully evaluated for the multiple traumas I suffered. Getting home meant everything to us at the time, and there were no good alternatives before your generous gesture.
Since last year I have had three surgeries and am preparing for cervical spine surgery October 23, 2001, followed by knee surgery and ankle surgery. It has been an immensely stressful time for all of us, but we always come back to your help at our time of need. In addition, Dr. Lay, I cannot say enough about the kindness and care of Mark Harada, my supervisor and friend, who was at my side after the accident and who has been an endless source of support through our difficult times.
Mark Harada has been recognized by Enron for the exceptional individual he is. His potential value to Enron is immeasurable. He is truly the embodiment of what an Enron manager should be. I was saddened to hear his leadership role in EES had been diminished. He is exceptional.
Based on the  surgeries that lay ahead of me, with the accompanying rehabilitation periods, it appears that I will not be returning to EES for several months. That is why I'm writing to you now. This was a long overdue note of thanks.
Lastly, in a conversation with John Boosey, (formerly Enserch), before his death, he asked if I spoke with you, to pass on his regards. John was a mentor to me during my years with Enserch/Ebasco and had been in ill health for some time.
Finally, from my wife, Dr. Gail Holian Pestana and I, thank you again for bringing us home.

Our Best Regards,

Joe and Gail",Lay Mark Harada John Boosey Enserch John Gail Holian Pestana Joe Gail,,Marathon Ashland Petroleum Company Inc. Enron EES Enserch/Ebasco

Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you had 
several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some agreements.  I 
understand that a conference call to generate a strategy regarding our 
approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to explain to me what 
approach  you took or what the nature is of any agreements or accomodations 
that you may have struck in these meetings.  I think it is important that I 
and the rest of the task force be involved in the setting of strategy even if 
we will call on you to conduct any of the discussions and it is clear that it 
is cooperation and coordination is paramount.

Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of any 
agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate better 
coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to Metgas.  
I am available by phone day or night.

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS: Nineteen IP phone manufacturers select TI DSP-based
technologies to speed IP phone deployment=1DTI's integrated silicon and sof=
tware
powers 80% of the IP phone market

DALLAS, May 30, 2001 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Leveraging the processing
performance and low power of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) (TI=
)
technologies to rapidly deploy enterprise Internet Protocol (IP) telephone
solutions, 19 new customers have selected TI as their vendor. The integrati=
on of
TI's programmable digital signal processors (DSPs) and Telogy Software prod=
ucts
provides the required performance, ultra-low power efficiency and flexibili=
ty to
execute voice encoding and compression, while saving system costs and reduc=
ing
overall power consumption.(see: http://www.ti.com/sc/ipphone)

The new customers include ACT, ADTech, AltiGen Communications, BONA Technol=
ogy,
Cetacean Networks, Telefonica, Global Internet Telephone AG(GITel).

TI now has more than 50 enterprise IP phone customers including 3Com
Corporation, Ascom, CIDCO, Circa Communications/Polycom, Cisco Systems,
congruency, Ericsson, Nortel Networks and TelStrat.

""One of the reasons we chose TI's enterprise IP phone solution is because o=
f the
complete integration of TI's programmable DSP technology with TI's Telogy
Software products,"" said Richard De Soto, Chief Marketing Officer of AltiGe=
n
Communications Inc. ""The software enables the delivery of
better-than-toll-quality voice and the complete solution delivers the
programmability into new evolving standards. It is just what we were lookin=
g for
as we made our investment in the underlying technology for our AltiServ IP =
PBX
and IP phones.""

Enterprise IP phones are one of the most rapidly growing forms of Internet
telephony. In fact, Allied Business Intelligence research predicts that the=
 IP
phone market will reach 51.4 million 2005. And according to a recent study =
by
Phillips InfoTech, IP Local Area Network (LAN) telephony represents the nex=
t
generation of phone systems. For most enterprises the decision to implement=
 IP
LAN telephony is really a question of 'when' not a question of 'if.' ""

The potential obstacles most often cited by decision-makers in both large a=
nd
small enterprises regarding the timeframe for deciding to implement IP LAN
telephony are: reliability, voice quality, price and scalability, according=
 to
the Phillips InfoTech study.

""With TI, Cetacean Networks has solved the problems surrounding the deploym=
ent
of new revenue generating, real-time applications and services to meet the
capacity and scalability of new telephony and real-time networks,"" said Ste=
ven
Rogers, President and CEO, Cetacean Networks.

Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal proces=
sing
and analog technologies, the semiconductor engines of the Internet age. The
company's businesses also include materials and controls, and educational a=
nd
productivity solutions. TI is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and has
manufacturing or sales operations in more than 25 countries.

Texas Instruments is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol=
 TXN.

Whose Desktop Is It, Anyway?

Over the weekend and today, everybody went high with stories about the
AOL-Microsoft talks. They're off. No, they're back on. You could find
support for any theory you liked, amid all the leaking and the
spinning.

The Washington Post's Saturday story said that the talks had broken
down on Friday, and it outlined some of the possible reasons for the
rift. The paper cited a theory that the sticking point was Microsoft's
desire that AOL make its Instant Messaging service compatible with
Microsoft's. Another version claimed that Microsoft wanted AOL to sign
an exclusive deal to use its Media Player, locking out rival
RealNetworks, the media solution now used by AOL. The Post's reporter
was skeptical of both explanations of why the talks tanked.

Today's stories all noted that the talks had resumed over the weekend.
The Wall Street Journal explored some of the nuances in the giants'
relationship with an explanation of how Microsoft is changing what it
means to be ""on the desktop."" It seems the company's new Windows XP,
to be released in the fall, will boot up initially without the
familiar scatter of icons on the desktop. Users will be able to add
icons, according to the Journal, but a new program called ""the
sweeper"" will ask them periodically if they want to remove the less
frequently used ones. Microsoft's detailed control over the user's
experience prompted AOL to tell lawmakers recently that Windows XP is
""anti-innovation, anti-consumer and anti-competitive,"" according to
the Journal.

Writing in the New York Times, John Markoff updated the story with the
help of his own anonymous sources, who told him that Microsoft had
been ""trying to persuade AOL to agree not to lobby against Microsoft
in current or future court battles,"" but that AOL is ""holding open the
possibility of pursuing (antitrust) action"" against Microsoft if the
talks break down. No-namers inside AOL told Markoff that the media
giant has grown increasingly concerned of late over Microsoft's
Dot-Net strategy and its plans for Hailstorm, a technology intended to
aggregate consumers' personal information and transactions. Markoff
concluded with a review of the Internet appliance that AOL had once
planned to introduce. Markoff quoted another no-namer who said that
AOL has ""backed off on that and decided not to compete and to come in
through the living room instead."" - Keith Dawson

1934,"California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20

El Paso Natural Gas ""is willing to expand its system"" to the California 
border if ""sufficient support"" for such a project can be demonstrated through 
long-term capacity contracts, the pipeline told FERC. 
The pipeline's comments were in response to a Commission inquiry asking El 
Paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed Line 2000 
crude-oil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline 
capacity crunch in the West.  Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of 
Energy Projects, raised the prospect in a Jan. 3 letter to El Paso, saying 
that modifying the project ""could assist the difficult situation"" now facing 
the California gas market. 
Specifically, the Commission has recommended that El Paso amend a pending 
application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 
1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and 
convert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends 
from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service 
a 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line 
2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a 
system expansion. 
However, ""there are several ways that an expansion could be accomplished,"" 
wrote El Paso Vice President Al Clark on Jan. 15. ""El Paso could add 
compression to the proposed Line 2000 project, or it could replace or 
recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon 
in place."" As a third option, he said El Paso could add new compression to 
its existing system or loop either the existing system or Line 2000 project. 
The ""preferable method will have to be determined by a careful analysis of 
the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity, 
i.e. where they want to put gas into El Paso's system and where they want the 
gas delivered,"" Clark said. 
As a ""first step"" towards gauging market support for an expansion, he noted 
that El Paso on Jan. 12 posted 1.2 Bcf/d of California-bound pipeline 
capacity for sale effective June 1 of this year. The capacity currently is 
held by affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy, whose contracts expire May 31. 
When the posting results are known, ""El Paso will determine whether another 
open season is needed to solicit expressions of interest in additional 
pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of California."" 
If El Paso finds there is an ""unmet demand for additional capacity"" on its 
system, the pipeline at that time ""will evaluate whether an expansion of the 
existing system or a modification of the Line 2000 project, or both, is the 
appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion,"" Clark noted. 
In the meantime, he urged the Commission to approve El Paso's application for 
the Line 2000 project as it was filed. Not only will the project ""increase 
the operational flexibility"" of El Paso's current system, but converting the 
line from oil to gas service will be a ""necessary prerequisite"" to any future 
expansion of the pipeline's system, according to Clark.

1968,"Olympian Status for U.S. Gas Market 

Just so you'll know: ""The natural gas market is a real success story. ...FERC 
has gotten an enormous amount of things right. The market may not be 
unblemished, but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best 
market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across 
dozens of products. It's something everyone should be proud of,"" Robert Levin 
of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday. 

""The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of 
market conditions with hundreds, if not thousands of market participants, 
using an extraordinary selection of market instruments,"" Levin continued, 
adding that the Commission should be supporting the ""growth and increased 
sophistication of commerce. You're at that point now."" 

Warning against so-called solutions offered by some at the day-long 
conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the 
electric market, Levin cautioned, ""liquidity cannot be legislated. Don't 
overreact. The electric market is poorly regulated. Remedies from the natural 
gas market should be transferred to the electric market, rather than allow 
the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric 
market. 

""Rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas, change 
the electric market,"" which Levin believes has developed its over-emphasis on 
the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market. 

But while Levin warned against too much market meddling, others among the 
more than 30 representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at 
FERC's conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of 
initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline 
transportation. 

Eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, promoting expansion of the 
existing pipeline infrastructure (especially in the Northeast), doing away 
with straight-fix-variable (SFV) rate design, review of firm-to-wellhead 
rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs 
between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered 
by mostly pipeline customers. 

However, greater gas market liquidity shouldn't be confused with increased 
competition in pipeline transportation, municipals and producers told FERC 
staff during a post-Order 637 technical conference Wednesday. ""...[W]e're 
concerned the Commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in 
pipeline transportation. The two are not the same,"" said Arthur Corbin on 
behalf of the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents 
municipal gas distributors. 

""Even with greater and greater market liquidity, monopoly power exists in 
[the] pipeline transportation segment. Captive shippers will always require a 
regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate,"" he said. 

Much the same holds true for LDCs, noted Bruce Henning, director of energy 
practices for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc. (EEA), who represented 
the American Gas Association (AGA) at the Commission staff conference. He 
agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably, but he added ""there's not 
a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location. 
Nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the 
near future..."" Consequently, Henning said FERC will need to continue to 
protect producers from market power that accompanies ""limited access"" to 
pipelines. 

The day-long conference held yesterday in Washington D.C. was the first of 
several that FERC staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the 
Commission's transportation policies on the development of gas markets. 

Christopher A. Helms, president and COO of Panhandle Pipeline Companies, 
urged FERC not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market 
liquidity as the ""ultimate goal"" at the expense of the transportation market. 
Helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and 
construction of ""optimal amounts of additional capacity"" to meet the needs of 
the market. ""The single most important characteristic for liquidity in the 
natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation 
capacity."" 

Charles Daverio, vice president of KeySpan Corp., echoed that sentiment, 
saying FERC could increase liquidity in the New York City market and 
elsewhere in the Northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity 
to ensure adequate supplies for the region year-round. This would reduce 
energy costs and enhance reliability, he noted. 

Panhandle's Helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the 
development of new market centers and hubs. Market centers should be allowed 
to develop at their ""own pace,"" and at locations where the market ""sees fit,"" 
he said. 

EEA's Henning estimated more than 40 ""liquid and transparent"" market centers 
exist today, which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily 
under ""extremely competitive"" conditions. He said he's ""confident"" more will 
be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers. As 
another way to enhance liquidity, KeySpan's Daverio ","Robert Levin

1981,"El Paso Pipeline Update - The US Dept. of Transportation approved reinstating 
gas service for El Paso's Line 1100 damaged in the recent explosion.  This 
brought 400 million cfd of capacity back on stream to the California border.  
The ruptured Line 1103 will not be repaired until further investigations have 
been completed.  The availability of Line 1100 capacity had the following 
basis impact:  Permian to California basis for October dropped from Monday by 
$1.30/MMBtu while November '00 - March '01 and April - October '01 narrowed 
by $0.43 and $0.37 respectively.  Also, TW shippers are no longer using El 
Paso Window Rock as a receipt point on our system.

Transport Options Program - Representatives from 7 companies comprising a 
majority of TW's larger shippers attended our workshop on this new tariff 
filing.  All attendees were given in advance of the meeting a draft copy of 
the proposed filing for their review and comment.  The TW Team (Jeff Fawcett 
and Susan Scott) did an outstanding job of preparing the material, answering 
questions, and anticipating shipper concerns related to this new service.  
The only serious objections raised  by the customers were concerns related 
to: (1) potential abuses by marketing affiliates and (2) hoarding of option 
capacity by any one shipper.  Among the  solutions proposed were restricting 
Enron affiliates  access to the program and limiting the volume of 
outstanding options any one shipper can hold.  At the end of the meeting, we 
asked for final comments to be submitted to TW by next week in anticipation 
of filing the tariff with the FERC in mid-September.

KN/Oneok Contract -  We negotiated a 12 month max rate agreement with Oneok 
for 20,000 MMBtu/d of west flow capacity starting February 1, 2001.  We also 
negotiated in the contract a provision whereby if Oneok releases any of the 
capacity above the max rate, then TW shares 50/50 in the incremental revenue.

EOG Resources - We are negotiating a new transport agreement with EOG for 
incremental volume they could bring into TW's West Texas lateral.  Initially, 
the volume was 4 - 5,000 MMBtu/d but now may be at least 15,000 MMBtu/d.  EOG 
is reviewing the proposed interconnect and operating agreement.  EOG has not 
typically held transport capacity on TW in the past.

September Pipe Outage - We are trying to accommodate west flowing shippers 
whose transport will be cut from September 6-10 due to DOT testing on 
Transwestern.  The plan is to facilitate the use of PG&E Market Center 
storage to supply west markets during the outage.  Volume may be as high as 
20 -50,000 MMBtu/d at an incremental rate for TW of $.05 -.08/MMBtu.

1982,"Note:  Alliance announced an October 30 official in-service date for tariff 
services; however, they will be selling test gas in 
ramp up period.  Right now, these first deliveries are going into the ANR 
system because it is the only interconnect that is 
ready.

Alliance Delayed, But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up

After months of speculation in the industry, Alliance Pipeline confirmed 
yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct. 
30. When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago, 
Oct. 2 was the target date for commercial service. 

However, the delay doesn't mean the market won't be getting any Canadian gas 
out of Alliance until the end of October. The pipeline opened one of its 
Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling 50-100 MMcf/d of 
gas into the market. It intends to increase its sales each week eventually 
reaching its full 1.325 Bcf/d load prior to switching to commercial service 
on Oct. 30, said spokesman Jack Crawford. 

""We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas. Right now I think 
we are dealing with three or four different marketers. Our initial deliveries 
right now are into the ANR system. That's because its basically the only 
connection that is ready, but over the next few weeks we expect they will all 
be ready to go and we will test them all. 

""I'd be surprised if it ends up being regular [volume increases of 100 MMcf/d 
each week] but that's kind of the game plan,"" said Crawford. ""On Oct. 29 it 
will be Alliance selling [1.325 Bcf/d of] test gas, and on Oct. 30 it will be 
shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other. The market may 
not see much of a difference. We obviously don't want to start charging our 
shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked 
out."" 

The pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of 
northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta to the Chicago area 
where the line interconnects with the North American pipeline grid. 
Currently, more than 99% of the total pipeline system has been installed, 
including 14 mainline compressor stations, 37 receipt points in British 
Columbia and Alberta, and 7 delivery points in Illinois. Commissioning 
activities commenced in March, including the flowing of gas into the 
completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe. At present, 
approximately 95% of Alliance has been purged of air. This includes all the 
mainline portion of the system (1,857 miles) from near Gordondale, Alberta to 
the delivery section near Joliet, Illinois and 306 of 434 mile laterals 
receipt portion of the system. Additionally, 25 receipt point meter stations 
have been commissioned. Final commissioning activities are also being 
completed at 14 mainline compressor stations. To date, 6 Bcf of gas is in the 
commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system, with the ultimate 
line pack targeted at 8 Bcf. 

Crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed 
start-up. ""The rain in Saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in July, but we 
managed to catch up on the construction there in August. But it then meant 
that some of our commissioning didn't get going until a little bit later. 
Farther west in Alberta and BC in fact we've had a couple of rain problems. 
In particular, we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we 
haven't even been able to get on the right of way yet and that's because of 
rain. 

""Up in BC we've been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on 
one of our laterals up there,"" he said. ""We're likely to get approval to 
open-cut that creek, but that will take us probably the better part of a 
month. 

""On the downstream end, we had hoped to get more of our downstream 
connections right now. We are testing one, but some of the others aren't 
quite ready yet. We're ready, but they are not. Then of course there is a 
fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the [Aux Sable liquids] 
plant. We haven't had a chance to work on that yet. So when you look at all 
of those things, the question was when could we establish a date when all 
this stuff would be done and we would be operational. We spent a fair amount 
of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was 
being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction. We agreed we would 
pick one of three dates, all Mondays: Oct. 2, Oct. 16 or Oct. 30, and we just 
had to pick one that we felt confident in."" 

Besides the timing of service, there has been another important question on 
the minds of many market observers. Will the gas Alliance ships come Oct. 30 
be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through TransCanada. 

""I don't think it's going to be purely either way,"" said Crawford. ""Lots of 
guys are targeting for Nov. 1 to bring their new gas on to start the gas year 
so it all depends on how much shows up. It's not a big secret that we've had 
some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasn't gotten 
done. That's likely to have some affect on it as well. That's a delay though. 
How long are people going to pay $6 for gas? Boy, people are going to have a 
lot of money for drilling and projects.""

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Pontiac TSS.  
Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission 
Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of 
receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the 
ComEd queue.  If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the 
ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

added to the waiver of consequential damages.  Bob had added a provision that 
said that the waiver was ""subject to"" the indemnification section of the 
contract.  I felt this was too broad of a carve out, especially from the 
contractor's point of view.   Any tweaking of the indemnity language (to 
blatantly reconcile it with the waiver) can occur during the drafting process.

Just wanted to pass this along.

2105,"Here are my initial comments:

There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval 
process.  For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re 
landscaping).  It would be easier to process this agreement if the 
effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building 
permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the 
time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.

Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for 
the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.  Other 
than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to 
obtain project financing.

Michael was back in the hospital for a week, starting Good Friday, with an

that the bone marrow transplant has been delayed  because of his condition.
His white cells (the infection fighters) are down, so he needs a boost in
their count.  Once they're up to an acceptable level, and everything else is
OK, the transplant process will start.

The marrow was taken from the donor last Thursday, the 3rd.  The report is

2191,"Hi Hon...Jack forwarded this to us 
Subject: Fw: PANCAKES  
Six-year-old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents  
pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter,  
opened the cupboard and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it  
on  
the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands,  
mixed  
in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail on  
the  
floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  
Brandon was covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to  
be  
something very good for Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He  
didn't  
know what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove  
(and he didn't know how the stove worked!).  
Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and reached to  
push  
her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried to  
clean  
up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his pajamas white  
and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.  
Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was  
something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a  scolding was  
coming, maybe even a spanking. But his father just watched him. Then,  
walking  
through the mess, he picked up his crying son, hugged him and loved him,  
getting his own pajamas white and sticky in the process.  
That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it  
turns into a mess. Our marriage gets all sticky or we insult a friend or  
we  
can't stand our job or our health goes sour. Sometimes we just stand there  
in  
tears because we can't think of anything else to do.  
That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some  
of  
our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't  
stop  
trying to ""make pancakes,"" for God or for others. Sooner or later we'll  
get  
it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...  
Please pass some of this love on to others.......... suppose one morning  
you  
never wake up, do all your friends know you love them? I was  thinking...  
I  
could die today, tomorrow or next week and I wondered if I had any wounds  
needing to be healed, friendships that need rekindling or three words  
needing  
to be said, sometimes, ""I love you"" can heal & bless. Let everyone of your  
friends know you love them, Even if you think they don't love back, you  
would  
be amazed at what those three  little words and a smile can do. Just in  
case  
I die tomorrow...I  LOVE YA!!!

     Eric Thode's comment reported by Dow Jones yesterday that ""most of Enron's critical employees are under contract"" is not sitting well with my people--particularly Mary Kay, Rob and Steve.  He also made a comment that bonuses were ""scheduled to be paid in mid-February"" (a statement on a delicate subject that did not need to be made).  I know that some of this stuff can't be avoided, but I don't think we're even being careful about what is, or is not, said in the media.

Mike Brown, David Terlip, Janice Moore and I met today.  Plan is for Mike to 
get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.  If Siemens 
amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's 
spec to us.  Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens.   
If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy.  
This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo 
""off spec"" demand separate test using ""ashing"" technique (more likely to 
pass) and if it passes using ""ashing"" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute 
over acceptance of ""ashing"" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected 
(either because First Gas refuses to accept ""ashing"" or because off spec even 
with ""ashing"") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative 
supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a 
possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.  
This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on 
spec.

Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a 
status report.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

I just talked to Rich.  I told him about the timing of the settlement 
proposal and that we should hear back late next week.  I also suggested that 
if we get a negative response, that you and i would give him a call and 
update.   He is being patient but I have a feeling that it has its limits.  
His response is logical to this point because as he stated, there should be a 
lot of money in this for both parties and thus a commercial settlement.

Thanks for the update.  I will not have an opportunity to talk with you right 
now.  I am in Tokyo and my next destination may change due to business events 
in the middle east.

I am very interested in acquiring Blue note, however,  I do want to know more 
about the price.  I was close to locating one via a gallery via ebay for a 
lot less.  Also, your price was $4,500 for the same piece framed.  Is there 
room on the price if I give you a firm commitment.  The ebay price is 
significantly discounted but they are not ready to close the deal yet 
either.  If you can't get them down on the price,  it is worth me chasing 
down the other option for a while.

Please let me know via email and I will attempt to be responsive via odd time

 At our offsite in Miami next week, each of you are on the agenda to present 
your business and goals.  This will be very short, only 20 minutes (an agenda 
will soon follow but we will have a business meeting from 8am - 11:30am on 
Saturday).  Please prepare a few of pages on power point and submit to Cathy 
Phillips so that she can have all the presentations ready for that Saturday 
morning.  

Attached below is a copy of the abbreviated goals that I submitted to 
Frevert, summarizing EGM's 2001 goals.  Please do not hesitate to change the 
list and add to it, it is only a guide and was used as a quick reference of 
EGM for the Enron board.  After this meeting, I will take each of your 
presentations and make a more comprehensive goals and objectives list for EGM 
as a business unit.  Also please add some of your other specific goals that 
illustrate where you want to be by year end regarding your competitive 
position and/or market share.  For example, to be the largest marketer of 
coal in the US, to be the largest options player in crude and products, or 
what ever is appropriate.

Also attached, for your information, is a recent  presentation from the coal 
group.  We thought that this was an excellent format and review.  In the 
upcoming weeks, we would like to see an update on each of your businesses as 
well.  I will let you know more in the next few weeks about the timing and 
format.

WEAK FINISH TO NOVEMBER SEEN . . .

 Natural gas futures worked higher in active options related trading Friday  on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices opened higher and marched higher in mostly uninterrupted fashion and managed to close at the high end of the day's trading. Short term traders see efforts to push the November contract lower on Monday's expiration. . .

 At the close of trading, the November contract added $.103 to $3.041 per MMBtu. The December gained $.080 to $3.183 per MMBtu. . .

 ""I believe that traders are looking for a weak finish to the November contract on Monday. There are indications that they want to crush the November contract,"" said a New York floor trader. . .

 ""Many of the local traders are short and took short positions home with
them over the weekend,"" he said.

2231,"Susan

As per our phone conversation, I am dropping you a note to explain why there was a decrease in the sales volumes for Canada
from the first to second quarter 2001.

There are two reasons for the decline in sales volumes:

	1.  Last year EOL offered a fixed rate product that produced minimal margins but a large volume of transactions.
	     It was decided that this product would not be offered in the year of 2001, but because there were winter deals
	     that continued through to March 2001, we did not see a decline in volumes until April 2001.

           2.   Enron Canada was involved in ligitation with NGX, with respect to their publication of the Aeco index.  ECC did
	     not have any confidence in the index because the EOL deals were not included in determining the Aeco monthly index
	     and we felt the index could easily be manipulated.  As a result, ECC was hesistant to enter into Aeco Monthly index 
                 deals with counterparties thus reducing our volume of sales.

I hope this helps!

Hi Jon,
I guess it isn't critical that we see whether the  trades are a buy or a sell.  The reason that I had requested this was to  ensure that I has both sides of the trade but in your case you may be long or  short depending on the circumstance.  Therefore, if you could just include  the Enron trades so that we have an accruate picture of the volume traded by  Enron that would fulfill our needs for the pie charts.  I understand your  concern regarding your position and do not necessarily need this information if  there is another way to get to the place we need to be with the pie  chart. 
Unfortunately, I am not in the office on Monday or Tuesday  so will not be able to reach you.  If you have any further concerns please  call me on Wednesday to discuss.

2252,"Due to problems experienced by TAGG Deal Capture users a couple of weeks ago, 
we have made some modifications that will change the process of how a deal 
ticket is produced. Under the previous process, a user will request a Deal 
ticket to be generated and the TAGG application would basically schedule a 
job to generate and print the report on UNIX. The amount of time between the 
moment the user would click on the button to generate Deal Ticket and the 
time the actual ticket  printed was dependent on the amount of activity in 
the whole TAGG system. This time would range from about one minute to several 
minutes. Also, sometimes the ticket would never print. On the new version of 
the application, the report is generated directly from the user's machine and 
it will print on the default printer used by all the other windows 
applications on user's machine.  For  those users using dial-up, the 
processing will be done on the dial-up machine and the report will print on 
the default printer attached to the dial-up machine. From the user's point of 
view, in order to generate a Deal Ticket they need to follow exactly the same 
steps they were doing before. The processing going on behind the scenes will 
be different, but report will print almost instantaneously. Every effort has 
been made to replicate the report as close as possible, but there will be 
minor differences in formatting between old and new reports. 
We have put the new version of the TAGG application in the staging area. 
Please feel free to test it and verify that the information shown on Deal 
Ticket report is accurate. We have received feedback from people in London, 
Calgary and Singapore verifying that new version of report is correct. We are 
currently planning to roll this change into production the weekend of March 
10. If you have questions/problems or suggestions related to these changes, 
please notify Oscar Rivera x5-3361 or Sanjeev Gupta x5-3816 asap.

2253,"California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

2273,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program

2295,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

2339,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

2366,"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

2379,"Hey Nella,

When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday.  He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me asking about it.  He even said ""You are so sweet with words"".

He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.

How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.  Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.

This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.


Talk with you later

Thank you",,,

like?",,,
2382,"Hi Rev. Jackson

How's it going?  I'm sure I'll be seeing you tonight at choir rehearsal, but 
I was curious if anything new happened on the choir director front?

Let me know if you get this e-mail in time to respond.  I'll be leaving at 
5:00 directly.

See you tonight!",Jackson,,
2383,"Nothing has happened, it seems like he's trying to stick close to home.  I 
came in on Monday night and went upstairs, because I frankly, did not want to 
talk and did not want to get mad in front of Jordan.   I was furious and I 
still am furious.  Last night we had choir rehearsal, so he was in bed when i 
came back.  I really don't want to talk to him right now.   I'll keep you 
posted, because I will be doing it hopefully, tonight!

See you later.

Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.",,,Enron

2441,"Re:  Dealing with today's uncertain business climate:  How using LRSolutions will help your legal department reduce outside counsel fees, increase legal knowledge and expertise in-house and save countless hours of time for busy in-house attorneys

As you are well aware, legal research and related knowledge activities and products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise. In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas.  With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis.  Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis.

Traditionally, corporate counsel respond by utilizing outside law firms for many research and writing projects that could have been done internally if only they possessed the knowledge, resources, and time.  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of ""reinventing the wheel"", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to the enormous costs for corporate counsel.  Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive.  With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.  At the same time, associates are likely to miss subtle nuances in the law that can be damaging to the client.  In today's economy, it is absolutely essential for companies to reduce outside legal costs while retaining qu!
al!
ity and value.  In addition to saving costs, companies must be able to effectively manage risk in a proactive fashion, in order to avoid potential disaster.

LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and quality. Experienced, in-house, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.  LRSolutions' attorneys truly enjoy doing research, and analyzing complex legal issues.  In addition, we work with our network of legal experts that include hundreds of the nation's premier law professors and other distinguished attorneys organized intuitively into areas of specialty. Only experts in the field can produce a product in the most efficient manner, without
missing crucial issues and predict ultimate cost.  Now, for a predetermined, fixed price, you can combine legal expertise with enormous cost savings.  Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com.

Our products and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials such as appellate briefs and court filings, regulatory handbooks and manuals in every conceivable area of law (enabling your company to better manage risk and raise legal awareness), contract and other document drafting, settlement packages, and listings of relevant authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and objective that best suits your needs.  We can work with your outside counsel as part of your overall legal team, or provide an alternative to utilization of outside counsel as well as support for in-house projects.

If you would like to contact me by phone, please feel free to call at 1-800-627-8047, ext. 1.  Again, our website is http://www.lrsolutions.com.  Please also feel free to reply via email as well.  I am convinced that LRSolutions will be a critical and welcome long-term resource for your legal department as you attempt to deal with today's uncertain business climate, and I greatly look forward to speaking with you.

Just wanted to see if you got to work okay!  Guess who was up in our studios
this morning????  Yep, you guessed it Deblah Morgan.  She is actually a
really young singer and she is more on the Hip Hop side of the music
business.  Anyway, I actually would have never known who she was unless
someone had told me.

So, what are you thinking about tonight.  Do you want to see if Eric and Jenn
and David and whoever else want to meet downtown at Salintes?

Also, were you being serious about China?  I really would consider it, but I
need to get more details about dates, etc.  I actually think that would be so

It has actually been kind of nice not to be on a time crunch.  Went out to

I told her that I was going with Renee.  She think looked like a sad puppy

that move.  Oh well, it was good to catch up with someone new.

2477,"Mark,  The following are my responses to Phillip's changes in our letter 
agreement:

1.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph - Strike of reference to Section 3.3 and 
reference to Appendix 1 - ENA's right to decrease confirmed volumes and 
Phillips' rights to release the gas are clearly set out in Section 3.3.  The 
""Operations/Delivery Scheduling Procedures"" only are the method by which this 
is effected.  This change needs to be removed.

2.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph  - The remainder of the changes to the 
1st Sentence except for the strike of Seller's Daily Deliverability are OK.  
Seller's Daily Deliverability needs to remain as this is the correct 
terminology under the Purchase Agreement.  All we are doing here is effecting 
the provisions of the Purchase Agreement to which both parties have already 
agreed.

3.  The added sentence at the end of the second paragraph - This needs to be 
stricken.  The Medicine Bow System is not ENA's and we do not want to create 
a firm purchase deal with this letter. 

4.  1st Sentence of Third Paragraph - The add from ""that quantity of Gas..... 
to.......... (the ""Released Gas"""" should be removed.  The term Released Gas 
is defined under the Purchase Agreement and doesn't need to be defined in 
this letter.   I am OK with ENA ""hereby"" agreeing to waive any and all rights 
it has to under Section 3.3 to recall the Gas.  However,  the term rights ENA 
""may"" have needs to be stricken.  ENA's position is that we have the right to 
recall the gas as long as it hasn't been released longer than 120 days.     

If you wish to discuss these comments or would like me to discuss these with 
Phillips, I would be happy to do so.

 1.  Enitity Name - You noted that Trailblazer is a limited partnership.  The 
name should designate limited partnership in some form (e.g. Trailblazer 
Pipeline  Company, L.P.)  Also for an LP the General Partner will need to 
sign to make it binding.  The signature block should read as follows:

  Trailblazer Pipeline Company, L.P.
   by its General Partner, _________________________

 2.  The limitation on consequential damages limits any remedy under this 
agreement.  The only types of damages in a situation like this is really   
consequential.  I think it would benefit both parties to leave this 
limitation out of the agreement.

We will agree to this version with the following changes:

""Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the ""Repurchasers"") to
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition
to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force majeure
pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be entitled
to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable
to take delivery of gas as a result of an event of force majeure at such 
Delivery Point)s).  The parties further agree that the term ""Transporter"" 
when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in Sections 4.1. 
and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of a transporter 
for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to 
invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such 
Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received
by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the same
volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such
Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s).""

I have received several questions from the floor regarding the subject topic.  Here is what I know as of 2:00 today.  This is an evolving process.  Please distribute this note as appropriate:

All movement of 'data' from Enron to UBS is subject to legal approval.  Legal is developing policy guidelines that will govern what and how much data individual users and the IT department can move.

Data can be defined as application data (source code, executables, scripts, etc...), business data (curves, prices, deals, weather forecasts, etc...), and office documents (spreadsheets, word files, etc...)

Data is housed in many different places, including desktop C drives, individual network H drives, common file servers (O/M/R/W drives), database servers, application servers, and web servers. 

Several steps have already been completed:

The physical file server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical DB server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical application and web server environments for UBS have been established.
Some file server directories have already been copied.  This was limited to data (executables, risk excel sheets, etc...) necessary for IT to test our critical applications in the new UBS production environment.
Our large EnPower and TDS Oracle databases were also copied for application testing.

Where do we stand?

I am maintaining, and have distributed to this group, an inventory of all software and hardware components associated with our Power application portfolio.  The inventory includes specific common file server directories that are necessary for our Power apps to run.  We have received input from several business owners in this area.
Legal and IT are collaborating on a process for moving file server data. (H/O/M/R/W)  We are expecting a process definition within days, given our Day 0 target of February 6th.  (legal integration date)
At this time, it sounds like individual UBS employees will participate in identifying files on the various file server drives listed above and signing a document specifying that that data movement adheres to legal policy guidelines.  Individuals may even be asked to physically move (drag and drop) files from the old Enron drives to UBS holding drives.  This is still under discussion.
We have made some basic assumptions about the amount of business data to be moved to UBS.  I have provided Tim, Kevin, and Lloyd an overview of these assumptions.  This is also still under discussion.

I will schedule a meeting in the next couple of days to discuss this, and other transition issues, in more detail.

Thanks, Steve

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

2584,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=

Hey Andy,

How are you?  I saw Stephanie a couple of weeks ago in Napa and asked about
you.  Then, I meant to send you a note before now, but better late than
never.  I've been thinking of all of you this week, and hoping that
everything is going ok.  I remember what it is like to have your company the
focus of lots of analyst and media attention, and I hope it turns out fine
you all there.

I don't have any news to tell.  I am doing good, enjoying a beautiful fall
here, but not looking forward to winter.  I may be coming down to the
Nutcracker Market in a couple weeks.  Any chance that you will be there?

You are not pulling in our CGPR-Aeco/Basis Positions into the summary (a

I have put together a quick estimate of the adder to get from the ""two 7EA 
open cycle peaker configuration"" to the ""2x1 combined cycle configuration"", 
adding the two HRSGs and 100 Mw steam turbine along with extra BOP equipment. 
The estimate was quick and is therefore +/- 20% accuracy. Beyond this 
accuracy, we would need a tasking letter.

Your CIPCO Proforma for EPC costs of two 7EAs Open Cycle = $57,580,000 or 
$378.82/Kw

The rough cost estimate (+/-20%) of the 2x1 Combined Cycle  = $130,336,000 or 
$493.70/Kw
 (See Attached Analysis)

The estimated adder for conversion to 2x1 Combined Cycle is therefore:

2643,"Here is a summary of my telephone conversation with Jay Hopper of KN Energy:

1.  KN has permitted its 550 MW Arkansas plant (and received its Entergy 
interconnection agreement) and is out for bid on tolling agreements.  They 
have two counterparties who have bid a 15 year tolling agreement --437 MW, 
mid 7,000 heat rate; 5.75 KW-mo.; 113 MW duct firing, 4.75 KW-mo.; 3.00 mill 
escalating variable O&M charge.  KN has also conducted construction bids. 
[For our LM-6000 activities, seeing all this information would be extremely 
valuable].

2.  KN has a draft air permit on its Jackson Michigan plant.  They will know 
in 45 days if approved.  All other permits received. Since this project was 
first in the cue when we last talked to KN, I suspect something negative has 
happened to slow it down.

3.  KN has sites in Oklahoma, Dallas and Chicago (4).  

4.  KN and another party have 6 7FA turbines for June '01 projects in 
Illinois.  KN supposedly controls the turbines.  I asked KN if they would be 
interested in doing deals in other states with these turbines.  They said 
possibly.  The other counterparty would need an equity participation in the 
end project.  I also told them that to the extent that they did Illinois 
projects, we could be of assistance to them on reg. cap. pricing and sales 
tax strategies.

5.  KN has sites in Ohio and Geary, Indiana where a coal affiliate would take 
back a 30 year 100 mw PPA for both sites.  Given this contract, KN may 
entertain doing a deal with a merchant component.

6.  I asked Jay how KN would be interested in ENA participating in these 
projects.  KN is not interested in taking too much commodity risk.  Hence, 
our proposal of doing a fixed price toll for 5 years and a floating index 
price for an additional 15 years would not be of interest to them (evidently 
Kinder laughed at the proposal; though in Jay's telephone message he 
indicated that Kinder was interested in the structure).  If there was a floor 
that covered debt service in the merchant years (along with some upside 
participation for KN--Jay threw out a 20% participation), then they would be 
interested in doing a deal.  

7.  They would also entertain selling a 50% or 100% interest in these 
projects.

8.  Jay told me that KN is looking to make a steady and predictable income 
from these plants.  Thus far, his group has not made any money.  My sense is 
that they are looking for money or a story (ENA name).  I would suggest 
taking a pass at purchasing the Arkansas plant (to get their attention and 
see their project information) in an effort to get involved in the 7FA and 
ECAR projects.  If KN does have a long-term tolling agreement, then would 
should be able to lay off a large portion of the financial risk associated 
with the Arkansas transaction.  We could also look at applying Don's 
structure to the Arkansas transaction.  Needless to say, the 7FAs slots, if 
real, would allow ENA to do something strategic in Florida and Iowa. ",Jay Hopper Jay Kinder Don,,KN Energy MW O&M KN ENA ECAR

2666,"PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

2694,"Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

We have received your acceptance and you are confirmed for ClickAtHome Pilot 
2.

You will be notified with an e-mail by November 17th on how and when you can 
access the ordering web site. Ordering is not expected to
begin until December. 

As a pilot participant, you will be testing various aspects of this new 
program such as the program offerings, program communications, product and 
service ordering, vendor services and program support.  At this time, the 
pilot program is not intended to provide access to Enron's network for 
telework purposes.   If you need Enron access for business reasons, please 
continue to maintain your existing computer and connection for this purpose.  
 In advance, we appreciate your co-operation and patience under this pilot 
program.  

Employees will have great options under this program for computers, 
peripherals, and Internet connectivity.   Your personal selections will 
determine your out-of-pocket expense, if any.  By participating the Pilot, 
you are not obligated to order hardware or connectivity, but will be given 
the opportunity to review your options and associated prices.

We know you are interested in more details.  However, one of our primary 
Pilot objectives is to test the communication on our web site.  We would like 
you to review more details about program offerings and related out-of-pocket 
costs, if any, once the pilot web site is available.  After agreeing to the

 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of

Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading ""Daily Price Survey"" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and

I know that there is a whole bunch of you on the receiving end of this EMail

their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""

2778,"Here is the Q&A on the agreement and the press release.

 
Merger Q&A
Nov. 9, 2001 
THE DEAL
What are the deal terms?
The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange. 
The exchange ratio will be 0.2685. As an example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 269 shares of the combined company upon closing. 
Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. 
ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately, and an additional $1 billion upon closing of the merger. 
Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock. 
Enron will have immediate access to the $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.
What approvals are required?
This merger will require SEC and FERC approvals, the approval of shareholders of both Enron and Dynegy, and expiration or termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period. In addition, various approvals are required due to the ownership of Enron's and Dynegy's wholly owned subsidiaries.
From a business standpoint, are Enron and Dynegy now one company?
Not until closing, which may not occur for a number of months. Until that time we will continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have done in the past. In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc. We will act towards Dynegy the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.
When do you expect the deal to close?
The transaction is expected to close by the end of Q3 2002.
Why do you believe this is the best deal for shareholders?
The Board considered numerous options-stand-alone execution, private equity infusions, strategic partner infusion and a merger with a strategic partner. The Enron Board felt that the merger with Dynegy, coupled with the $1.5 billion equity investment, was the best opportunity for continued growth and shareholder value.
What is the ownership structure of the new company? 
On a converted basis, Enron shareholders will own approximately 36% of the new company, and Dynegy shareholders will own 64%. Post closing, the combined company is expected to have approximately 700 million shares outstanding.
What percentage of shareholder votes is required to approve the transaction? 
A majority of Enron shareholders must approve the transaction, and 2/3 of Dynegy shareholders must approve.
Has a new management team been identified?
Chuck Watson - Chairman and CEO
Steve Bergstrom - President and COO
Greg Whalley - Executive Vice President
Robert Doty - CFO
Watson, Bergstrom and Whalley will make up the combined company's Office of the Chairman.
Has Dynegy completed due diligence? Are they satisfied that the potential exposure is manageable?
Dynegy has completed significant due diligence and there is no due diligence out as such. Dynegy was fully aware of the matters reported recently with respect to certain financial statement restatements and related party transactions.
How will the Board seats be allocated?
When the merger is complete, the Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of no more than 15 members. Dynegy's designees will include three from ChevronTexaco. Enron will have the right to designate a minimum of three board members.
How will the merger impact customers?
We expect customers to benefit significantly from this combination. This combination provides a wider and more diverse platform to meet the energy needs of our customers with reliable delivery and predictable pricing. Customers will also benefit from broader supply-sources of the two companies.
Does this mean Northern Natural Gas is no longer a part of Enron?
No. Northern Natural Gas will remain an important member of the Enron family. If the merger is terminated Dynegy has a right to acquire Northern Natural Gas, subject to a repurchase right of Enron.
Is Dynegy buying Northern Natural Gas?
No, Dynegy is buying a $1.5 billion preferred stock interest in Northern Natural Gas and acquiring an option to acquire 100% of Northern Natural Gas in certain circumstances if the merger is terminated.
What percent of Northern Natural Gas will Dynegy own?
They will own preferred stock unless and until the merger is terminated and Dynegy exercises its right under certain circumstances to purchase 100% of Northern Natural Gas.
FINANCIAL ISSUES
Why is Enron merging at this price?
Enron's Board of Directors and management considered numerous options to best serve the interest of our shareholders, including: 
Stand-alone execution. 
Private equity infusion. 
Strategic partner infusion. 
A merger with a strategic partner.
The Board and management feel strongly that a merger with Dynegy, which included an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion in cash, offered the best opportunity for continued growth and enhanced shareholder value. 
Have you discussed the combination with the rating agencies?
Yes. The preliminary assessment by the rating agencies has been positive.
ENRON QUESTIONS
What are the immediate business benefits of the transaction?
This deal confirms the value of Enron's core business and strengthens the company's liquidity. This transaction enables the shareholders of both companies to participate in the upside of the combined enterprise.
What will happen to Enron Online?
It will continue as EnronOnline until the transaction closes.
How will you treat proprietary trading information prior to the deal close? What impact will this have on counterparty trading?
Until the deal closes they remain separate companies and will keep confidential trading information confidential.
What will happen to Enron's pending asset sales?
The asset sales we have previously announced are scheduled to move forward.
What happens to the SEC investigation?
As we have from the beginning, Enron will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC investigation.
What happens to the lines of credit Enron took out last week?
Enron drew down on $3 billion from existing credit lines and has obtained commitment letters on an additional $1 billion secured financing.
Will any Enron executives have a role in the combined company's senior management team?
Yes, Greg Whalley will serve as Executive Vice President and will join Dynegy's Office of the Chairman when the transaction closes.
What happens to Ken Lay?
Ken Lay will remain as Chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. He will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.
Will Enron complete its new building?
Yes.
Is Enron's vision still to be the world's leading company?
Enron's vision will be revisited once the companies are merged.
Will this affect Enron's innovation?
A key strength of Enron and Dynegy has been their employees' innovation and we expect this to continue.
What will this do to our deregulation efforts?
Both Enron and Dynegy share the belief in open markets and competition. We believe our deregulation efforts will continue.
DYNEGY ISSUES
Dynegy profile:
Dynegy Inc. is a leading energy merchant and power generator in North America, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. A Fortune 100 company, Dynegy in 2000 established its communications business, Dynegy Global Communications, which is engaged in providing network solutions and connectivity to wholesale customers worldwide..
What is ChevronTexaco's relationship to this deal?
ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion at the closing of the merger.
COMBINED
What will the new company's name be?
The combined company will retain Dynegy's name.
Who will be the CEO of the new company?
Chuck Watson, chairman and CEO of Dynegy Inc. will become the Chairman and CEO of the new entity.
Who will be president?
Steve Bergstrom, president and COO of Dynegy Inc. will become the President and COO of the new entity.
Will there be an integration team? Who will be on it?
The integration process will be focused on designing a strong and efficient organization. Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient transition. Details of the make-up of the team have not yet been determined.
Will the companies merge offices and where?
There are currently no plans to merge offices. Considering the size of a combined organization, however, office spaces will be evaluated at a later date.
COMMUNITY ISSUES
Will Enron Field be renamed?
The combined company will determine this.
Is Enron's contribution program continuing during this time?
The contributions program will still be a focus for Enron, but we have curtailed new giving for now.
What does this merger mean for Houston?
We believe that it is positive for Houston because two premier energy companies will join forces and remain in the city.
EMPLOYMENT ISSUES
Will Enron (or Dynegy) employees be laid off as a result of the merger?
The merger will be a long and complex process. Some elimination of positions is almost inevitable in this type of merger, and one of the key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure and resourcing of the merged company.
How many lay offs will there be?
Prior to the merger, we hope to address any need for employment reductions through attrition and reduced hirings. We cannot rule out involuntary separations, but we have not targeted a specific number at this time.
If I am laid off, either prior to the merger completion (or as a result of it), what will my severance package be? Will the severance plan change?
If an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern. Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts. No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.
What happens to our bonuses this year?
The 2001 bonus process will continue as usual and will be consistent with previous practice based on company and individual performance.
What will happen to my stock options?
Your vested unexercised and unvested options will be converted as follows:
The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted. Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by 0.2685 to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close. At the closing of the merger, the strike price on your Enron options will be divided by the merger ratio 0.2685 to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options.
Will there be salary adjustments as a result of the merger?
Both companies will continue our market-based approach to compensating employees. In addition, both companies have a strong pay for performance philosophy in regard to total cash compensation. Prior to the merger, there will be no changes in Enron's salary structure. Post merger, we will jointly determine our salary strategy and structure.
What will happen with benefits and retirement programs?
There are no anticipated changes to Enron benefit plans before the merger is completed. Upon completion of the merger we anticipate that there will likely be changes to ensure that one benefits strategy exists for the merged company.
Will the analyst and associate program at Enron continue?
As we bring both companies together, we will look into the possibility of combining both Dynegy's PACE program with Enron's Associate/Analyst program.

2779,"
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

comments was issued in the proceedings for the San Diego complaint and the 
LADWP complaint against El Paso.

In our comments, we briefly summarize our view of how the California natural 
gas problems developed, explain how a basis differential differs from 
transportation costs, and answer the Commission's five questions.  Our major 
points are that reimposition of the price cap will not do anything to further 
reduce natural gas costs, that the market is already responding to the 
pricing signals because several pipeline projects have been announced which 
would increase capacity into and within California, and that FERC should not 
reimpose the price caps.

have to release it to the D.C. office for filing by no later than 2:30 this

--As configured, Nolan felt that the mill could not produce 1.35 million

--The static var controller (electricity related) was struck by lightening

for spare parts, a new SVC could have been purchased.

--Nothing prevented SDI personnel from checking the engineering of the plant

Gordon went straight to the off-take agreements.? Apparently SDI had its own 
off-take agreement with Pruessag that contained the type of language which 
was described in the offering memo-- i.e., Pruessag was obligated to purchase 
a guaranteed amount of steel at certain qualities each month/year.? By 
contrast the NSM/Pruessag off-take agreement did not impose any such 
obligation on Pruessag.? (Gordon will contiue with this area tomorrow)

1.  Meeting with Alberta Department of Resource Development

Rick Shapiro, Aleck Dadson, and I met with two senior officials from the 
Alberta Department of Resource Development last week (Larry Charach, 
Executive Director, Electricity  and Stan Wenger, Assistant Deputy Minister, 
Gas & Alberta Markets) and it is our view that the ADRD is not aware of 
Project Stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by Larry 
Charach relating to our views on whether Powerex has complied with the spirit 
of the rules in Alberta. 

2. Meeting with TransAlta and Other Alberta Marketers

I attended a meeting of Alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by 
TransAlta's trading group.  TransAlta proposed the companies in attendance 
form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel (U.S. 
and Canadian) along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in 
formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market 
participants with B.C. Hydro Power Supply, B.C.Hydro Grid Operations and 
Powerex's alleged improper use of the Network Economy Tariff provisions in 
the B.C. Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff.  

The attendees at the meeting included representatives from 4 of the 5 Alberta 
PPA Buyers, namely Enron, TransCanada Power, Engage Energy, and Enmax along 
with Atco Power, PanCanadian, Duke Energy, and Aquila.  In addition, although 
Bonneville Power Administration was not in attendance it was interesting that 
TransAlta advised that BPA  shared TransAlta's concerns and was interested in 
working with this group to address these concerns.  

At the meeting TransAlta walked the group through a specific example of a 
situation that occurred in May 2000 where TransAlta alleges that both it and 
TransCanada Power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible 
transmission capacity out of Alberta by B.C. Hydro Power Supply through its 
use of the Network Economy provisions in the B.C. Hydro Wholesale 
Transmission Tariff (which has a higher priority than interruptible 
transmission) during a period when prices were considerably higher in the 
Pacific Northwest than in Alberta.  As a result of the interruption of 
TransAlta's and TransCanada's interruptible transmission reservation, 
transmission capacity between Alberta/BC border and BC/US border became 
available and was immediately acquired by B.C. Hydro Power Supply and used to 
support Powerex exports during these periods into the U.S.    TransAlta 
estimates the opportunity cost  of this curtailment to TransAlta was $2 
million.

TransAlta's frustration is no surprise to Enron Canada.  I can advise that I 
wrote a memo to John Lavorato dated March 17, 2000 in which I reviewed 
Enron's concerns regarding the behavior of B.C. Hydro Power Supply  and 
Powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by TransAlta.  The 
purpose of my memo to John L was to outline my initial thoughts on what Enron 
Canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the 
idea of proceeding with a complaint to FERC that B.C. Hydro Power Supply and 
Powerex were exercising transmission market power.   Enron Canada did not 
pursue this any further at the time.

Among the ideas reviewed by TransAlta with the group to address and rectify 
the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between Alberta and the 
U.S. Pacific Northwest included: 
 i) a complaint to ADRD and a request they become involved;
 ii) a complaint to the Alberta Market Surveillance Administrator;
 iii) a complaint to FERC;
 iv) a complaint to the BCUC;
 v) a complaint to the B.C. Government;
 vi) a complaint to the NEB;
 vii) a complaint to the Competition Bureau; and/or
 viii) a NAFTA complaint.   

With respect to TransAlta's comments relating to the Competition Bureau, they 
advised the group that they have spoken to the Competition Bureau about their 
concerns and were told by the Competition Bureau that it is monitoring the 
Alberta electricity market.   Based on the description provided by TransAlta 
of its discussions with the Competition Bureau and other comments made by 
TransAlta at the meeting I do not believe TransAlta is aware of Project 
Stanley.    I believe the comments made by the TransAlta trader Enron's 
trader last month about the Competition Bureau were not about Project Stanley 
but were in the context of TransAlta complaining to the Competition Bureau 
about B.C. Hydro Power Supply and Powerex's alleged abuse of the Network 
Economy provisions in the Tariff.  

The next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on September 11, 
2000 of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition.  The idea 
is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality 
documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may 
wish to provide relating to potential abuses by B.C. Hydro Power Supply or 
Powerex.  In addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible 
courses of action described above would be most effective.  It appears from 
the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a 
complaint to FERC is the most favored by TransAlta at this time.  Finally, 
they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which TransAlta suggested may be 
in the range of $500,000 Cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint 
to FERC.

There are without question a number of reasons why a decision that Enron 
Canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of 
the Project Stanley matter is the safest strategy.  Having said this, Enron 
Canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition (with 
or without Enron) achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate B.C. Hydro 
Power Supply's and Powerex's ability to use the Network Economy Service to 
block its competitors from access to import capacity into Alberta and export 
capacity into the U.S.   Enron Canada's recent acquisition of the Alberta 
Sundance B PPA (700 MW of capacity dispatch rights in Alberta) makes this 
issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for 
transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of 
curtailment as a result of B.C. Hydro Power Supply invoking Network Economy 
Service would represent a significant risk mitigant for Enron's Sundance B 
long position.   There is also some benefit of participating in the coalition 
to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doing.

I have discussed the matter with Rob Milnthorp and he agrees that the 
decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be 
considered and approved by those managing the Project Stanley issue.   If the 
decision of the Project Stanley team is that Enron Canada must steer clear of 
this coalition because of Project Stanley, then Rob M and other commercial 
guys in ENA who do business with Powerex will not need to give further 
consideration to additional reasons why Enron Canada may elect not 
participate such as: i) the implications on Enron Canada's and ENA's 
commercial relationship with Powerex, ii) whether Enron Canada  would be 
prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the 
coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality 
obligations, the favored course of action, and the budget,  iii) whether 
Enron Canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the 
coalition at any time, and iv) whether Enron would want to be in a coalition 
with BPA who I understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising 
transmission market power .  To complicate this further, Enron Canada is 
presently being sued by TransAlta over the interpretation of the wording in 
two swap transactions and Rob Milnthorp has indicated that Enron Canada will 
not agree to participate in any coalition with TransAlta unless and until 
TransAlta discontinues this lawsuit.  

I look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue.

Regards,

Rob

2808,"Attached is the Joint Defense Agreement from Shook, Hardy & Bacon with my 
comments in redline. This agreement was sent to us to allow Enron access to 
the Power Systems' attorney's opinion regarding whether the proposed redesign 
for the New Albany and Doyle turbines might infringe GE patents.

My comments are intended to preserve Enron's rights to bring any claims that 
it may have against Power Systems. Do we have any other agreements of this 
type with Power Systems?  Some claims that Enron may have against Power 
Systems such as claims for breach of warranty may have limitations periods 
that are approaching.  I believe we have discussed having Bracewell review 
the depositions and any documents related to the installation of the 
allegedly infringing systems into Enron's facilities.  Please advise if you 
would like for us to undertake this review and ensure that any claims that 
Enron may have are protected.

2812," Our next step is to file a pleading with the Versailles Court of Appeals, 
which puts our spin on the Court-appointed expert's report.  

 The deadline for filing our pleading is next Friday, although we need to 
file it as early next week as possible, given that this is our third 
extension of time.

 I have reviewed Bernard Mettatal's draft, had him make changes, and think we 
hit the right points.

 In short, Interfert knew the Court was going to limit its recovery to 
commissions on deals it actively participated in with EGLE, Interfert had its 
shot at producing  information to support this position to the 
Court-appointed expert, but Interfert failed to do so.  
 
 Our brief prays for recovery for all of the preliminary award made to 
Interfert of 810,000 FF, and our attorneys' fees.

 A key issue is what the Court meant when it required that Interfert be 
actively involved in the deal.  The trial judge wasn't very specific.  We say 
it means Interfert had  to bring a real deal to us, not just introduce us to 
a purchaser at lunch.  

 Importantly, I just learned that a new judge will hear this case.  We don't 
know who it will be yet; the judges in France move around quite a bit.  I've 
got my fingers  crossed that Enron will get a better shake this time around.

 Given that this matter will not be set for hearing until March 2002, we may 
get a ruling on our appeal from the French Supreme Court before then.

 Let me know what else you need from me so I can authorize Mettatal to file 
our pleading.

2814,"Some initial reactions to your questions...

The implied enterprise value at June 30 based on PPE/ENA's net purchase price 
and outstanding project-level debt was $1,457/kW; this value reflects 
fully-contracted cash flow under the terms of the existing PPA.  As a pure 
merchant plant, the value might range from $50/kW (i.e., the ""scrap value"" 
based on a view that the margins realized from running the plant are 
insufficient to warrant keeping the doors open) to $350/kW (based on a view 
that the plant runs 7x24 and achieves prices at levels forecasted by Pace 
Global Energy (Pace) in a study that we had completed to facilitate 
commercial discussions with Brazos earlier this year).

The attached slide will give you a feel for where PPA prices are relative to 
market prices, again using Pace's numbers to illustrate ""market"".  ENA's 
ERCOT 7x24 curve is probably higher at the front end and lower on the back 
end than what we see from Pace, reflecting (1) at the front end, what we're 
seeing in today's gas forward markets (i.e., higher prices than Pace predicts 
from an ""econometrics"" point of view) and (2) at the back end, lower overall 
inflation.  In general, I think it's safe to say that we see the spread 
between PPA and market prices widening, especially in light of the fact that 
current gas market conditions narrow the spread considerably during the 
period of time in which a Brazos breach is most likely.

Based on the facilitation material we've seen, it appears that Brazos will 
argue that its staff was lead to believe that Tenaska IV would earn no more 
than 20% return on equity.  However, we've always viewed this as a somewhat 
disingenuous line of argument because Brazos has gone on public record as 
saying that it looked at a number of competing solutions to meet its members' 
needs and chose the least cost alternative in contracting with Tenaska IV.  
In fact, the all-in price projections we've seen in correspondence between 
Tenaska IV and Brazos in the contracting process appear to be in line with 
actual results.  To the extent the project has earned a return in excess of 
20%, this can generally be attributed to the cost savings realized in 
construction and strict enforcement of the contract.  It's also important to 
note that Tenaska IV took on all of the development risk in this project; it 
could have easily underbudgeted costs and found itself earning significantly 
less.

See the historical perspective that follows the forward projections contained 
in the attached.  We generally agree that Brazos has not been harmed by the 
current contract to date, but is in an above-market contract on a going 
forward basis.

Brazos appears to have three options at the end of the primary term (1) walk 
away, (2) purchase the plant for PV5 of future capacity payments, or (3) live 
with the contract by paying scheduled contract prices (i.e., capacity charges 
and gas agency fees) plus operating costs.  If Brazos selects options (2) or 
(3), Tenaska IV has certain ""put-back"" rights, but the plant is generally 
Brazos' for the taking.  These provisions of the PPA should yield prices that 
are below prevailing market prices in most years (i.e., other than those in 
which major maintenance will occur) as illustrated in the attached.  
Accordingly, we view the contract as more of an ""accelerated payment plant"" 
that front end loads capital recovery to Tenaska IV.  Patton Boggs' argument 
puts a new ""spin"" on the contract structure, one that we've not heard up to 
this point.

FROM:       John Devine 
RE:     Tuesday, February 12, 2002 Fundraiser 
As your State District Court Judge, I worked hard for you and the citizens of Harris County since 1995.  Administering justice fairly and efficiently, and standing strong on the moral values our nation was founded on, has always been my priority.  I reduced the court's case backlog by more than 40 percent, was a leader in swift and fair disposition of cases, and earned the respect of many for my ""Kids in Court"" program.  As you know, whether on the bench or in the community, my commitment has always been for making Harris County safe place for honest law abiding citizens to work, live and raise a family, and that will continue to be my top priority as your Harris County Attorney. 
As your County Attorney, I pledge to continue to be the proven, principled and proactive leader I am known to be.  As the peoples' attorney, I will be your voice and advocate - protecting the law-abiding taxpayer and holding government accountable for its actions.  My commitment to these principles is unwavering. 
I respectfully ask you for your financial support at my upcoming fundraiser.  Your support of my campaign is important and much appreciated.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 713-681-1996 or via fax at 713-681-8402.

2822,"I wanted to give you an update as to the status of the NSM Cases:

1)  Farallon:  There is a signed settlement agreement in place.  (I have th=
e
plaintiffs' signature pages and am gathering the other defendants' and will
forward you a fully-executed copy when I've got it.)  However, the case has
not been dismissed yet because of two small issues, neither of which involv=
es
Enron/ECT Securities directly.  First, plaintiffs had wanted two signatures=
 from each defendant on the
Settlement Agreement.  (The California corporations code provides that a
corporation cannot claim lack of authority by signers of a document if both
the president or a vice president and the secretary, CFO or treasurer sign.=
) I've convinced them to accept one signature from ECT Securities because i=
t is
a limited partnership, so the code provision does not apply.  However, the
plaintiffs are insisting that Natwest, several of whose entities are
corporations, provide two signatures instead of only one.  I suspect the is=
sue
will be worked out this week - there is a hearing scheduled for Friday (7/2=
0)
at which the case is expected to be dismissed.

Second, several of the defendants (but not ECT Securities) have cross-claim=
s
against John Schultes that were not released in the settlement with
plaintiffs.  In negotiating to settle those claims, Schultes indicated that=
 he
wanted to be released from liability by all defendants, including ECT
Securities.  However, we have made clear to the other parties that ECT
Securities (and its affiliates) will not release any claims it may have
against Schultes (e.g., for indemnification and/or contribution with respec=
t
to our settlement amount and attorneys fees) without being released from al=
l
liability to Schultes relating to NSM - including the action he filed in Oh=
io
state court, in which he sued Enron.  The other defendants may settle with
Schultes and simply leave ECT out of it, in which case the entire Farallon
case could be dismissed, leaving Enron/ECT to deal with Schultes on our own=
. (ECT has the right to bring any indemnification or contribution claims in=
 a
separate action, so dismissal of the case would not affect its rights.)  I'=
ll
keep you updated on this - we should know more by the hearing on Friday
morning.

2)  Legg Mason.  We have a fully-executed settlement agreement.  (I'll send
you a copy later today.)  Plaintiffs expect to dismiss the case later this
week - perhaps at the hearing on Friday in Farallon.  I'll keep you updated=
.

3)  Agreement among defendants.  All defendants have signed the agreement a=
nd
releases.  I will have all signature pages today and send you a copy.

return this e-mail.

=092.  After discussion, counsel for the defendant holding companies have a=
greed to file on December 5 bare-bones motions to transfer venue to Harris =
County, with the intention of waiving them if plaintiffs appear disposed to=
 push back on them.  This is because of the problem I mentioned in my earli=

h is the proper procedural vehicle for what is essentially a Rule 12(b)(6) =
motion under the Texas Rules.  One attorney expressed concern that filing a=

2825,"I would ask Mike about the last sentence in bullet 5.  Based on the language of the quote the Commission appears to be referring to the surcharge ""adopted in D. 01-03-082.""  Was the .01 surcharge ""adopted"" in that proceeding?  Maybe I am reading this too literally.  I do agree that the rationale for exempting DA customers from the 3 cent surcharge applies equally to the 1 cent surcharge, and that we should continue to strive for this clarification at the CPUC (which Sue Mara is handling).

Here is the last draft of the responses to FERC's questions.  It is still
missing a section in response to Question 2 that Mary is drafting.  I
believe that Ron has minimized the concerns that I had from the prior draft.
He is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diego
litigation.  In response to Question No. 4, he is asking FERC to
specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers
market, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine
that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory.
Anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate
the problem.  There is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get
it, that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal
court that there has been preemption.  As a practical matter, however, our
preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to
preempt anti-trust laws, for example, the preemption argument may be
difficult to make anyway.  Ron and Mary clearly believe this is the one
chance we have to get FERC to make a finding.  If FERC does make the
finding, it will undoubtedly be appealed.  I do not know how to assess the
likelihood that FERC will make the requested finding, and if they do whether
it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit
analysis.

 If we are going to go this route, I would take out the conditional
phrase on page 7 in the word version that reads:  ""if they were not in
violation of market rules established under the ISO's and PX's tariffs.""

 Talk to you tomorrow.

ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Richard,
 I am following up on the electronic data from Tim.  Do we have any
more progress yet?

 I also met with Mike Day yesterday to discuss his views on strategy
for opposing the subpoena if it becomes necessary.  He added an important
fact.  He said that because the CPUC is a California constitutionally
created entity, they take the view that they need not go to Superior Court
for enforcement of their orders.  While Williams and others are claiming
that they should, Michael believes it much much more likely that the
procedural course will be for the ALJ to enter a decision and order which
the full Commission may but need not consider.  If the Commission does not
take up the ALJ's order, at that point, we would be left with seeking a writ
of mandate at the Court of Appeals level.  In other words, if the CPUC takes
that view, then there may be no de novo review anywhere outside of the CPUC.
This is because orders of the CPUC are only reviewable at the Court of
Appeals level.  Thus, there may be no need for the Commission to even bother
trying to find a favorable judge in San Diego since the commission already
has the contempt power.  In short, this wrinkle seems to make the ALJ
approach even less appealing than before.  Williams, however, is still
pressing apparently on the theory that the CPUC should go to Superior Court.

 Michael also had a suggestion for a back channel approach to the AG
that was raised on the governmental affairs side of the house that might be
useful to discuss next week.

Thanks

protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened 
from us in the CPUC's OII case.  Given the timing, we should discuss this on

They request that we be required:
to answer their motion on Thursday,

to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals,

We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its

prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants.

as you can, as this needs to be filed tomorrow.

was a hostile reaction to the letter Grynberg counsel had sent to Hosie on 
the subject.  For tomorrow, Eismeier wants to refrain from the high state of 
animosity that has marked prior exchanges with Hosie and so plans to file a 
motion to extend the deadline for a week to promote discussions to work 
something out.  If they don't work something out Grynberg will file something 
to demand participation.   I don't think this changes what we discussed today 
and think we should go ahead to finalize our letter.

2856," Our next step is to file a pleading with the Versailles Court of Appeals, 
which puts our spin on the Court-appointed expert's report.  

 The deadline for filing our pleading is next Friday, although we need to 
file it as early next week as possible, given that this is our third 
extension of time.

 I have reviewed Bernard Mettatal's draft, had him make changes, and think we 
hit the right points.

 In short, Interfert knew the Court was going to limit its recovery to 
commissions on deals it actively participated in with EGLE, Interfert had its 
shot at producing  information to support this position to the 
Court-appointed expert, but Interfert failed to do so.  
 
 Our brief prays for recovery for all of the preliminary award made to 
Interfert of 810,000 FF, and our attorneys' fees.

 A key issue is what the Court meant when it required that Interfert be 
actively involved in the deal.  The trial judge wasn't very specific.  We say 
it means Interfert had  to bring a real deal to us, not just introduce us to 
a purchaser at lunch.  

 Importantly, I just learned that a new judge will hear this case.  We don't 
know who it will be yet; the judges in France move around quite a bit.  I've 
got my fingers  crossed that Enron will get a better shake this time around.

 Given that this matter will not be set for hearing until March 2002, we may 
get a ruling on our appeal from the French Supreme Court before then.

 Let me know what else you need from me so I can authorize Mettatal to file 
our pleading.

 Thanks.

direction and supervision.  Matt Lee, ECT's in-house attorney in Singapore, 
will set up a telephone conference with you and Neale for some time tomorrow, 
prior to opening of business in Houston.  In case you need to get in touch 
with him, the telephone number I use for Matt is 65-838-9103   I believe 
Neal's number is 65-532-5335.  I will call you tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. London 
time, 9:00 a.m. Houston time, to touch base with you.

FACTS
   
 The following is a thumbnail of the facts that have been reported to me.  I 
have not had a chance to run this summary past Matt, and would be grateful 
for any corrections he might like to make.  

 ECT purchased a quantity of ""Elang Crude, suitable for export"" from Phillips 
Petroleum Company (""Phillips""), and voyage-chartered the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO 
from Mitsubishi Corporation (""Mitsubishi""),the time-charterer, to carry it 
from Phillips' offshore loading facility in Indonesia to Thailand and the 
Phillipines for use by the buyer, First Gas Power Corporation (""FGPC""), as 
compressor fuel.  There exists a long-term compressor fuel agreement between 
ECT and FGPC that contains several specifications that the product needed to 
pass.  The agreement between ECT and Phillips does not mention any of these 
specifications.    

 One of the specifications at issue from the ECT/FGPC agreement is  ASTM D 
3605, which is used to test for the presence of certain metals.  According to 
ECT's surveyors, ASTM D 3605 apparently does not produce test results that 
are sufficiently reproducible to be useful.  ECT has apparently been trying 
for some months to convince FGPC of this, but without success.  FGPC 
reportedly advises that Seimens, from whom it purchased the compressors at 
issue, might void its warranty to FGPC if fuel is used that does not meet 
ASTM D 3605.  
 
 A separate specification from the ECT/FGPC agreement, for sediments, may 
also become at issue.  Months before the product at issue was loaded, ECT had 
Elang Crude from this same facility tested to determine whether it would meet 
the FGPC specifications, and found that the Elang Crude was on-spec for ASTM 
D 3605, but off-spec for sedimentation (again, a test separate and apart from 
ASTM D 3605) by almost double the allowed amount.  It is not clear why ECT 
decided to purchase  product from Phillips despite this test.  It is unknown 
at this time whether this test included any of the product later loaded.   
 
 At some point prior to loading, ECT did put the ship on notice that the 
cargo had to meet specifications for use as compressor fuel.  The ship 
responded by recommending that the tanks be Butterworthed, at an extra cost 
(per the C/P) to ECT of $30,000.  ECT declined, apparently opting for a less 
expensive fresh water rinse. Reportedly, the ship then advised that it did 
not have sufficient fresh water to perform a fresh water (as opposed to 
seawater) rinse.  I am not sure what tank cleaning ultimately took place, or 
who paid for it.  SGS, ECT's surveyors, did deliver a dry certificate to us 
before loading. 
 
 The ship loaded 659,133 bbls. (per B/L) at the MODEC Venture 1, Phillips' 
floating offshore facility in Indonesia, from June 20-21.  Testing of the 
shore tanks  at loading revealed that the Elang Crude did meet the 
specifications in the FGPC contract.  ECT paid Phillips an FOB price of $20, 
706,663.20 for the cargo.  

 After loading in Indonesia, the ship then proceeded to Thailand, where from 
June 28-30 it  off-loaded 410,697 bbls for storage, for the eventual use of 
FGPC.  No quality testing of the product was apparently done aboard or ashore 
at that time.  The ship thereafter sailed to the Phillipines for off-loading 
the remainder of the cargo.

 Upon off-loading in the Phillipines, the cargo was found off-spec for the 
presence of metals and sediment.  FGPC rejected the cargo; Wilson, Farley 
opined that FGPC was squarely within its contractual rights to do so.  ECT 
placed all potentially liable parties on notice and resold the cargo 
remaining on board to LG Caltex (""Caltex""), reportedly a Korean refinery, on 
a CIF outturn basis, for what I understand to be only a small (approximately 
$300,00) reduction in the value of the cargo.  

 ECT will not know exactly what it will be paid by the Korean refinery until 
the end of August, as the purchase was based on an August price index.  That 
cargo discharged in Korea and received by Caltex directly into its crude oil 
storage facility on July 26.  It appears that Caltex did not do any quality 
inspection before this occurred.  No protest or objection to the quality of 
the cargo has been received from Caltex.

 ECT is attempting to find another buyer for the Elang Crude currently in 
storage in Thailand, as it is apparently unsuitable for FGPC's use there as 
well.  Matt will know whether that product has been tendered to and rejected 
by FGPC.

  Mitsubishi has tendered an invoice for approximately $500,00 freight for 
the voyage from the Phillipines to Korea, and has submitted an invoice for 
approximately $250,000 for demurrage for the voyage from Indonesia to the 
Phillipines.  ECT has already paid approximately $790,000 freight for the 
voyage from Indonesia to the Phillipines.  Parenthetically, two different 
charter parties were used: one for the voyage from Indonesia to the 
Phillipines, and one for the voyage from the Phillipines to Korea.  

 A number of samples of the cargo were taken at the MODEC Venture 1,  in 
Thailand, and the Phillipines, at surveys that appear to have been jointly 
attended by ECT, ECT's cargo underwriters, and Owners/P&I.  As I understand 
it, the reports of the various analyses done to date are somewhat confusing.  
A joint analysis is being planned to take place in Singapore.  Unfortunately, 
the seals on a number of samples were broken by SGS, our surveyors; however, 
my hope is that there are a number of other samples that can serve the same 
purpose.  

 ECT has also retained a Captain Sawant of PacMarine to act as an independent 
expert for us in this matter.  Captain Sawant has prepared a report and there 
is a Watson, Farley memo containing notes of an interview of him.  As I 
understand his report, Captain Sawant believes that the contamination 
probably took place aboard ship, as a result of (a) inadequate cleaning of 
the tanks and (b) the cleansing properties of this condensate cargo.

 A related issue of great importance to ECT is FGPC's position going forward 
regarding what I understand to be a long-term compressor fuel purchase 
agreement.  Under the agreement, there are reportedly three alternative fuels 
which ECT may, given certain conditions, deliver to FGPC: condensate, 
gas/oil, and naptha.  Condensate is apparently the first choice, but must 
meet ASTM D 3605, which ECT now feels is extremely difficult to do, given the 
unreliability of the test.  Gas/oil can reportedly only be used where ECT has 
been unable, despite the use of due diligence, to locate condensate that 
meets ASTM D 3605.  If FGPC accepts gas/oil as a substitute, however, then 
FGPC is responsible for paying a substantial tax on it that does not apply to 
condensate.  Naptha will reportedly cause ECT to lose money, because of its 
lower Btu content.  

 Because of the problems with the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO product, ECT has 
reportedly contacted FGPC about accepting gas/oil as a substitute.  I have 
heard that this will cause FGPC to become liable for a tax in the range of 
$1,000,000, although this has not been confirmed.  Before agreeing to accept 
gas/oil, FGPC has requested a letter advising what due diligence efforts ECT 
has performed in order to secure product that does meet its specs.

 Parenthetically, I ask that Matt remind me who the ECT trader was who 
actually did this deal.  

URGENT  ISSUES   

1.  Who to use as ECT's experts.  Neale has recommended Captain Richard 
Gregory of Noble, Denton and Dr. Eric Mullen of Burgoynes.  I do not know 
whether Neale intends to use Captain Sawant, who has reportedly never 
testified.  I feel that the quality of ECT's experts will be of great 
significance in this case and want to make sure that whoever we use can, in 
your opinion, command the respect of a London arbitration tribunal in a 
proceeding against the ship or, if necessary, against the cargo underwriters. 
 If that means getting a London-based expert, let's discuss it and get this 
issue resolved before the joint survey that is being scheduled to take place 
in the Phillipines.

2.    Resolving ECT's insurance claim.  As you know, Cliff Bennett of 
Minton's (the same firm that Enron is using as its experts in the M/V HAVMANN 
matter) is following this matter for ECT's cargo underwriters.  I am told 
that Bennett has not been told by us about the pre-sale product sampling.  My 
concern is that once he finds out, he (and the ship) will raise inherent vice 
as a defense.  Please take a look at the cargo policy that I will be sending 
you by courier and (a) advise of any coverage issues you see and (b) give us 
your thoughts as to the best way of resolving ECT's claim quickly. 

3.   Whether ECT should file for arbitration before the ship does so.  You 
mentioned that the ship is likely to file an arbitration demand in the near 
future and seek an interim award of its $510,000 freight claim.  Given that, 
I would like your recommendation in very short order as to whether ECT should 
wait for that to happen and file a counterclaim, or proceed with filing an 
original demand.

4.   Whether ECT can raise the doctrines of impossibility of performance or 
frustration of performance or some other legal theory to challenge the use by 
FGPC of the ASTM D 3605 specification in this matter.

ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION

 This afternoon, I will be faxing certain key documents to you, and will send 
the rest by courier.  I am also asking that Matt telefax to you copies of the 
following documents (Matt, I apologize if you have already sent them to me):

1.  ECT's purchase agreement with Phillips

2.  ECT's long-term agreement to supply fuel to FGPC, and purchase orders (or 
the like) that particularly relate to this cargo.

3.  A copy of the first charter party, as soon as it is sent to us.

4.  Anything which reflects the terms of the second charter party.


 David, we appreciate your availability and look forward to working with you.

2860,"Here is another email about theTrust's damage theories about which I wrote
in an earlier email.  YOu may want to print this out until you get through
the 3-4 emails I""m forwarding to you about this subject.  Thanks.
",,,theTrust
2861,"This email updates you on the joint defense conference call and the issues
related to the September 19th hearing.  It is long, so you may want to print 
it
out and read a hard copy.

Your suggestion of following the joint defense discussion of what they'll
discuss with the court on September 19th was a good one.  Although I think the
general direction of the joint defense group is sound, it may be in EPMI's 
best
interest to have counsel there (even if it is local counsel so that we can 
avoid
travel expenses at this point).

Consistent with what the Bankruptcy Court has stated on the record and based
upon more recent conversations with his former law clerk, the Judge would like
to resolve at the hearing whether the parties are willing to go to mediation 
and
whether there is agreement to appoint a special discovery master to handle the
myriad of discovery disputes that have already arisen and that are certain to
multiply as the cases move forward.  From listening to the defense counsel who
have appeared before the judge in this case, it is clear that this judge does
not want to decide anything, is loath to try these cases, and promises to give
only 1 day a month for any trial, let alone the 15 trials that would be
necessary to hear these cases if they don't settle.  The judge will not 
consider
summary judgments and he is held in low regard by the defense group.

The big players on the joint defense team very much want the equivalent of a
special discovery master, but they want the powers defined more broadly so 
that
the master can make recommendations to the judge of how to try these cases if
they go to trial (e.g., bifurcation of factual and legal issues to resolve
before full trial on the merits, order in which the cases will go to trial,
etc.).  The recommendation of the rest of the joint defense group is to ask 
that
a special pre-trial master be appointed to resolve discovery disputes and make
recommendations to the bankruptcy judge for further proceedings, including
trial.  Each defendant would be able to go to mediation whenever it feels it 
has
enough discovery, but the majority of the defense group did not want to ask 
for
the appointment of a settlement mediator at this time.

Although there was not complete consensus, the majority view was to propose 
that
the costs of the special master be split evenly among all the parties.  There
are approximately 12-15 adversaries on file, and counsel representing more 
than
one defendant were already arguing that they should only be treated as only 
one
party given how closely aligned their defenses and interests are.  Further,
although most of the defense group feels that the trust should be required to
pay its share as 1 party, many are willing to withdraw that requirement and 
let
the trust get a free ride if the trustee objects to the proposal (thereby
isolating the trustee and making him look foolish).

I raise this in detail because of my concern that EPMI, with much cleaner and
stronger defenses, may end carrying more of the expense freight than it 
should.
Given that everyone envisions that this pretrial mediator will have his or her
hands full, the expense of even 1/15 of that could add up quickly.  My
suggestion is that the plaintiff or particular defendant who files the 
discovery
dispute pays for the time the pretrial master spends resolving it.  For 
matters
involving all defendants, then the costs be split evenly.  My further
suggestion, echoing what ya'll said on our last conference call, is to try to
position this case for settlement as soon as possible so that the expenses do
not mount by virtue of the morass of the rest of the litigation against
defendants who did not terminate their contracts.

The next issue is whether to attend the hearing on the 19th.  The order 
setting
the hearing was finally entered on September 6th.  Elizabeth Austin --
recommended local counsel (see previous emails) -- was kind enough to send me 
a
copy.  The Order requires that the hearing be attended by ""all counsel for all
Defendants in the pending adversary proceedings.""  Counsel are further 
required
to have full authorization to resolve any issue arising at the status 
conference
and ""shall be either accompanied by the person or persons authorized and
competent to accept or reject the resolution of such issues or such persons
shall be available by telephone.""

Further, the docket reflects that a pretrial order is due in our case by
September 13!!! This is an special animal of the local rules and is not the
typical pretrial order.  It only requires that parties states whether they 
agree
that the case is a core or non-core proceeding, set forth the answer or 
response
date, and set forth the  proposed length for discovery.  The plaintiff is
responsible for contacting the defendant to reach agreement on the pretrial
order.  To date, I assume that you've received no calls or correspondence from
Kaye Scholer about this.  In another adversary filed against El Paso about the
same time that the case against Enron was filed, the trustee has already
unilaterally filed a motion to extend the deadline for filing the pretrial.
I'll check the docket again on Monday to see if such an extension motion was
filed in our adversary.  If we are contacted by the trustee counsel between 
now
and the 13th, it will take all of about 15 minutes to prepare the pretrial
order.

Again, this is a long way of saying that, although we are not obligated to do
anything about the pretrial order, especially since we haven't yet received a
copy of the complaint, we do have actual knowledge of the proceedings, we have
joined the defense group, and we may get off to a bad start if we don't attend
the hearing and then try to argue that we don't want some part of the order
entered to apply to us.  If I were the judge, my first question would be ""why
weren't you here on the 19th so that you could have objected then.""  To 
respond
that we didn't think we had to because we had not yet received a copy of the
complaint in the mail may not endear us to the judge if he presses us to find
out what we actually knew about the hearing.

My recommendation is that either local counsel or I attend the hearing, even
though I'd love to avoid the cost altogether.  There is a joint defense 
meeting
the night before and the morning of the status hearing where the group is 
going
to further attempt to reach agreement among themselves as to how they're going
to propose to handle discovery and legal issues assuming that a pretrial 
master
is appointed.  If you decide that I don't need to go, I would recommend that 
our
local counsel attend if we have retained him or her by then.  If it is 
Elizabeth
Austin, I have confidence that she will adequately protect Enron's interests,
especially given her prior involvement in the case.  If counsel for EPMI 
attends
the hearing, then you, Elizabeth, or Jeff should be reachable by phone in case
something comes up that we need authorization for.

We have another joint defense conference call set up for Wednesday, Sept. 13 
at
1:00 pm.  By that time, a draft of the proposed order for the pretrial master
will be circulated with the proposed sharing of costs provisions.  If we are
going to object to an equal sharing for all work performed by the pretrial
master, I should advise the group on Wednesday in this call.
If we aren't able to get this case settled relatively quickly, there will be a
great deal of benefit by being a member of the joint defense group, especially
with regard to establishing other grounds for termination of the transactions
and fighting the trustee's damage calculations.  In determining the 
appropriate
settlement amount (reduction of EPMI's proof of claim)  we should be cognizant
that the costs of the defense may be higher than it would otherwise be if this
were the only pending litigation involving this kind of claim.

I look forward to your response.  I will be in town all of next week, so call 
at
your convenience.

Please note: I have not sent this memo to GPC.   

1.  Meeting with Alberta Department of Resource Development

Rick Shapiro, Aleck Dadson, and I met with two senior officials from the 
Alberta Department of Resource Development last week (Larry Charach, 
Executive Director, Electricity  and Stan Wenger, Assistant Deputy Minister, 
Gas & Alberta Markets) and it is our view that the ADRD is not aware of 
Project Stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by Larry 
Charach relating to our views on whether Powerex has complied with the spirit 
of the rules in Alberta. 

2. Meeting with TransAlta and Other Alberta Marketers

I attended a meeting of Alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by 
TransAlta's trading group.  TransAlta proposed the companies in attendance 
form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel (U.S. 
and Canadian) along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in 
formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market 
participants with B.C. Hydro Power Supply, B.C.Hydro Grid Operations and 
Powerex's alleged improper use of the Network Economy Tariff provisions in 
the B.C. Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff.  

The attendees at the meeting included representatives from 4 of the 5 Alberta 
PPA Buyers, namely Enron, TransCanada Power, Engage Energy, and Enmax along 
with Atco Power, PanCanadian, Duke Energy, and Aquila.  In addition, although 
Bonneville Power Administration was not in attendance it was interesting that 
TransAlta advised that BPA  shared TransAlta's concerns and was interested in 
working with this group to address these concerns.  

At the meeting TransAlta walked the group through a specific example of a 
situation that occurred in May 2000 where TransAlta alleges that both it and 
TransCanada Power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible 
transmission capacity out of Alberta by B.C. Hydro Power Supply through its 
use of the Network Economy provisions in the B.C. Hydro Wholesale 
Transmission Tariff (which has a higher priority than interruptible 
transmission) during a period when prices were considerably higher in the 
Pacific Northwest than in Alberta.  As a result of the interruption of 
TransAlta's and TransCanada's interruptible transmission reservation, 
transmission capacity between Alberta/BC border and BC/US border became 
available and was immediately acquired by B.C. Hydro Power Supply and used to 
support Powerex exports during these periods into the U.S.    TransAlta 
estimates the opportunity cost  of this curtailment to TransAlta was $2 
million.

TransAlta's frustration is no surprise to Enron Canada.  I can advise that I 
wrote a memo to John Lavorato dated March 17, 2000 in which I reviewed 
Enron's concerns regarding the behavior of B.C. Hydro Power Supply  and 
Powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by TransAlta.  The 
purpose of my memo to John L was to outline my initial thoughts on what Enron 
Canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the 
idea of proceeding with a complaint to FERC that B.C. Hydro Power Supply and 
Powerex were exercising transmission market power.   Enron Canada did not 
pursue this any further at the time.

Among the ideas reviewed by TransAlta with the group to address and rectify 
the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between Alberta and the 
U.S. Pacific Northwest included: 
 i) a complaint to ADRD and a request they become involved;
 ii) a complaint to the Alberta Market Surveillance Administrator;
 iii) a complaint to FERC;
 iv) a complaint to the BCUC;
 v) a complaint to the B.C. Government;
 vi) a complaint to the NEB;
 vii) a complaint to the Competition Bureau; and/or
 viii) a NAFTA complaint.   

With respect to TransAlta's comments relating to the Competition Bureau, they 
advised the group that they have spoken to the Competition Bureau about their 
concerns and were told by the Competition Bureau that it is monitoring the 
Alberta electricity market.   Based on the description provided by TransAlta 
of its discussions with the Competition Bureau and other comments made by 
TransAlta at the meeting I do not believe TransAlta is aware of Project 
Stanley.    I believe the comments made by the TransAlta trader Enron's 
trader last month about the Competition Bureau were not about Project Stanley 
but were in the context of TransAlta complaining to the Competition Bureau 
about B.C. Hydro Power Supply and Powerex's alleged abuse of the Network 
Economy provisions in the Tariff.  

The next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on September 11, 
2000 of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition.  The idea 
is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality 
documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may 
wish to provide relating to potential abuses by B.C. Hydro Power Supply or 
Powerex.  In addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible 
courses of action described above would be most effective.  It appears from 
the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a 
complaint to FERC is the most favored by TransAlta at this time.  Finally, 
they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which TransAlta suggested may be 
in the range of $500,000 Cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint 
to FERC.

There are without question a number of reasons why a decision that Enron 
Canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of 
the Project Stanley matter is the safest strategy.  Having said this, Enron 
Canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition (with 
or without Enron) achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate B.C. Hydro 
Power Supply's and Powerex's ability to use the Network Economy Service to 
block its competitors from access to import capacity into Alberta and export 
capacity into the U.S.   Enron Canada's recent acquisition of the Alberta 
Sundance B PPA (700 MW of capacity dispatch rights in Alberta) makes this 
issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for 
transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of 
curtailment as a result of B.C. Hydro Power Supply invoking Network Economy 
Service would represent a significant risk mitigant for Enron's Sundance B 
long position.   There is also some benefit of participating in the coalition 
to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doing.

I have discussed the matter with Rob Milnthorp and he agrees that the 
decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be 
considered and approved by those managing the Project Stanley issue.   If the 
decision of the Project Stanley team is that Enron Canada must steer clear of 
this coalition because of Project Stanley, then Rob M and other commercial 
guys in ENA who do business with Powerex will not need to give further 
consideration to additional reasons why Enron Canada may elect not 
participate such as: i) the implications on Enron Canada's and ENA's 
commercial relationship with Powerex, ii) whether Enron Canada  would be 
prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the 
coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality 
obligations, the favored course of action, and the budget,  iii) whether 
Enron Canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the 
coalition at any time, and iv) whether Enron would want to be in a coalition 
with BPA who I understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising 
transmission market power .  To complicate this further, Enron Canada is 
presently being sued by TransAlta over the interpretation of the wording in 
two swap transactions and Rob Milnthorp has indicated that Enron Canada will 
not agree to participate in any coalition with TransAlta unless and until 
TransAlta discontinues this lawsuit.  

I look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue.

Regards,

Rob

2863,"Richard,  my comments on the August 10 PX letter, having participated in th=
e August 13 and September 5 prehearing conferences:

Cal PX has always asserted its neutrality in the prehearing conferences in =
the CA proceeding.  Although this assertion is only partially true, I think=
 we would be barking up the wrong tree if we were to pursue the PX, given S=
teve's correct assessment that the PX is judgment proof.=20

My comments regarding the numbered paragraphs of the letter:

1.=09Regarding confidentiality, there is a protective order (as amended) in=
 place.  Despite this, my educated guess is that the protective order could=
 very well be lifted given the rather political nature of the proceeding.  =
Judge Birchman alluded to this possibility just yesterday at the prehearing=
 conference.  He has also previously expressed a belief that the conduct of=
 the proceeding could be hampered if each party's refund data is deemed to =
be confidential.  In short, I believe there will be less confidentiality ra=
ther than more.

2.-3.=09The PX is severely resource constrained.  Additionally the PX must =
await the ISO data before it can start generating the data that the PX itse=
lf needs to produce.  As of yesterday, the PX did not have all the ISO data=
, and the data they did receive from ISO was riddled with errors.  This gav=
e rise to the one month delay in the hearing schedule that the Judge ordere=
d yesterday.  As to the $150 breakpoint issue, I understand that it should =
not be as difficult to calculate as the PX purports, but the PX truly is un=
derstaffed and has virtually no funds.  In any case, this probably is a moo=
t issue since the Judge determined in the August 13 prehearing conference t=
hat the $150 breakpoint issue is pending before the Commission, probably sh=
ouldn't be dealt with in this proceeding and should be disposed of by stipu=
lation.  The parties are given about a week to agree on a draft stipulation=
 by the 12th on this and other ""threshold"" issues, failing which the Judge =
will decide the stipulation issue after oral argument on the morning of 9/1=
7.  Bottom line now on when the PX is to submit its data per the amended he=
aring schedule- 10/19.

4.=09Refund implementation procedures have not received much consideration =
as of yet.  Of course, our position is that we net our purchases and sales;=
 not pay in and then expect to be allocated a refund.  Interestingly, the l=
etter at 4b. foretold the finding of the Judge in the August 13 conference =
that refunds and offsets need to be fully a part of this proceeding and the=
 findings that he must certify to the Commission (as opposed to a matter to=
 be taken care of outside the hearing room by compliance filing).  I am loo=

	We learned from Bob today that the AG, in an apparent address our
objection to the lack of personal service, served EES's designated agent for
service of process by hand on May 27 with a subpoena for documents identical
to that served by mail on EES on May 25. Although we have not yet seen it,
we are told the subpoena has a response date of June 29. We recommend
treating this service as a withdrawal of the May 25 subpoena and responding
to it as we did to the earlier subpoena served by mail. Assuming this
subpoena is treated as a discovery subpoena under California law it is
technically defective since it does not allow ten days for a response. We
recommend additionally objecting to it on this basis.
	Attached are draft responses which implement this approach. We
propose to serve them by hand tomorrow.

Here is my report, attached as a word document, on my recent meetings with
EES employees, Jubran Whalon, Neil Bresnan, Dennis Benevides, Jay Lewis, and
Scott Stoness in Houston. A  description of their account of the documents
in Houston which appear to be called for by the AG's subpena to EES follows
in the text of this e-mail:

 Discussion of Specific Document Requests

No 1.  All contracts for retail sale:  These are both in California and
Houston.
Nos. 2 and 3:  All contracts under which EES has purchased electricity on
the western interconnection between 1998 and the end of 2003:  About five
percent of these contracts are for green power made with various entities.
The vast majority, approximately 95%, are contracts with EPMI, which
purchased all electricity load for EES.  There may be also a few contracts
with APX.  EES has paper fax copies of all these deals.  Their understanding
is that EPMI charged EES exactly what the utilities would have paid on the
California market.  While they do not know how EPMI actually provided for
the power, they believe EPMI probably did not buy most of it on the
California market.  They believe all these contracts are voidable if they
are revealed to any third party.  They characterize all this information as
extremely sensitive.  They believe with this information, if given enough
time and a few other variables, parties could construct Enron's price
curves.
No. 4.  Documents which identify the purchases of EES for power in the day
ahead, hour ahead, or real time markets operated by the PX or Cal ISO:  They
say there are none.  EES was a scheduling coordinator, but never used the
function.
No. 5.  Documents relating to portfolio of energy supply sources relied upon
EES to meet contractual obligations to NU's customers in California:  There
are no such documents.
No. 6.  Documents relating to the assessment of risks regarding:  the cost
of purchasing electricity in California:  They do not believe there are such
documents, but there may be presentations on this issue.
No. 7.  Documents relating to strategies or business plans designed to
minimize risks with regard to the cost of purchasing electricity necessary
to serve customers:  All EES officers and traders receive daily reports to
corporate goals for EES and show how EES was performing in conformity with
these goals.  They characterized these documents as extremely sensitive.
They use these on a daily basis.  Most of these goals are based upon the
price curves.  They also receive month end reports which show how each
division is doing according to these corporate goals.  They believe that a
corporate function called Risk Control would have custody of these reports.
Vladimir Gorny (sp?) was said to be the person in charge of these.
No. 8.  Documents relating to decisions to return direct access customers to
default utility distributors in California, including documents relating to
cost savings:  They believe these documents exist in Houston.  They believe
there are spreadsheets which show the cost savings or revenue enhancements
that EES would have received as a result of returning customers to
utilities.  They believe Don Black would have these.  They believe all these
documents would reveal price curves.
No. 9.  Communications relating to the return of direct access customers in
California:  There may be spreadsheets which exist on this subject:  They
believe that Don Black would have them.
No. 10.  Documents sufficient to identify persons most knowledgeable about
decisions made to return direct access customers in California:  These would
be the same documents as No. 9.
No. 11.  Documents related to the assessment of the dramatic increases in
electricity in California:  They don't know if these documents exist or not.
There may be some presentations on the subject.
No. 12.  All documents relating to strategy and business plans designed to
maximize revenues from the sale of electricity in California:  They construe
this request to refer to origination documents.  These would be with the
person that was in charge of selling services in California during the
period in question.  They believe Doug Condon (sp?) or Harold Buchanan would
have these documents.
No. 13.  Documents that show sales to California Department of Water
Resources:  They don't believe there are such documents.
Nos. 14, 15.  Contracts obligating them to either supply or purchase
electricity which they prematurely terminated:  They don't believe there are
any contracts which they prematurely terminated.  Some contracts were
terminated but by agreement.  The only possible exception may be the
University of California contract.
No. 16.  Organizational charts which show the persons with authority for
risk management.  They believe Dave Delaney or Marty Sunde, Vice Chairman of
EES, might have such charts.
No. 17.  Documents relating to risk management of trading activities on
California markets for electricity or natural gas and pipeline capacity:
These again may be guidelines which Delaney or Sunde might have.
No. 18.  Organizational charts regarding those who have responsibility for
approving charters and objectives for making risk management decisions:
They believe Jess Hewitt's department might have these.  They believe these
refer to risk management procedures to prevent conflict of interest among
EES traders.
No. 19.  Documents relating to development approval of charters and
objectives for making risk management decisions:  They believe there is a
master agreement on this subject.  They believe Rick Byers (sp?) might have
this agreement.  They also believe this request refers to guidelines
regarding conflict of interest for traders under their risk management
policies.
Nos. 20, 21.  Documents which identify financial and ownership positions of
natural gas or capacity to deliver and transport natural gas to California:
Gas contracts are handled by a different department at EES.  They believe
that some of these gas contracts were purchased by EPMI, but had no direct
knowledge of them.  They believe EES may have purchased its own gas or
pipeline capacity because EES has the necessary credit to accomplish this.
EES had its own power desk that scheduled gas.  However, they probably
purchased most of it from Enron North America.

Here is information from John Shelk of our  D.C. office on the liklihood of price caps.  The ""news"" about the market curves falling (which makes caps pointless) is starting to filter out.  However, in the mean time, the basic buzz is that increased power from the Dems in D.C. will likely lead to a vote for price caps and, if nothing else, increased pressure on FERC to ""do more"" than what it has already adopted on April 26.  ""Doing more"" could mean WSCC wide caps, caps on all hours (not just emergencies), or both.

While recent events have dramatically impacted Enron's travel volume,
Alliance Worldwide (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) wanted to contact
you regarding the Enron Travel Program.  Since 1984, our company has been a
strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket.

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $2207 international (after discounts). Enron's average savings
are $144 domestic and $587 international (before fees).  The savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee!

If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online, you may continue to
do so by booking through ClickTrip.  ClickTrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to Enron's negotiated discounts.  Ticketing through
ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of $15 if no agent assistance is
necessary.  There is no charge to look at schedules.   ClickTrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through Enron's intranet site
<http://travel.enron.com> or via the Internet site
<http://www.resassist.com/enron/>.  ClickTrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status.  To check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary, simply click the Check My Trip
button on the ClickTrip home page and fill in your name and Amadeus locator
number (provided at the top of your itinerary).  A user log-in may be
obtained by contacting Alliance at 713 328-5100.

If your office location, phone number or any profile information has
changed, please notify us by return email.  A profile form is attached if
you prefer to fax the information to Alliance at 713 328-5600 or if you are
a new traveler wishing to set up a profile.

We at Alliance are proud of our 17 year association with Enron and dedicated
to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price
for all of your travel needs.  We have a highly trained and experienced
staff working on Enron's account and we look forward to providing you with
continued service for years to come.

The gas prices so far for Oct. look higher going to Cal. border.  We will have to see if we have the volumes next week to 
run the pigs.  Sure would have been nice to have run pigs this week everyone could see that flows were up and we should
have taken advantage of this.  Again, we will take a look at all scenario's next week.

2983,"Hi Jim.  

We have narrowed our choice of vehicles to two minivans: a Toyota Sienna and
a Chrysler Town & Country. 

Surprisingly, Ben helped us eliminate SUV's from consideration. He prefers
the smoother ride of the minivan. It will be better for taking long trips.
The down side is he doesn't want to be seen driving a minivan once he turns
16. Ha! : ) 

We were able to help satisfy Anna (and Ben) by choosing a higher-end minivan that has
many ""bells and whistles"" on it, yet still costs less than an SUV.

We are leaning toward the Toyota, even though it is a bit smaller than the
Chrysler, because of its reliability and how it holds its resale value. The
Toyota dealer also has ""$300 over invoice"" sale on currently. Plus they told
Mark there will be additional financing incentives starting this Saturday.
Both the Toyota and Chrysler dealers have vehicles in inventory we can
choose from. 

So, we hope to close the deal with the Toyota dealer this coming Saturday.
What do you think?

Love,
Linda

PS  We got a pkg. in the mail today from you.  Thanks!!  I will wait until the kids are here to open it.

I'm totally open to whatever works best for you, truly.? That would be fun to 
have all day Saturday, and I'm really not worried about leaving you a key 
under the door mat or waking up to greet you- we can work it out.? Whenever 
you want to leave on Sunday is fine with me, too.? I'm not doing much to help 
you make a decision, I know, but I want you to do whatever is easiest and 
most comfortable for you.? I remember you having to get up at the crack of 
smack to come out here on Saturday; sometimes it's easiest to stay up later 
rather than getting up earlier!? I have virtually no plans that weekend now, 
so I'll start thinking about what fun events are occurring that weekend....We 
should go out downtown to the Gaslamp quarter, too, since we didn't get to do 
that last time.? We'll plan on Saturday evening for that.? I'll gather some 
friends....

Hope you're having a good day!

2992,"Hey Wilson,

Yep, I'm still in Houston for the time being...I'll probably be here through 
March of next year when my current rotation ends.  Everything's going pretty 
well, work is still consisting of long hours but I think ultimately the hard 
work is going to pay off.  In fact, the whole London thing is looking pretty 
good right now.  There might be an opportunity for me to get into some 
structuring and originating roles over there which is much more along the 
lines of where I'd like to go (versus this whole trader support thing - great 
experience for the time being, but definitely not a permanent role).  Glad to 
hear things are still well with you.  Sounds like you're still the same old 
Wilson...working deals and hooking-up.  You'll have to let me know when 
you're going to be in town so we can get the gang together to go out.  It 
looks like Darren's going to be back in town for about 6 weeks or so coming 
up so hopefully we could all make a steak night reunion.  

I've been going out quite a bit as well and have had a couple dates, but 
nothing really to speak of.  I was kind of on a rampage over the last month 
just messing with guys heads (flirting, getting them to buy me drinks, giving 
them my number and then completely ignoring them).  I think it was some need 
I had to treat your entire gender like shit.  I'm pretty much over it 
though.  It's not really in my nature to be like that, just a reactionary 
thing for having been treated like crap myself.  

Keep in touch and let me know when you're going to be in town.

2995,"On April 9, 1999 the D.C. Circuit remanded FERC's dismissal of a Southern 
California Edison complaint alleging that SoCalGas had abused its market 
power in the secondary release market for pipeline capacity.  The Commission 
had decided that SoCal's compliance with the maximum tariff rate made any 
inquiry into such issues unnecessary and dismissed the complaint.  The Court 
concluded that the Commission's refusal to examine the market power issues 
raised by Edison was arbitrary and capricious, in view of the CPUC approved 
Interstate Transportation Cost Surcharge that permits SoCal to recover the 
difference between the price it paid for contracted interstate capacity and 
the price it received for release of any such capacity.  On March 30, 2000, 
the Commission issued a request that the parties file comments on the issues,

this proceeding.  Initial comments should be filed within 60 days (May 30).  ",,,the D.C. Circuit FERC Southern California Edison SoCal Commission Edison CPUC

beginning with next week AWAD will go out five days a week.

Thanks to everyone for taking the time to voice your opinion. Your love and
concern shows--a good number of people sent their votes for five to indicate
that we, the people at Wordsmith, should take some time off.

Here are some selections from the comments that came with the ballots.

   In the Middle East, Thursday and Friday are the weekend. Here in New
   Zealand, our Monday is your (North American) Sunday. The ""weekend""
   therefore stretches from Thursday to Monday. Seen from a global

   ubiquitous as English) the issue is therefore meaningless. Regards,

   The principle of noninjury to living beings.

[Sanskrit ahimsa : a-, not + himsa, injury (from himsati, he injures).]

   ""As my conception of Ahimsa went on maturing, I became more vigilant
   about my thought and speech. The lines in the Anthem:
       Scatter her enemies
       And make them fall;
       Confound their policies,
       Frustrate their knavish tricks
   particularly jarred upon my sentiments of Ahimsa.""
   M.K. Gandhi, The Story of My Experiments With Truth, 1927.

Today is October 2, the day Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in the year
1869. A man born some two centuries ago may appear irrelevant to our age,
but in reality his life and message are still applicable to our lives today.
As opposed to being a tale of great achievements, as most autobiographies
are, his `Story of My Experiments With Truth' is a collection of
introspections and experiences in his search for truth. ""Let us not reduce
the standards of truth even by a hair's breadth for judging erring mortals
like myself,"" he writes in the introduction.

In a world where success is measured by what kind of car one drives, how
lavish a house one lives in, can we learn something from a man who got by
with just a loincloth?

 To all persons on the Service List in I.99-07-003 (Gas Structure
OII):

 As part of the approved Gas Structure settlements for PG&E and the
Comprehensive Settlement proposed for SoCalGas and SDG&E, SoCalGas and PG&E
would contract with Altra Energy Technologies (Altra) to develop several new
electronic trading services including anonymous imbalance trading, OFO
imbalance rights trading, storage trading and anonymous capacity trading.
Recently, while working on finalizing contracts to provide these services,
Altra informed both SoCalGas and PG&E that they are no longer interested in
offering these new services.  Altra restructured their business and has
determined that this service is not the right business direction for them at
this time.

 SoCalGas and PG&E were working together to provide a consistent
service prior to the announcement by Altra, and we will continue working
together to seek an alternative service provider for these services.  PG&E's
intention is to investigate the possible alternatives and to present those
alternatives to the parties to I.99-07-003 along with our suggested plan of
action as soon as possible.  PG&E understands that SoCal Gas intends to work
with parties in a similar fashion.  Since it is unknown how long it will
take a service provider other than Altra to develop these services, the
implementation dates for trading services by a third party will need to be
reevaluated once a selection is made and a development schedule set.

 We recognize that a replacement service provider raises a number of
questions such as implementation costs and service fees.  We will attempt to
address those questions as we investigate the alternatives.  Please send any

3048,"Frazier and Dari:  Elizabeth Brown and Rita Bianchi have asked whether we 
need to include our so-called ""pool"" contracts on TW's index of customers.  
These are FTS-1 agreements which have a reservation charge of $0 for transfer 
from a pool to a point within the pool (involving no actual movement of 
gas).  Historically TW has categorized such agreements as ""administrative"" 
and has not included them on the index of customers.  Apparently we need the 
contracts to exist as FTS-1 agreements for internal purposes.  

I suppose the question has come up again in Elizabeth's and Rita's review of 
our postings for Order 637 purposes:  whether the two ""pool"" contracts (Amoco 
and Burlington) need to be included on the Index of Customers.  I suppose 
that technically they should be since they are called FTS-1 agreements.  
However, I have very little heartburn with continuing to leave them off the 
list since no transportation is ever involved.

simplify the maintenance of our websites.  Please let me know what you think, ",Frazier Dari Elizabeth Brown Rita Bianchi Elizabeth Rita,0,"TW FTS-1 Amoco

2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow=

The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la=

possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our=

system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper=

Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I=

To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20

all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma=
ke=20
the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect.
=20
Application for declaratory order must include:

1.  Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate=20
treatment.  I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service.

2.  A statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets=20
necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect to=

the services at issue.  The Commission requires a narrow definition of the=
=20
market=01(""firm transportation"" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp=

we might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of=20

if they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if they=

disagree and/or deal with this issue outside the settlement process?  Are you 
saying that Edison can reserve capacity in the same manner as Core and 50% of 
noncore, but at the approx. 7.9 cent rate?

HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.... is this language saying that they can convert the 
VALUE of their capacity rights to a capacity contract at the point?  For 
example, if Edison has 200/d at 1 cent Wheeler access fee, they could conver 
it to approx. 25/d at the full 7.9 cent rate?

Also, there seems to be some confusion over whether we are going to post all

posting of Shipper call options only.  All other types of options will be 
generally available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, through our tariff.  My

being a crybaby.  It is tough being a baby, I think.  How did the doctor's 
app't go?  Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day.  
Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after 
maternity leave.  I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for 
everyone.  Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't 
wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!  Most everyone I know is 
raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.  Even the 
handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several 
days a week, for sanity's sake.

Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.  I get the impression that 
she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in 
for spontaneous visits, so that's good.  I always enjoy meeting her for 
lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into 
my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.  Thank God she 
can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.  

Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called ""Fucking A.""  It was 
a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.  I thought it would be funnier but it was 
actually pretty dark.  The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a 
strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.  Despite the subject 
matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.  Diverse 
Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown.  
(Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)  They mostly 
sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.  A lot of it is 
really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.  One of my friends 
at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been 
hanging out there to see whether I like the people.  

Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.

Further to the sell-down of Sutton Bridge it looks like the originators are 
planning, as part of that deal to assign infinity deal number 25556, a 
currency swap we have with Sutton Bridge to EDF/London Electricity.  The 
hedge for this deal is a back to back deal with Natwest, infinity deal number 
25555.

My questions are:
When this swap was originally entered into there would have been a credit 
reserve taken for it, which will have to be released.  How much is this and 
what is the process?  I am assuming this release of credit will not effect my 
traders P&L.  Can you please confirm this.

What else do we need to look at to complete this assignment?  What are the 
legal implications?


The originator is looking to do this fairly quickly and so a quick response 
would be greatly appreciated.

I propose the following steps to get through the final hurdle and be able to 
wrap up this Sisyphusian exercise.

I would like to have sample Equity Forward contracts amended for our 
registration language and any other items that you feel should be changed 
generated for ML, CSFB, BS (you can leave out the trade details). You can 
take their sample confirmations and change them.
I will then take the confirmations to Ryan Siurek and have him check the 
settlement language to make sure that they meet the new accounting guidelines.
We can incorporate Ryan's changes and then send the samples to the 
appropriate Investment Bank for their comments.
If everything checks out, we can then fill in the commercial terms for all 
the forwards completed to date.

I thinkthat this would simplify the whole process as we focus on 3 
confimation templates and not the many different trades with the various 
banks.

Call me to discuss any change to my plan.

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the ""Scan Risk"" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 2 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, March 21, 2002.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $4,000)	=	$4,000
One Short Tier 2 NG or NN (1 * $3,500)	=	- $3,500
Net Scan Risk ($4,000-$3,500)		=	$   500
Spread Rate	(1* $500)			+	$   500
Total Requirement				=	$1,000
Scan Risk Example Summary

help by doing some of the paralegal work to get several of the URGENT 
brokerage agreements done.  I do need your help on the following:

1. As I mentioned earlier today, the last few tasks I left for you for Enron 
Credit Inc. are critical.  I jsut need for you to call that contact to find 
out when they will have the tax I.D. number and let her know that we 
corrected the final slate of officers via Richard Sage and not by the info in 
the system and we want the info in the system updated right away.  We were 
able to get certain key documents to Bear in order to open the account but 
that stunt was contigent on our getting to them the outstanding information 
immediately thereafter and they are calling us on it.  Sara represented to me 
that this work was extremely urgent.  

Sara, maybe you can provide some guidance to Stephanie about whether she 
should put extra focus on these other tasks.

2.  As per my previous emails yesterday and today, please have the documents 
ready for Goldman International by the end of the day Thursday.

In the web description, David Forster is adamate that we use 'Fin Curr Swap'

we need to be poised to demonstrate that we offering the same Product both 
internally and externally. We understand that this could be viewed as a 
series of Forwards, but it is, in fact, a swap, as we are paying Fixed 
Amounts vs Floating Amounts in a like currency.

In the web description 'CAD/USD' has become 'CAD/$-m' to designate USD per 
month.

I have included a blurb on how we derive at the Notional Quantity per 
Determination Period.

I have removed the 'CAD' from 'CAD Fixed Amounts' and 'CAD Floating Amounts; 
because we state what the Contractual Currency is, it's redundant, and 
removing it allows us to open up to other currencies.

Section 2.2 of the Credit Agreement attached below provides that ENA will 
make any payment of interest to ABN AMRO Bank N.V. net of applicable U.S. 
federal withholding tax (i.e., ABN AMRO bears the burden of the tax).  While 
ENA can pay the generally required withholding tax equal to 30 percent of the 
gross payment, it should obtain the appropriate U.S. federal withholding 
certificate from ABN AMRO so that the withholding tax will be reduced to 
zero.  (I have assumed that ABN AMRO N.V. is a Dutch entity.  If that is not 
the case, can you let me know in which country it is formed?)

The appropriate form to obtain is either:

 1.  IRS Form W-8BEN (which provides that ABN AMRO is a non-U.S. entity with 
no U.S. nexus and is entitled to the benefits set forth in the treaty entered 
into by the country under which ABN AMRO is formed and the United States), or

 2.  IRS Form W-8ECI (which provides that ABN has a U.S. branch and that 
interest earned by ABN AMRO is attributable to its U.S. branch).

It is in ENA's best interests to obtain a form since, if no form is obtained 
an ENA does not withhold the appropriate amount of tax, then the IRS will 
look to ENA for payment.  Furthermore, I suspect that ABN AMRO would be 
unpleasantly surprised if it receives only 70 percent of the payment that it 
intended on receiving.

Please call me at ext. 35777 with any questions.

3195,"I have spoken with Wayne Stoltenberg at Bear Stearns (on the Investment 
Banking side) about the need to set up an account at Bear Stearns for JEDI I 
to execute the sale of the Quicksilver Shares.  I explained that the 
operations people are reluctant to establish an account if there is little 
activity anticipated.  In the case of this JEDI I account, the only 
transaction this will take place is the SALE of the Quicksilver shares, there 
will be no further activity.  In fact, we will probably be closing the 
account soon after the trade is settled.  He is very much aware of the 
situation and is going to contact the appropriate people in Chicago to 
instruct them to be fully cooperative with Enron in establishing this 
account.  

I realize this is a huge inconvenience to have to set up an account for this 
one trade, but given the negotiations with the company and Bear Stearns, it 
is the best thing to do.  If anybody has any questions, please let me know.  
As I understand the events, the following items are being prepared by us 
(Enron):

Sara/Stephanie - preparing documents to open the account
Mary - preparing stock power/resolutions to sell the stock and retrieving the 
shares from the vault
Jim - obtaining any legal opinions if necessary (I just don't remember)
Aneela/Theresa - working with the BS contact to send documents to
Mark/Jempy - working with Wayne(BS) to get the sale done

Hi there.  Joe Hunter gave me your name as his contact for having
previously worked on this deal with him.  He's on vacation this week,
and I'm working on the same deal for purposes of sending 
the counterparty notification of a change.

We did a financial commodity swap with Chase in April, 1999, and
both the Notional Quantity per Calc. Period and Floating Price were
done as attachments, with variable prices, quantities, and reference
locations.  Also, there is a provision with the confirm (drafted by Chase)
where Enron may request a change to any alternate ""Price Source for any
Floating Price for all or a portion of any Notional Quantity...""  

We have made two such requests, on April 22, 1999 and again on
May 27, 1999.  We were notified this month of a third request for change,
and although our paperwork here is unfortunately not perfect, I followed
the format for what we sent out twice previously.  Attached are my drafts.
Could you please take a look at them and make any changes you
deem necessary?  I have the original confirmation down here - and
if you need to see that too, I'll run it up to you.  

Thanks.

reorganization in late 2000.

Within Dave's Generation Investments group; Michael J. Miller will lead the 
effort to acquire new QF projects, Chuck Ward will lead the restructuring 
efforts on existing QF projects, and Carl Tricoli will lead the initiative to 
develop and market capital products to IPP's.  In addition, Mitch Robinson 
will lead a new initiative to evaluate opportunities with coal fired 
generation.  Dave and Kevin Presto will attempt to leverage the Generation 
Investments business and the Origination activities through a tighter 
integration between the two groups.

Dave has over nine years of direct experience in gas and power origination at 
Enron including an outstanding performance over the last couple of years 
building the Generation Investments business.  He also spent two years

duplicate for additional affiliates of ENA.  Also, we screen all agreements

3220,"I do not know anything about a Waiver of Conflicts for this specific 
Counterpart (from Lotus Notes- it appears that Sara worked on the file) but I 
have cleared conflicts when working with Kevin Leitao and others in the past. 
I used to run potential conflicts past Mark T. but this procedure seems to 
have changed, at least with respect to Houston based firms. 

Last week I had 2 instances where a Bracewell atty was asked to represent our 
CP in connection with negotiating a swap agreement. One Bracewell atty was 
from the NY office; the other from their Chicago office. After speaking to 
Mark T. who spoke to Mark H., the proper thing to do is to ask Jim Derrick to 
clear the conflict, especially when the law firm is Houston based. 

Jim D. cleared the conflict in both cases subject to the following 
conditions: 

1. The waiver should be narrowly drawn for this specific matter ONLY. 
2. The Atty/Firm will not act for CP in any proceedings adverse to Enron.
3. The Atty/Firm will not act in any litigation on behalf of CP against Enron.

With regard to a Waiver letter, Jim D. said that if the transaction/agreement 
concerns ENA - then Mark H. should sign it. If it concerns Enron Corp., Jim 
D., Rob Walls or Rex Rogers could sign it. 

Hope this is helpful,

    A part from an airplane that crashed in the Great Salt Lake on Sunday.
                       (Danny La/ The Salt Lake Tribune)

    BY NESREEN KHASHAN
    THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE

        GREAT SALT LAKE -- Tooele Valley Airport weekend manager Gary Parks
    heard the steady buzz of the KingAir Beech overhead.
        It was 5:20 p.m. on Sunday when he recognized the unmistakable
    sound of the twin-engine aircraft flying over the Great Salt Lake,
    minutes before it spiraled into the icy waters below, killing all nine
    people on board.
        When the plane went down, snow was driving down hard, and there was
    about a quarter-mile visibility around Tooele Valley, Parks said. While
    he wondered if the plane might land at a different airport, having
    unshakable confidence in John Cashman, the plane's veteran pilot, he
    didn't think the worst.
        ""No, I didn't have a bad feeling,"" Parks said. ""He was the best,
    most competent pilot I'd ever seen in my life.""
        Today, federal investigators, including an official from the
    National Transportation Safety Board, are expected to begin examining
    the conditions that led to the crash. A barge hauling a crane is
    scheduled to arrive around noon to recover the shattered remains of the
    plane, which rests in about 5 feet of water 11 miles west and one mile
    north of the Salt Lake Marina.
        Preliminary reports indicate that the plane was flying under visual
    flight regulations, or VFR, which require that minimum visibility and
    weather standards be met, said Federal Aviation Administration
    spokesman Michael Fergus from Seattle. But federal investigators said
    there are no indications yet whether adverse weather played a role in
    the crash. Investigators still don't know if the pilot used or switched
    to flight instruments to navigate, which are most commonly used to
    compensate for poor visibility.
        The plane carrying Cashman and eight skydivers was returning from a
    weekend of jumping in Mesquite, Nev. Two of the skydivers, husband and
    wife, were the owners of Skydive Salt Lake, a Tooele-based company.
    Keith Stewart, the company's only other full-time employee, said the
    plane was used to make up to 23 jumps in Nevada from Friday through
    Sunday.
        Parks said he attempted to make radio contact with the plane
    immediately after he heard its engines. Investigators said Cashman
    never signaled for help, and Parks' efforts to reach the pilot were
    fruitless, he said.
        About five minutes later, the husband of one of the plane's
    passengers arrived at the airport to pick up his wife. Parks said at
    around 3:15 p.m. the man's wife had called her husband to say she was
    boarding.
        The 35-year-old plane didn't have a registered flight plan with the
    FAA. That meant airport officials didn't know it was in the air when
    Parks began calling around to see if the plane had landed at an
    alternate location. So when airport officials began searching for the
    aircraft about two hours after it disappeared, they examined several
    hours of radar reports to determine the plane's location, said Tooele
    County sheriff's Deputy Lt. Frank Park.
        Search-and-rescue officials believe that the four women and five
    men died instantly as the plane hit the water, fragmenting into pieces.

        Flying in from the southwest, the plane was probably making a
    180-degree turn into the Tooele airport runway when it went down,
    airport officials say.
        The first body was found at 1:30 a.m. Monday by the shores of the
    marina. During the next several hours, all nine bodies were recovered.
    Seven of the bodies were also found on the shore.
        Through the rest of Monday morning, a crew of at least three dozen
    on three boats concentrated on recovering personal effects from the
    plane.
        Brian Hall, one of the rescue workers who scoured the waters with
    flashlights that pierced the darkness, said the hardest part was ""not
    knowing what you were going to find until you got there.""
        Recovery crews retrieved foam pads, helmets, parachutes and other
    skydiving equipment.
        Parks said he was struck more than once by the commonplace items --
    like a single shoe floating in the water -- that were meticulously
    plucked from the scene. Most backpacks, duffle bags and other luggage
    that were floating were still zipped shut, but Parks recalled one large
    blue suitcase that had burst open, scattering articles of clothing over
    the water.
        ""I've been doing this for a lot of years and it never gets easy,""
    Parks commented. ""Unfortunately, any time you're involved with any
    tragedy like this, there will always be reminders of its personal
    nature.""
        Monday's crash comes exactly five years after a small plane crash
    in Idaho in which six Utah businessmen and two pilots were killed.

3237,"Attached is our report on the impact of last week's events on the reinsurance industry.  We are continuing to monitor revised claims estimates and other implications for the industry and will update you on any developments as soon as possible.

Highlights include:
Initial Estimates
?	A trend toward initial estimates growing over time as more information becomes available typically occurs, especially in times of complex and costly disasters.
The complexity of the insured coverage (multiple types, heavily syndicated, heavily layered and heavily reinsured) makes developing estimates on even the most straightforward exposures (e.g., commercial property) a huge challenge.  Other sources of exposure (e.g., business interruption and 3rd party liability) are nearly impossible to estimate accurately at this time.  
Insurers generally track their losses on a net basis, based in the presumption that all ceded reinsurance is collectible.  There will likely be disagreements between insurers and reinsurers about the extent of coverage.  It is also possible that some reinsurers will be unable to honor all their claims, leaving primary insurers to shoulder a heavier load.
Industry Implications 
Beyond the immediate impact of this disaster on insurers' direct costs, industry analysts also note a broader number of implications for the industry:
Continued flight to size and quality of insurance carrier, causing further consolidation of the industry.
Acceleration of price increases already underway within commercial insurance and reinsurance.  
Acceleration of restructuring at Lloyd's, a market that specializes in just the types of coverages (aviation, specialty commercial, catastrophe reinsurance) that will be hardest hit.  Some analysts put Lloyd's share at $1.5 billion or more, a heavy blow given that many Lloyd's syndicates have suffered significant losses in recent years.

2 Direct Access bills (Bowen, Kelly) are still on the table.  Have not 
changed much since my earlier e-mail to you, except that Bowen bill now 
includes a fee to the alternate provider when a customer is ""involuntarily 
returned"" to the utility.  Language is attached.

 - SB 27xx - mockup.doc

Right now, this legislation is awaiting the outcome of negotiations involving 
SCE and other parties (Jeff Dasovich is our rep).  Speaker Hertzberg and 
Senator Burton both have endorsed these negotiations and promised to support 
agreements the parties reach.   Jeff tells me this morning they are getting 
close to agreement on core/non-core and direct access issues but there are 
still major stumbling blocks,  mostly surrounding the going forward DWR costs 
and contracts, and the issuance of bonds to pay for them.  The bond guys see 
direct access as possible undermining the bonds.  If or once agreement is 
reached, the expectation is that enabling legislation would be crafted that 
would apply California-wide.

The general structure in the SCE discussion is this -
By Jan 1, '03, 500 kW+ customers decide to go to market or stay with utility 
for a long (5 yrs+) period.  Re-entry from market would be with up to 12 
month notice and could require customer to pay spot market price under 
utility default.   20-500 kw customers would have voluntary direct access.  
Under 20 kw customers would have green-only voluntary direct access.   
Recovery for past undercollections is being negotiated, but will likely 
require large customers (20 kw+)  to pay a disproportionate share of the 
costs.

This may be less than definitive, but as usual, the situation is fluid.   
Marty and Jeremy, are you available for a Wednesday morning call with Jeff 
Dasovich? 

Also, just in case you didn't hear, the Commission is scheduled to vote on 
Thursday the 14th on an order that would suspend direct access under the 
AB1x.  The expectation is that the vote will be delayed.  Best information 
says there are not enough votes to approve direct access suspension.

3274,"Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to 
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond 
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt 
from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from 
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services 
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it 
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but 
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by 
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying 
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only 
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from 
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took 
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the 
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree 
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create 
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include 
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what 
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with 
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it 
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to 
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short 
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby 
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity 
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to 
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches 
to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct 
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that 
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if 
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and 
passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Best,

OUTLOOK
Senate Returns To More Recriminations Over Priorities
   The week-long Thanksgiving break appears to have had little
salutary effect on relations between the two parties in the
Senate, where Republicans and Democrats again locked horns today
on tax and FY02 spending bills. Majority Leader Daschle told
colleagues on the Senate floor he intends to drop the stalled
economic stimulus bill and turn to controversial legislation to
aid retired railroad workers and the farm bill. That provoked
charges and counter-charges from Republicans and Democrats that
the other party was stalling the stimulus bill. ""We shouldn't be
doing anything else until we get an agreement worked out on a
stimulus bill,"" said Minority Leader Lott.
   Daschle said Republicans were ""filibustering the stimulus bill
as we speak,"" leaving him no choice but to bring up other
measures. He invited Republicans to convene bipartisan
negotiations on the bill - but insisted those include discussions
on a $15 billion Democratic ""homeland security"" spending package.
He expressed a willingness to convene two separate negotiations,
but said the spending proposals had to be part of the talks. ""We
ought to be able to find some middle ground between zero and [$15
billion],"" he said, ""but the Republicans are refusing to even
meet."" Lott charged Democrats were pushing for new spending that
President Bush has not requested because they do not really want
to pass a stimulus bill. ""Your interest is to shovel the stimulus
bill off to the side,"" he said. Meanwhile, a proposal by Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., to provide a temporary payroll tax holiday
appears to be gaining currency among some Republicans.
   Daschle's plan to move to the bill to increase benefits to
survivors of retired railroad workers did not win him any points
with Republicans. ""There will be strenuous opposition to the
railroad retirement bill using procedural devices that are
available to all members,"" vowed Minority Whip Nickles during the
floor exchange. Nickles called the bill a ""$15 billion giveaway,""
and also warned that the farm bill, which has also drawn
objections from budget hawks, ""is not going to pass in a day or
two."" Daschle tried to head off GOP plans to attach energy
legislation to either the farm bill or the railroad retirement
bill by committing to bring up energy legislation after Congress
returns Jan. 22. But Lott criticized Daschle for planning to
bring a Democratic energy package straight to the floor rather
than going through committee, and for failing to commit to
completing an energy bill.
   As for the FY02 Defense appropriations bill, which Lott also
urged Daschle to put on the floor, Daschle said the Senate would
take it up after the House acts, and once the Senate
Appropriations Committee has a chance to mark it up. A Senate
Appropriations spokesman said action is likely early next week.
On Wednesday, the House plans to consider the $317.5 billion
spending measure, which also carries the $20 billion terrorism
supplemental. The House Rules Committee plans to meet on that
bill at 5 p.m. today, and Democrats will press their case to
offer amendments to increase the supplemental. Although GOP
leaders have indicated their opposition, New York GOP Rep. John
Sweeney plans to break with them and join Rep. Nita Lowey, D-
N.Y., to push for an amendment to add $9 billion in recovery aid
to the supplemental. - by Geoff Earle and Lisa Caruso

Armey Sees Two More Weeks Needed To Finish Up
   House Majority Leader Armey said this afternoon that Congress
needs at least two more weeks to complete the FY02 spending bills
and economic stimulus legislation, while suggesting that
lawmakers could go home without the latter. Armey said the
economic stimulus debate has gotten caught up in philosophical
differences, commenting, ""If you want to attach a dateline to the
[end of the] session, attach it to that."" Armey, who has placed
tax relief at the heart of a stimulus bill, said he does not want
a bill that does not stimulate business investment. ""If you can't
get a real economic stimulus package that makes sense . then
you're better off doing nothing,"" he said. Armey also suggested
that Congress would have to approve a sixth continuing resolution
when the current CR expires Dec. 6. ""I'm personally planning on
another,"" he said. ""We're looking at this trade bill on the 6th..
We're still trying to get through the impasse with the Senate on
stimulus.""
   Armey said he remains committed to the Dec. 6 date to consider
renewal of presidential trade negotiating authority, and said it
is forcing undecided members to make up their minds. ""The only
thing was announce a date and make everyone get off the dime,""
Armey said, predicting, ""The votes will be there."" This week
Armey said the House would consider the FY02 Defense
appropriations bill Wednesday and terrorism reinsurance
legislation Thursday or Friday, also mentioning conference
reports on the FY02 Foreign Operations and District of Columbia
spending bills as possibilities. Armey said jurisdictional
disputes on the reinsurance bill would likely be sorted out in
the Rules Committee, singling out liability language from the
Judiciary Committee. Looking beyond this week, Armey said he
might schedule election reform next week, and said he was he was
hopeful an education conference committee report would be ready
before the end of the session. - by Mark Wegner

ECONOMY
White House Shows No Sign Of Budging Over Spending
   The White House today showed no sign of budging on its desire
to hold the line on spending, despite continuing Democratic
demands for more money to combat terrorism and aid areas affected
by the Sept. 11 attacks. Referring to an earlier deal between
congressional appropriators and the White House to hold FY02
spending to $686 billion and keep the supplemental at $40
billion, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer today
declared, ""A deal is a deal is a deal."" Fleischer reiterated
President Bush's threat to veto legislation that breaches the
agreed-upon totals. And the White House will continue its
campaign to pressure the Senate to pass a stimulus package. Bush
will make the point during his weekly breakfast meeting Wednesday
with House Speaker Hastert, Senate Majority Leader Daschle,
Senate Minority Leader Lott and House Minority Leader Gephardt,
Fleischer said. And the president will urge movement on stimulus
legislation in a speech to be delivered later Wednesday.
   House Majority Leader Armey today continued to press the
Senate to act on stimulus legislation. ""There is in fact a
recession and that obviously gives us some sense of urgency,""
Armey said, chiding Daschle for scheduling Senate votes on
railroad retirement legislation and the farm bill instead of
continuing to work on a stimulus package. Armey said public
opinion over the Thanksgiving break could, in part, determine
whether the Senate acts on a stimulus plan. ""Have they
communicated to the Senate in the past 10 days that this is an
important thing in their lives?"" Armey asked.
   House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas also continued to blast
Daschle for failing to move a stimulus bill through the Senate,
dismissing as ""hogwash"" the suggestion that no tax bill could
garner 60 votes to overcome a budget point of order. Thomas also
charged that Daschle deliberately helped create a partisan
measure in the Senate Finance Committee. Thomas continued to
refuse to negotiate any bicameral agreement so long as the $15
billion package of domestic security spending items remains on
the table. Without those items, Thomas said the leaders of the
Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees could put
together a compromise ""over a weekend."" He declined to offer
specific views on the package put together by Senate moderates.
However, he acknowledged that a final bill could contain items
not approved by either House. Also, while he continued to
vigorously defend full repeal of the corporate alternative
minimum tax, he said he would look at other options ""assuming
there is a middle ground.""
   Meanwhile, the National Federation of Independent Business
Monday urged congressional leaders to pass a stimulus bill
including expanded Section 179 expensing provisions, acceleration
and permanent enactment of the tax cuts passed earlier this year,
allowing small business owners to depreciate vehicles ""within a
reasonable time frame,"" and expanding the availability of tax
refunds for net operating losses to five years from the current
two-year limit. In a letter, NFIB said these provisions ""would be
the most beneficial for small business,"" and urged Congress to
focus on ""real benefits for small businesses, while avoiding
placing costly mandates on employers that will slow economic
development."" - by Keith Koffler, Mark Wegner and Stephen Norton

Brownback Fails To Get Floor Debate On Human Cloning
   The debate over human cloning found its way to the Senate
floor today as Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., followed through on
his vow to try to bring up for debate a cloning-ban bill that
passed the House in July and has been endorsed by President Bush.
But Democratic leaders blocked the move by objecting to its
consideration. Brownback and allies who oppose human cloning
intended to produce a live birth, as well as the creation of
embryos intended to be destroyed for research, said Sunday's
announcement by a Massachusetts biotech firm that it has
successfully cloned a six-cell embryo means the Senate should act
immediately. ""I've been telling this body for months that this
issue was going to be here and now it's here,"" said Brownback.
""We now have the first human clone."" Majority Whip Reid objected
to immediate consideration, noting that Majority Leader Daschle
has promised a full debate in February or March on both the
House-passed bill and a proposal by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., on
the related issue of expanding federal funding for research on
human embryonic stem cells.
   Brownback then proposed a fallback position for a six-month
moratorium on human cloning research. ""People are very
uncomfortable with human cloning,"" he said, so much so that ""we
should hit the pause button at this point."" But Reid rejected
that proposal as well. While Reid acknowledged that Brownback
feels strongly about the issue, he said there are those who feel
just as strongly on the other side. ""They believe therapeutic
cloning is something that will lead very quickly to the
abolishment of diabetes, Parkinson's and other diseases,"" Reid
said. For those people, he added, a moratorium ""for six months,
for two months, or for two days"" represents an unacceptable
delay.
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., suggested Democrats could
quickly reach agreement on legislation that would ban the
implantation of a cloned embryo into a woman's uterus, a proposal
Brownback rejected. And Specter said he would be happy to see an
immediate debate and vote on the matter, although he prefers to
wait to have a chance for scientists interested in research on
cloning to make their case. Specter said at a news conference
that his willingness to proceed does not necessarily signal that
his side has the votes to defeat Brownback, but that ""I'm just
not disposed to duck the matter. I think there are too many
delays in the Senate."" - by Julie Rovner

FINANCE
Consumer Activists Opposing 'Rent To Own' Legislation
   Consumer activists are up in arms over plans by the House
Financial Services Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit
Subcommittee to resume marking up Wednesday a controversial ""rent
to own"" bill, action on which was postponed in September. In a
letter today, activists urged lawmakers to oppose the markup
vehicle, a proposal by Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., which they
claim will roll back strong protections against ""predatory"" rent-
to-own practices in a handful of states. ""The Jones bill .pre-
empts the strongest state laws - in Minnesota, New Jersey,
Wisconsin and Vermont - that treat rent-to-own as a credit
transaction"" as opposed to a lease, which does not afford
consumers the same level of protection from abuse, the activists
said. Industry supporters of the measure said they simply want
legal certainty that their transactions will be treated as
leases, and claim that certainty will work to consumers' benefit.
If all such transactions were treated as sales, ""we would be put
out of business,"" said one industry lobbyist, who noted that
rental purchase agreements often are the only way low-income
individuals can secure appliances and luxury items.
   The protest letter is signed by officials with the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group, the Consumer Federation of America,
Consumers Union and the National Consumer Law Center, among
others, who added: ""This wolf-in-sheep's clothing is not a 'pro-
consumer' bill, as its industry proponents allege .[It] is
cleverly designed for one purpose, and one purpose only: to
eliminate existing stronger state law protections against
industry abuses .[A]t a time when the American people want the
Congress to focus on legislation to rebuild the nation's economy
and security, we are frankly both surprised and disappointed that
attempts are being made to move this unnecessary, extremely
controversial, special interest legislation."" The House measure,
which has nearly equally bipartisan sponsorship, is expected to
pass easily in committee, and on the House floor, as well. Its
fate in the Senate is less certain, however. - by Pamela Barnett

JUDICIARY
High Court Decides To Pass On Affirmative Action Case
   The Supreme Court abandoned its plan to rule on a major
reverse discrimination case today, concluding the case involving
a white-owned contractor from Colorado was not a good vehicle for
deciding whether federal affirmative action rules amount to
reverse discrimination, the Associated Press reported. The
court's action came in a unanimous, unsigned ruling and is an
anticlimactic end to what had been billed as an important case.
Opponents of racial preferences had hoped the court would use the
11-year fight over government highway contracts to effectively
declare federal affirmative action programs unconstitutional. The
case, Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Mineta, had developed
procedural problems that several justices suggested last month
were too messy to fix. The court flirted with overturning
affirmative action programs in its 1995 decision involving the
same case.
   The court also ruled today that Indian tribes must pay federal
gambling taxes on pull-tab lottery cards and other forms of
betting. States are not required to pay federal excise taxes on
wagers, and two Oklahoma tribes argued that Congress also
intended to exempt them. ""The language of the statute is too
strong to bend as the tribes would wish,"" Justice Stephen Breyer
wrote for the court's majority. The case involves pull-tab
lottery cards, which are sold to finance reservation activities.
The Chickasaw and Choctaw nations argued that the federal Indian
Gaming Regulatory Act was unclear on whether lottery cards can be
taxed. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a dissent joined by
Justice David Souter, said the court should have relied on the
long-established precedent requiring governments to interpret
ambiguity in tax laws favorably to the tribes.

Cantwell To Introduce The 'Reclaim Your Identity Act Of 2001'
   Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., promised Monday to try to amend
federal law to help curb identity theft, the Seattle Times
reported. Cantwell said she was introducing the ""Reclaim Your
Identity Act of 2001"" as the holiday shopping season begins
""because as credit card usage peaks, consumers deserve the tools
they need to protect their identity."" Cantwell's proposal, which
is based on a Washington state law that went into effect in July,
would require businesses to give copies of records reflecting
fraudulent transactions to identity-theft victims, require
consumer credit reporting agencies to block information that
appears on a victim's credit report as a result of identity theft
and change the statute of limitations for identity-theft victims
to file a claim. Cantwell said the chances are not good that her
proposal would get a hearing this year, but she hopes it will
raise awareness now and lead to reform next year.

   Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., passed a sobriety test given to him
after his car struck a pedestrian last month near the Washington
Monument, according to laboratory results released today, the
Chicago Tribune reported. Crane was given a blood test by U.S.
Park Police after the Oct. 30 accident and it showed the lawmaker
had no trace of alcohol or drugs. ""He's not had a drink in almost
two years, so it'd be impossible for it to be any other way,""
said Crane's spokesman. Crane is a recovering alcoholic who
completed a month-long stay at a rehabilitation center in April
2000. Police had said the legislator was tested only as a matter
of routine and Crane had shown no outward signs of intoxication.
The 36-year-old Long Beach, Calif., woman who was struck by
Crane's car was hospitalized at a Washington hospital after
suffering a concussion and some abrasions and released two days
later. Police said the woman was talking on her cell phone when
she ran across a street against a red light and into the path of
Crane's car. Crane, 70, was not injured in the accident and no
ticket was issued, said a police spokesman.

Health Insurance Association Of America Names Young As President
   The Health Insurance Association of America has named Don
Young as president of the organization. Young has been running
the organization on an interim basis since former president
Charles (Chip) Kahn decamped to head the Federation of American
Hospitals. Kahn succeeded Thomas Scully, who left the federation
to join the Bush administration as head the Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services. Young, a physician, is well known and well
respected in Washington health policy circles. He served as
executive director of Medicare's Prospective Payment Assessment
Commission for that advisory group's entire existence, from 1983
until it was merged into the current Medicare Payment Advisory
Commission in 1997. After leaving ProPAC, Young served as a
senior vice president at the American Association of Health Plans
before joining HIAA in 1999 as its chief operating officer and
medical director.

ECONOMY
Consumer Confidence Falls For The Fifth Consecutive Month
   Consumer confidence unexpectedly fell for the fifth
consecutive month in November as Americans continued to worry
about layoffs and their buying power, according to the Conference
Board. The organization reported today that its Consumer
Confidence Index fell to 82.2 from a revised 85.3 in October.
Analysts had been expecting an increase to 86.5. ""Rising
unemployment and continuing layoff announcements are dampening
confidence,"" said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's
Consumer Research Center. ""A turnaround in confidence levels is
not likely before year's end, nor are retailers likely to enjoy a
blockbuster holiday season."" The announcement was expected to
douse hopes that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would reach the
10,000-point level today after finishing Monday just 18 points
shy of that mark at 9,982.75. At 2 p.m., the DJIA stood at
9,949.26, a decline of 33 points from Monday's close.

ATTACK UPDATE
   As U.N. talks on the future of Afghanistan began in Germany,
anti-Taliban forces said today they have retaken control of a
fort where prisoners loyal to Osama bin Laden had staged a three-
day revolt, the Associated Press reported. U.S. Special Forces
were in action helping Northern Alliance forces put down the
bloody uprising in a mud-walled fortress-prison outside the
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. The alliance said it had
suppressed the revolt, killing the last of hundreds of rebelling
bin Laden loyalists. A courtyard of the fortress held the bodies
of 60 fighters slain in the fierce battle.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Marines expanded their base of operations in
southern Afghanistan, sending out heavily armed patrols in
Humvees loaded with anti-tank weapons and heavy machine guns.
U.S. helicopters and KC-130 cargo planes landed on the hardpacked
sand of the base, where an American flag was planted at the
center of a compound of buildings. After negotiations with
Pashtun tribal leaders on the fate of Taliban-held Spinboldak, a
key town on the main road from Kandahar to the Pakistani border,
tribesmen looted blankets and food from humanitarian aid
warehouses and drove the Taliban from power, the Afghan Islamic
Press said. The Taliban have vowed to fight to the death in
Kandahar. A spokesman, Mullah Abdullah, told the Pakistan-based
news agency that the Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, was
still in town and in command of his troops.

I hope that all is well.  It was very nice to talk to you this morning.

The purpose of this note is to keep you abreast of progress in determining 
the GA  needs for India, and seek your opinion for the best reply for Wade.  
I look forward for your comments and advise.

Best regards

AI

Here are the salient features:
Meeting with Wade:
The meeting with Wade indicated that he is open to suggestions to what needs 
to be done on the regulatory front.  He indicated that if GA sees, and 
agrees, he would be happy to finance-on a semi full time basis--such support 
from Houston.  His major concern is to satisfy himself that: a) all what 
needs to be done on the GA front is being done, b) manage and maintain an 
effective team (i.e., those currently employed in Bombay and Delhi Offices) 
just in case of need.  He mentioned that  he is not going to be ""penny wise 
and pound foolish"" given the $850 million at stake.  I informed him that 
Houston shall advise on the best approach as soon as taking stock is 
complete, and generally speaking, shall also deliver on what is needed. 
GA Needs in India:
The regulatory/government affairs needs in India are in the following five 
areas: 
a)  Third party Sales (basically for phase II output), 
b)  Dealing with the Regulatory Commission, 
c)  Dealing with MSEB (the customer), 
e)  Government of India, and 
f)  EBS.  
The volume and intensity of work, however, shall differ with the following 
scenarios, namely:  a) Enron/DPC intends to exit through arbitration, b) 
Enron/DPC intends to renegotiate the contract, and c) Undetermined as of 
yet.  Here is an assessment of this work load under the two former scenarios:

        Arbitration  Renegotiation
Third party Sales (basically for phase II output),   low/medium  high
Dealing with the Regulatory Commission,    medium  high
Dealing with MSEB (the customer),    medium  high
Government of India, and      high   high
EBS.         medium  medium

It is surprising to mention that most colleagues here say that Enron/DPC 
seems to be taking the arbitration route, although that renegotiation (in the 
sense of renegotiate, stabilize, then take hit on equity and exit), is the 
best way.  It is more surprising, however, that no one can speak with any 
degree of certainty on where the ship is going.  In this context, a 
risk-averse person shall take the ""undetermined scenario"" as equal to 
""renegotiation"", while a risk-taker shall take the ""undetermined"""" as equal 
to arbitration.  

Personal:
It is clear that the current personal here shall need support from Houston in 
the ""renegotiation"" scenario on a semi full time basis.  Short of that,  a 
visit every 6 weeks may  be adequate as the current team here will be working 
under legal/commercial.  

Suggested Approach:
Continue understanding the details of the outstanding regulatory tasks for 
the coming 3 to 4 days.  If the above opinion is still the same, then the 
suggested communication to Wade (preferably from you) is ""if there is 
renegotiation, then GA shall send the required person/persons on a semi-full 
time basis, if arbitration, then GA shall be available on as needed basis"".  

Caveat:
It is not clear what does RMcDonald wants to see on the ground to tilt the 
suggested approach above one way or another.

 I spoke with Bill Hawkins (Premier's Office)  to day and made the following 
points: a) the messages from the Premier/Wilson are still ambiguous and 
unclear; b) we will need clarification on three questions: 1) Is May 2002 a 
deadline (as per Wilson) or a target (as per Harris)?; 2) Is the gov't still 
prepared to consider a Fall opening if the 4 conditions are met?; and 3) Is 
the return of  the first Pickering A unit a pre-condition to market opening? 
- if it is, then any question about a Fall opening is moot since the earliest 
that unit will come back is December 31, 2001 (and more likely 
later).                          I did not press Bill for answers today but 
indicated that we would need clarification on these issues as soon as 
possible to stay engaged in the way that he wants us to. I outlined the 
interpretation that we had been encouraged  by Ministry of Energy to put on 
the message.  Importantly, Bill did not ""shut down"" our preferred 
interpretation.                                     Bill made three points: 
a) the critical factor in the announcement was continuing concern about the 
circumstances in California and the difficulties that California presents for 
making the decision to press ahead this year;   b) on the political front, 
the key opposition to moving ahead will come from the NDP rather than the 
Liberals: he wants us to help keep the Liberals on the sidelines;  and c) the 
gov't  (Ministry of Energy) is going to work on fleshing out over the next 
several weeks how they will assess when the 4 conditions will be satisfied 
and he wanted our help in that 
process.                                             I told Bill that we 
wanted to stay engaged but that our immediate interest was getting 
appropriate clarification of the message.                        Following 
Bill's call, I heard from Joel Singer, VP at OPG, who indicated that Floyd 
Laughren had assured OPG yesterday that the OEB was still targeting a Fall 
opening in its retail readiness efforts.  Singer did indicate, however, that 
OPG's  own demand supply assessment was not  as positive as our own and that 
concerns about the demand/suppy balance was continuing to be a big hurdle to 
get over.                            The IMO is also sticking with its 
testing/commissioning timeline and is not altering it in light of the 
announcement on Monday.                          `                ","John Rick Bill Hawkins Harris Bill Joel Singer Floyd

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron impatient at power deregulation pace.
By Chris Baltimore

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Nearly 10 years after Congress passed the Energy Policy Act in 1992 to promote competition in the nation's $220 billion wholesale power market, Enron Corp is growing impatient. 
From the U.S. Supreme Court to Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Houston-based energy and commodities trading giant has spread its open-market gospel.
""Five years ago we clearly thought we would be much farther along than we are now,"" Rick Shapiro, Enron's managing director of government affairs, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. 
""Finishing the job of making wholesale markets work across the U.S. is our number one objective,"" Shapiro said. 
Enron has a large stake in the regulatory debate. With wide-ranging commodity positions from lumber to pulp to bandwidth, oil and natural gas, its strategy hinges on the ability to transfer those products from buyer to seller more cheaply and quickly than its competitors. 
For the power market, that means Enron needs easy access to electric transmission lines, the interstate highway system that allows it to wheel supplies between regions and capitalize on short-term price imbalances. 
UTILITIES BLOCK COMPETITION 
Enron's big problem? Traditional utilities own transmission lines and have shaped the rules to block new entrants and favor their own generation, Shapiro said. 
""Vertically integrated monopolies have been very effective in delaying wholesale competition across the board,"" he said. 
In its pleas to Supreme Court justices and regulators, Enron has tried to empower federal regulators to force utilities to open their wires to competition. 
The Supreme Court last week heard oral arguments in a case that could be a watershed for the U.S. power industry and decide whether FERC has the right to drive competition on state transmission networks. 
In a classic battle of state versus federal jurisdictional turf, Enron wants the court to give FERC more authority to compel states to open their transmission grids to competitors. 
Meanwhile, New York has brought a companion case that says FERC has gone too far and the court should give control of transmission wires back to the states. 
""This is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds,"" Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, said at the oral argument. 
New York wants the court to revoke FERC's authority to regulate retail sales, contending electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal legislation. 
""I think a victory for New York would be absolutely disastrous for consumers across the country,"" Shapiro said. 
""FERC has jurisdiction. All they need to do is exercise it,"" Shapiro said, echoing Enron lawyers' case to Supreme Court justices that existing laws give FERC the power to do Enron's will. 
Enron does not see a recent congressional push for energy legislation as key to its plans, Shapiro said. ""FERC is doing its job on the electricity front. I'm not sure that legislation is required on that front."" 
FERC SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS 
With new Chairman Pat Wood at the helm, FERC is moving in the right direction to drive competition, Shapiro said. ""It's early in his tenure,"" Shapiro said of Wood. ""Many of the signs are promising."" 
Wood has made so-called regional transmission organizations a high priority and set aggressive agency rules to drive utilities to join them. 
RTOs establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk electricity across the borders of their own local transmission systems. Enron sees RTOs as a positive step toward competition. 
In what he called a ""carrots and sticks"" approach, Wood signaled in late September that utilities must either join RTOs or face losing the right to sell power in wholesale markets. 
FERC will hold a week-long meeting on RTOs beginning Monday. 
Enron is skeptical that carrots are useful, and is a bigger fan of sticks, Shapiro said. 
Utilities have ""gotten quite fat over the last nine or 10 years,"" Shapiro said, and will shrug off FERC's incentives. ""I'm not sure there are a sufficient number of carrots in the world right now to incentivize these companies,"" Shapiro said.

Below is a draft that reflects the subjects discussed and where I think we ought to land, based on our meeting earlier this week.  I would like to file these soon, so please get back to me.

In the meeting there was a lot of discussion on the RFP process.  Of course the utilities wanted to be able to draft the RFP, choose the winning bidder, have their affiliates participate in the process and have very scanty PUCO oversight, all of which I fought vigourously.  I was asked however if Enron could provide info on what should and should not be in an RFP.  On the should part, I said we could probably provide some insights, but that the should not category would probably be a ""I know it when I see it"" call.  Having said that, any input on this question would be appreciated.

 ",Janine,,RFP PUCO Enron
3301,"SPAIN AND CALIFORNIA

Please, note that the regulator (CNE, advisory body) has recently declared 
that ""the California situation cannot happen in Spain, although it is likely 
that some isolated blackouts may happen in the East coast this summer"".


Physical crisis in Spain

To me, it is not necessary to have a total blackout to admit that load 
margins in the Spanish power market have been recently decreasing, and that 
more generation capacity is needed! In fact, REE (Red Electrica de Espana, 
the transmission company and TSO) is relatively worried about shortages of 
capacity if demand keeps growing as in the recent years (6-8 percent). In 
Spain, no major power plants have been built in the last 20 years. The 
avalanche of new generation projects that have been announced (including 
Enron's Arcos CCGT 1200MW) since 1998 (outset of liberalisation) could cope 
with the need of new generation if firm access to gas transportation, 
regasification and transportation infrastructures is guaranteed.

Authorisation procedures for the construction of new power plants is not that 
bad, and so it is connection to the electricity grid. However, access to gas 
pipelines still remains  as the big issue to ensure the gas arrives to these 
new gas fired power plants, but mostly, that some of the CCGTs projects (as 
Enron's) get financed (find attached the memo about the Enron's Arcos power 
plant). Pipelines are owned are managed by Enagas, which is 100 percent owned 
by Gas Natural, who controls more than 95% of gas supplies in Spain. 

MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Prompt and adequated development of the gas system to make sure new gas 
fired plants are built.
2. For these new CCGTs to get financed, it is necessary that firm and 
continuous access is ensured by Enagas.  


Financial crisis in Spain

The regulator has also said that given the ""vertically integrated structure 
of the Spanish power utilities, it is impossible that the California's 
financial crisis happen"". This is only partially true because the CTCs buffer 
(stranded costs payments) have mitigated the financial stress of the 
utilities when they have faced increasing fuel costs. In reality, what will 
prevent a financial crisis in Spain will be the Government, by increasing 
tariffs if things go nasty.

However, from the Enron perspective, the existence of CTCs is distorting the 
market, both for retailing activities and the development of power projects, 
since market prices are not driven by demand and supply fundamentals.


MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Applaud the speed of liberalisation of the power market and the attempts 
of the Spanish goverment to make the transitional period as short as 
possible. (By 2003, all customers will be eligible).
2. It is necessary to go deeper into the separation of regulated 
(distribution) and non-regulated activities (generation and supply), 
facilitating the introduction of more competitors on the generation market, 
and reducing the market share of incumbents.


ITALY AND CALIFORNIA

Similar messages regarding the development of the gas system in Italy as 
those in Spain are equally valid. In addition, please note.

MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Applaud the recent efforts by the goverment to make simpler and more 
expedite the authorisation processes for building new power plants.
2. It is imperative that the Italian TSO facilitates the localisation of new 
power plants by providing accurate and prompt information about the 
transmission system capacity and expansion plans. The TSO must be there to 
help new developers (actually, the Italian TSO is very aware of this and has 
publicly declared to wish to go in this direction).
3. The Italian Power Pool was due for Jan 2001, but its start has being 
delayed, and it is uncertain when it will happen. For new entrants, to have 
the Pool live and running is of special interest to a) increase the 
understanding of the supply and demand fundamentals in the Italian market and 
b) to increase liquidity. Also, make sure you mention that the Pool should 
help entry by providing as much as detailed information as possible to all 
participants, mostly on its inception phase.  


Please, find attached a short summary of the Arcos situation. The main issue 
here is that Enagas (gas transco monopoly) is trying to grant access to 
transportation and regasfication infrastructures CONDITIONAL to the 
construction of a number of new infrastructures, which are also subject to 
obtaining permits issued by the authorities. Instead, the regulator (CNE) has 
basically imposed Enagas an obligation to build and grant access to Enron on 
a firm and continuous basis, that is, no conditional. The regulator's 
decision is binding but not normative.

Please find attached the first cut of the suggested structure.  Honestly, this was a surprisingly difficult task. 

The first cut, page one, is close to what is currently on the ground making the regions reporting to the head of the ""Electricity & Gas"".  The regions shall be divided-temporarily-into ""wholesale"" and ""retail"" by ISO regions.  This is because the skill set between ""wholesale"", and ""retail"" are different, and some time is required for them to converge (perhaps, 6 to 9 months) into one group.   


 
However, this suggestion does not address two concerns, namely,:
1.	How to bring Federal Government Affairs to focus on Electricity & Gas needs (mainly FERC).
2.	How to address the regional needs of Global Markets and EBS.

The second suggestion, addresses the first point by dividing Federal Government Affairs into two sections.  One section-mainly political relationship management-remains as suggested in slide one, taking FERC Government Affairs and put it under ""Energy Business"".  This avoids ""dotting reporting lines"" phenomenon which-in my opinion- is less effective.  

 Of course, Energy Business can bring the suggested components into one block of skill pool very similar to a consultancy model.  In which case, the entire group, as in slide three, will be inside one box, possibly making the implementation easier among the whole group.  The components of the box (i.e., the skill set required), however, will be the same as in slide 2.  The consulting structure can also address the regional needs of Global Markets and EBS, which are not envisaged to be substantial.

I would like to discuss this further with you and take it from there. 
Kindly advise.

3305,"Hi Rick,

I don't know.   Steve never did call that afternoon to discuss the leadership 
issue.  (My comment to him will be that I would welcome him stepping into a 
leadership role on these issues, but that he needs to step up to the plate.  
This means being able to do Hill meetings on his own, being willing to step 
back and re-evaluate our strategies from time to time, and looking beyond 
Scott for policy and technical guidance).

I'm also planning to make some general comments to the group as a whole at 
our EBS GA meeting in Colorado next week.  I think I need to talk about 
individual versus group efforts.  The issues circling in my mind at the 
moment are:

People need to realize that individual success does not happen independently 
of the success of our group as a whole.
This means that every person in our group needs to be able and willing to 
work constructively will every other individual in our group.  No exceptions.
Decisions about who attends meetings, whether with the FCC, Congressional 
members and staff, or EBS executives will be determined according to  the 
nature and purpose of the meeting.  That means that sometimes I step aside 
for you or Linda or Steve Kean, and that sometimes one person in my group 
steps aside for another.  Individual success in not measured by the meetings 
that you attend.  It's measured by our effectiveness in achieving our agenda.
 Anything else you can suggest that will help make clear to people that they 
are focusing on the wrong issues and that this will have a serious negative 
impact on their performance reviews.

I really would like to get beyond this point as quickly as possible.  Please 
let me know if you ever think I'm wasting too much of your time with these 
petty issues.

How's London?  Wayne and Zal have had a series of travel complications, so 
I'm the only one in Argentina so far.  I had a very good day of meetings with 
our lawyer yesterday.  We've rescheduled meetings with the Argentine 
regulators for Wednesday afternoon, so that Wayne and Zal will be able to 
make them.  This means only one day in Sao Paolo and one day in Brasilia, but 
from all that  I've heard that's not a bad thing.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system is not going to change =
in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Opening Statements

Nancy Brockway:  focus on two topics:  1) flowgate vs. LMP; and 2) relation=
ship between congestion management (CM) and resource planning.  She support=
s LMP and standard market design in New England.  Flowgate rights are cumbe=
rsome, create unnecessary uplift costs - freezing power distribution factor=
s is bad and could result in some free rides.  She is a Hogan follower, and=
 Hogan says flowgates can be done but are too difficult.  With regard to th=
e relationship between CM and resource planning, transmission is a monopoly=
, and the CM principle is that entrepreneurs make a decision - decide where=
 to site generation or transmission and take a risk.  FERC should not overr=
ide that principle.  Proposals for transmission expansion can undercut cong=
estion management.

Reem Fahey:  RTO needs to be the grid operator and the market operator.  Ca=
nnot use different bid stacks for balancing and congestion.  CM should have=
 a bid-based structure with LMP.  Design of CM should allow flexibility for=
 market participants to be in the spot and forward markets.  Transmission r=
ights - must be financial and not physical and must allow for financial hed=
ging in real time.  FERC should work towards the creation of trading hubs a=
nd market participants should have rights from hub to hub and hub to load. =
 These rights should not interfere with real time dispatch of the system.

Carol Guthrie:  Her company has diverse interests in electricity market - o=
ver 4,000 service locations, over 150 suppliers, more than 15 sites where t=
hey have industrial generation serving own load (500 MW). =20

Shmuel Oren:  Advocates minimal ISOs, direct assignment of congestion costs=
 in real time, flowgate rights proposal because it requires less centralize=
d coordination and supports forward rights.  Does not support ""one size fit=
s all.""  Need to understand gaming, modes of market failure.  Problems in T=
exas - people scheduled to cause congestion and then were paid to relieve t=
he congestion.  Need to charge for true congestion when it is predictable.

Andy Ott:  There is consensus in the industry that locational pricing works=
.  It's an operational tool used to manage reliability of the gird during c=
onstraints.  PJM has been using nodal pricing since 1998.  Utilities have r=
un their system on this approach for years - economic dispatch to meet dema=
nd.  Cannot do balancing and CM separately -- does not work.  Transmission =
rights must be financial.  Spot market is physical.  Financial model is the=
 hedging.  You need this separation because it allows players to do bilater=
als or buy or sell from the spot market.  Also allows FTRs to be traded and=
 used to protect from congestion. =20

Michael Schnitzer:  There is a preferred method of CM - the LMP based CM sy=
stem with financial rights.  DAM and RT bid-based security constrained loca=
tional pricing markets.  Bilateral transactions are allowed.  Transmission =
rights must be financial, not physical.  Allows transmission users to hedge=
 congestion costs.  Why is CM so important?  Need to get the prices right t=
o give the right signals to the market.  Three goals:  1) get dispatch righ=
t - show bilateral contracts and load the right price signal so they can re=
spond accordingly; 2) price signals to generation for location purposes - c=
larifies responsibility and risk allocations; 3) market signals for when to=
 expand the grid - LMP gives economic price signal and property right in FT=
Rs.

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  The panelists=
 agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tr=
adable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on whether FTRs or=
 flowgates are actually more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable;=
 Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

 Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=

These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to t=

ed right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Fri! da! y's practi=
ce that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return=

back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury rep=
ort on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against D=
etroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger =

uld be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - =
Tori Updated 11/16/01Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but=
 he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for=
 finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will A=
llen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Rus=
sell Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against =
the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this seaso=
n, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post s=
olid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull! Updated 11/16/0=
1 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good =
player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that ha=

on Brooks , QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against Sa=

 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his la=

 possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes ha! d ! =

  Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held i=

NEW FEATURES
from The Wall Street Journal


Dear Subscriber:

I hope you've had a chance to try out the new Wall Street Journal
Online since we introduced it January 28. If you haven't done so, I
encourage you to visit http://online.wsj.com and see what your
fellow subscribers are talking about - from home-page
personalization to improved links in articles to more intuitive
navigation.

We've seen many of you taking advantage of the personalization
features to have home-page access to your regularly used news
categories and portfolio. Remember you can set up personalization
by using Setup Center or directly from different pages of the site,
using the ""Add to Personalized Home Page"" link on industry and topic
pages. If you aren't seeing your portfolio on your home page, use
the ""Layout"" option in the Setup Center and click ""Show"" on the
buttons for Portfolio, then click Save Settings.

We know that with such a major step forward in design and
functionality some people may have trouble finding their favorite
content or features at first. We hope long-time subscribers will
appreciate the new labels for sections, which many users - new and
old - have indicated they find faster and more intuitive than the
original navigation.

One feature that I hope you have found by now is the ""In Today's
Paper"" page available from a link right below the main left-hand
section navigation. At a glance, this page allows you to see the
articles that appear on the print Journal's section pages, including
Marketplace, Money & Investing and Weekend Journal on Fridays. We
also provide links on this page to the past several days, and we're
continuing to build up the archive of previous days. (You'll also
find Page One articles listed on your home page directly below the
What's News column.)

+ Opinion is where you'll find Wall Street Journal editorials,
commentaries and op-ed columns. It's on the main section navigation.
+ Quotes & Research encompasses all of the in-depth company
information you may have known as Briefing Books. Use the upper-right
Quotes & Research form to get started.
+ Archive Search, available on the Advanced Search page linked from
below the upper-right search form, provides access into the premium
20-year archive of Journal articles and more than 6,000 other sources
formerly known as Publications Library. It's provided in conjunction
with Factiva, a Dow Jones-Reuters company.

We made substantial changes to our systems to support the new Online

Dear Mr Jeffrey K Skilling:

With click-through rates plunging all over the World Wide Web, conventional 
wisdom says that Internet portals no longer have a legitimate place in 
consumer marketing plans.

An exclusive analysis by Booz-Allen & Hamilton, however, paints an entirely 
different picture.  True...the role of portals has changed, but the change 
has made them even more potent than before.  Instead of mere gateways, 
portals are centers of content and commerce that draw audiences in the same 
way that large-circulation magazines and successful TV networks do.

Major changes are taking place in terms of banner advertising, search engine 
use, per-click pricing, and the way business is done on the Internet.  But 
the truly amazing aspect of all this is that portals are still changing.  
First they were gateways, now they are destinations...what will the next 
phase be?  And what will it mean to you?

To find the answers to those questions, I suggest that you carefully read 
""The Great Portal Payoff"" by Horacio D. Rozanski and Gerry Bollman in the 
upcoming issue of strategy+business.

When you do, you will see why strategy+business is so eagerly awaited by the 
select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send 
complimentary issues.

While we are on the subject, I should mention that our records indicate you 
have been receiving s+b since Jun 16 00.  There is no reason why you cannot 
keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free...but it would be best if 
you make arrangements right now to extend your subscription.

Great to hear from you.  Things still fine in my vacinity.  Surkan and
family ok, though of course everyone is afraid, worried and sad.  The big
picture is not good.  Looks like the death toll alone will reach several
thousand, the injured over ten thousand.

Power and water back on in most of area in my area, and I believe that is
true throughout city.  Just looking at an amazing chart on TV that shows an
incredible series of some one or two dozen aftershocks, all over 4.O.  The
original one was, according to CNN, 7.8.  Some of the other scenes on the
tube are hard to believe.  I trust you'll get to see a selection of them
back there.

Thanks for the offer of help.  Don't think this disaster will be borne by
everyone, though, as it seems food, drink and everyting else available to
all but those who died.  Still, its hard not to imagine that something this
big in a place who's resources were already stretched won't result in some
serious widespread problems.  So I'll keep you in touch.

Have been composing a note to you in my head, which I will do by hand soon
and send to you with some pictures of your visit here.  Briefly, though, it
was great to see you and I am very happy that you've seen a bit about my
life here.  Enjoyed seeing Kristin and hope she had fun.  Look forward to
seeing her and the other kids soon and meeting Rebecca some day.

Say hey to all, take care and write again soon.

Blockbuster has had several meetings with Universal to obtain rights to 
content for the video on demand (VOD) offering.  Blockbuster has proposed an 
agreement to license product for both VHS/DVD rentals and the video on demand 
offering.

The negotiations have stalled because Universal has not been willing to sign 
any long-term agreements without Vivendi's support.

Blockbuster has refused to renew their agreement with Universal for VHS/DVD 
rentals until Universal agrees to grant digital VOD rights.  This will be 
detrimental to both parties.

We would like for Vivendi to communicate to Universal that they would support 
a VOD agreement between Universal and Blockbuster for digital content 
rights.  A conversation with Mr. Messier on this topic would be appreciated.

This week: How Insurers Will Win the Finance Wars

New York, August 27, 2001 - The insurance industry is bracing for a tough fight against financial-services companies that are rapidly  adding insurance to their product offerings. According to the  fourth-annual Booz-Allen & Hamilton eInsurance survey, the Web will be a key battleground.

In mid 2000, the Booz-Allen survey, which analyzed 206 financial-services sites, found that the top 10 insurance sites attracted 5 million unique visitors per month - versus 10 million for brokerage sites and 18 million for bank sites. As a result, banks and brokerages that sell insurance are getting their marketing messages in front of customers far more often than insurance competitors.

How can insurance companies increase their visibility on the Web to attract and retain more customers? Booz-Allen & Hamilton's  eInsurance survey says more non-insurance products, alliances with financial partners, and useful tools to increase traffic can go a long way in helping insurers get back in the game.

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

3358,"I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr & Ken Brooks (immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of ""vacation freezes"". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee. It states in that policy the following:
""An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible.""
""The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee's vacation request.""
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this matter.

Jeff,

After your call I thought I should give you some background on Datacentric 
Broadband (DCB). 

1. The company was founded by Leslie Anderson a woman entrepreneur in Conroe 
Texas.  Leslie continues to be the largest non institutional shareholder and 
is Chairman of the Board.  The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, whom you 
met recently at the YPO gathering. 

2. DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cities 
in Texas.  They have deployed in nine different locations and have a strategy 
to grow from a regional player to a national player.  The market they are in 
requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in a city is 
critical to success.

3. We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone 
Investors who also invested $2 million. Redstone should continue to 
participate with us in any future investments we make in DCB.

4. We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however he 
made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not interested 
in the investment.

5. DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for 
continued growth.  We along with AA have been talking to other potential 
investors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.

6. About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pacific 
Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to $75 
million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial investment 
of $15 million.  U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a similar 
amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wireless 
access provider to smaller cities. After this request I asked Ken Rice if EBS 
would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction with U P or 
on a stand alone basis.  My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a strategic 
fit to their business model and would be interested in a much closer 
relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout. ( Although EBS and  DCB 
are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has used DCB 
to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.)  Ken's 
response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB and he 
didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies.  

7. We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about 
investments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing 
funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's 
commitment.

8.  At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any 
additional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from 
ourselves since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this 
investment.  They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic 
potential of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving 
forward in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.  We are 
currently in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal 
structure by the end of May.

  We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way while 
making our investment decision.  I truly believe that DCB is in a space that 
could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we could work 
together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit with DCB.  We 
will continue to develop relationships with other strategic and financial 
partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investment in DCB.

 I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.  We 
will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we make 
in DCB.  Please call me if you have any additional questions.

    Good Friday Morning - Comments From The
Local Guys!

Economic data so far this quarter has been extremely ambiguous. On the one
hand, the employment figures released last Friday were soft, with net hiring
shrinking for the second consecutive month and the unemployment rate rising
to 4.5%. On the other hand, consumer sentiment has improved, and the April
retail sales figures were stronger than anticipated. As we have mentioned,
this mixed data has increased the odds the Federal Reserve will ease by only
25bp next Tuesday. At this stage, Lehman Brothers' economists still think
the odds favor a 50bp cut, given the underlying weakness in the economy,
particularly in high-tech and manufacturing, together with the abysmal
employment data.

The change in the perception on the strength of the economy can be seen in
the higher interest rates posted below.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.87%.
The 10-year yield is 5.47%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.98%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.62 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $4.27 p/mcf.

   AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS

Entertainment S. Linde, .212.526.4009
Upfront Preview: CBS and FOX Appear Well Positioned
*With the WGA negotiations all but settled, the Entertainment industry will
now turn its sights to the upfront selling cycle, which
commences May 14 with presentations from the major Networks lasting through
May 17.
*The current ad market has created fears of a weak upfront market. Ad buyers
must be careful not to look at the current economic
environment as a proxy for the future. Based on this premise, there may be
upside to our 5%-10% estimated decline in upfront sales
(based on 65%-70% inventory sales with low to mid single digit price
increases).
*In our opinion, VIAB and FOX are the best positioned for this year's
upfront given that improved ratings in the key 18-49
demographic combined with our expectation for modest CPM increases will
boost unit pricing.

*On May 21, Reebok will be hosting an investor day in Canton, Massachusetts.
We believe that this event should be highly
informative as investors will have the opportunity to view the crucial back
to school product line as well as hear several key
executive presentations.
*We expect to hear presentations from David Perdue, a Reebok veteran and
recently appointed president of the Reebok brand, Jay
Margolis, president of the specialty division (Rockport, Ralph Lauren
footwear and Greg Norman brands) and Terry Pillow,
President of the Rockport brand, among others.
*We will also be looking for additional information on the company's new NFL
licensing deal, which could generate $200 million and
be accretive by $0.05 in 2002 (included in our 2002 estimate).
*We believe that an inflection point in the stock could be the 3Q01, where
we are estimating $60 million of NFL revenues. This
incremental revenue should aid in 12% overall revenue growth for RBK.

*STOR's management stated that the pipeline of activity for new customers
continues to be robust and that its current customer base is
also growing.
*We believe that STOR is benefiting from the increasing complexity of
managing enterprise data storage environments.
*We believe STOR is funded to profitability.
*The company's maturing sales force should lead to continued productivity
gains. In addition, STOR is shifting its revenue mix to
higher margin services.
*We believe that the stock overhang stemming from the lock-up expiration is
largely behind us.
*Despite its recent run, the stock is still trading at a discount to its
peer group.

FY: 12/31 Price Target $38 $38
Rank 1 1
*Our lower EPS view is not based on weakening Operations, but is due to
adjustments to our share base & interest expense estimates.
So we do not expect much impact on the stock. Lowering already-weak EPS
expectations will likely prove to be beneficial for the
stock. Maintain Op outlook
*Reducing our '01 EPS view from $1.50 to $1.46, now flat vs. a yr-ago & the
low on the Street
*Our revision reflects adjustments to our share base & interest expense
estimates. With $1.2b in buyback targeted in '01 & $452m
done in 1Q, our previous forecast reflected more aggressive repo; mgmt is
adamant that '01 buyback would not pass $1.2b. Also,
higher debt levels will not likely be offset by weak currencies as much as
we thought
*Imp'rtantly our Op outlook albeit weak is unchanged
*Maintain 1-rating. We're now confident that our '01 EPS view will not be
lowered anymore. With the shares at a 4+ year valuation
low & the bar on expectations very low, the risk/reward is favorable

*Yesterday IBM hosted its annual meeting for security analysts in New York.
While there were no major surprises, CEO Lou Gerstner
did outline some trends for the future, and stressed the importance of
innovation and integration (i.e., Technology and Services) for
the company going forward.
*Gerstner emphasized the importance of services as a driving force in all IT
spending, including hardware and software. Gerstner also
cited the need for continued technological development as a way to avoid
price wars driven by commoditization of products.
*Gerstner stressed IBM's commitment to high single-digit revenue growth and
double-digit earnings growth in the future. Gerstner
indicated that the company would not simply grow revenue at any cost, but
was instead focused on EPS and cash flow driven by an
operational execution.
*We maintain our current estimates and reiterate our 1-Strong Buy rating on
IBM shares.
IT Consulting & Computer Services K. Keirstead, .212.526.0442
Gerstner's View of IT Services
*Yesterdays comments from the CEO Lou Gerstner and the head of IBM Global
Services Doug Elix represent positive long-term
statements about the IT services industry. IBM is positioning itself as a
services-lead company and claimed that the services business
is now the most important segment of the technology sector. The meeting
supports our positive view of EDS while the comments
about the consulting and systems integration market make us incrementally
more worried about Sapient and Computer Sciences.

*There is no doubt in our minds that ERTS is one of the premier publishers
in the industry. The co's solid performance in a difficult Q
makes it easy to believe that when hurdles are absent (i.e. an abundance of
game consoles) they can outperform. That said, we wish
the stock were not so pricey. Due to valuation, we reiterate our market
perform.
*1Q01 operating EPS of $(0.09) vs $0.08 were better than our $(0.15) est.
Most of the upside came from EA Core, where in line revs
were bolstered by lower op. exp. At EA.com, slightly higher revs were offset
by lower margins.
*We are raising our consol. FY02E to $0.89 from $0.84 and are initiating
quarterly EPS of $(0.13), $(0.05), $0.87 and $0.20. We are
also initiating a consol. FY03E EPS of $1.71.
*Adjusting for EA.com, ERTS currently trades at a forward P/E of 35.3x -
higher than hist averages. Though ERTS is on the cusp of
solid growth, this valuation indicates that it is currently in the stock.

Background:

As you well know, over the last 9 months EBS has made substantial efforts to

have been no transactions between EBS and AT&T other than a couple dozen of 
circuit purchases by us mostly local loop.  Previously, our primary senior

perspective which prevented him from seeing how we could facilitate the AT&T 
business from a wholesale relationship.  They seemed to only want to sell us 
services.

Adventis advises us that Ianna now reports to David Dorman and that Dorman 
should be able to better understand the value that EBS can bring to further 
his business objectives.  It is my understanding that it will only be Dorman 
at the meeting (he is supposedly not bringing Ianna).  I view this meeting as 
a worthwhile shot to see if it is worth pursuing AT&T at all for the balance 
of the year for a big transaction.  Dorman's positive receptability to us is 
the only reason I can see to spend significant resources on AT&T in the near 
future.


EBS - AT&T History

Jun 2000 EES sponsored Executive Briefing with focus on EES and EBS - 
attendants include Frank Ianna from AT&T.

Oct 2000 - Extensive EBS team meets with extensive AT&T team to set up eight 
tactical and strategic working teams to find opportunities for the   
companies to build a bilateral commercial relationship.  After three weeks, 
results were presented to executive committee of both teams. Nothing 
materializes.

Potential Opportunities

AT&T currently spends a significant amount each year (expected to be in the 
$100s of millions) on offnet services (wholesale expenses) .  EBS would like 
AT&T to allocate a potion of the purchases towards EBS.

Adventis states there are currently numerous major undertakings by AT&T which 
are transforming the telecommunications operations at AT&T.  Is there not 
something EBS could do to help advance these undertakings?

At a minimum we would like AT&T to interconnect to our pooling points.


Final Note

I do not think we should lead with trading.  We should lead with our ability 
to provide services to the wholesale sector of the industry. The typical 
reaction we get from incumbent players is that if they don't trade or if they 
think that trading puts downward pressure on prices, then they should not do 
business with Enron.  They need to understand that they don't need to trade 
to have a valuable business relationship with  Enron

3376,"It was determined by a vote of the Forum Moderators at
our meeting May 8th to form a new Forum (Forum VIII).
This decision was based on the current Forum
membership (81); the number of new members wishing to
participate; and the number of prospective members
currently in process.

The new Forum affords a unique opportunity for
existing members.  In an effort to blend the
experience of new members with seasoned Forum members,
we are looking for the following:
     a) A member who wishes to change Forums
     b) Current Forum member having 3 years or less
     eligibility remaining in YPO who would like to
     help mentor an additional Forum.

We are considering that this may give a member the
opportunity to interact with other Houston YPOers or
perhaps re-invigorate an individual's Forum
experience.

If you have any interest, please contact me by May
22nd.  Please know that all questions, thoughts, or
expressions of interest will be held by me in strict
confidence.

By way of process, the new Forum will participate in
the draw with the other Forums who have indicated they
need members.  They will select first in the order.

We trust that this process will give the new Forum an
immediate opportunity to be successful.

Thank you for your cooperation.

3377,"Hello Jeff, the purpose for this message is to bring attention to
my firm, SDL International.   Big admirer of what Enron and you
 have done in the broadband sector and would like to prove the
value of my firm to Enron.   SDL is by far, one of the largest, market
leaders in the Globalization industry for Fortune 500 companies
who must have a global presence via the web to their targeted
customers.   SDL is based in the UK, (US HQ in Plano, TX), with
offices in over 26 countries and employing over 730.   We are
publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange, been in business
for  10 years and the only vendor in this space that is profitable.

I'd like to speak with you or a direct report about the potential of
working with Enron for your globalization needs.    Certainly
you  understand the extreme difficulties and expense you may face in
maintaining consistent content and branding across your multiple,
multi-lingual websites.  SDL is a leading globalization infrastructure and
services firm that can streamline those issues while positively impacting
the bottom line.  Our services span from Internationalization (both web
and software), technology (Webflow and ETS), professional services and
worldwide translation services, all developed and orchestrated to work
as a single, seamless effort.    Surely Enron handles alot of this already
but could the current process be made more cost effective as well
as expediting or increasing international revenue from foreign
markets?

SDL also offers ETS, a real time translation product that allows for
instant, multi lingual messaging, email, web based customer support,
etc... Product currently has a significant installed base of clients, in
particular, a joint effort between EDS and the FAA for global emails to
pilots and airports, as well as being used at Lucent as an internal
communications tool.    Again, this type of technology would be use
solely for content/info. one would not normally localize or translate.
ETS Webflow, which will further seperate us from the other static in the
Globalization industry.

I look forward to any suggestions you may have on how and with whom to
proceed further with. Thanks again for your time and have a great day.

Regards,

Michael

Per your recent request to Dr. Kitatani, we have contacted Mr. Idei's Office 
to
find out his travel plans to the US in June.  Unfortunately, we were informed
that he is currently not scheduled to be out in the West Coast in June, and
therefore, will not be able to meet with Mr. Skilling at this time.

However, we were also informed by Mr. Idei's Office that he would be more than
happy to meet with Mr. Skilling during his next visit to Tokyo.  Therefore,
please keep us posted on any future travel plans to Tokyo that Mr. Skilling 
may
have so that we may assist you accordingly.

     Thanks again for taking the time to meet with Alfredo and I yesterday.
We felt the meeting was very useful and informative.  Talk with you soon.

Mark",Jeff,,Alfredo
3383,"Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  
For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley 
about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily 
for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, 
while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it 
is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I 
will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term 
Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital 
community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future 
payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some 
very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to 
cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think 
that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if 
I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer 
enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned 
professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this 
note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too 
presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not 
wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep 
up the great work!

like to do this year.  I have zero vacation since Matt & I are going to
Alaska in August for 2 weeks.  It's not Jazz Fest, but I wanted to let you
know that we have 2 good events coming up in B'Ham next month.

1.  May 12 - Crawfish Boil.  Annual event to raise money for charity.  Entry
fee: asked $5 donation.  Bands, good food, beer.  Options to spread a
blanket or bring a chair or just wander around and stand in front of stages
(2 to choose from).  See link below for more info.
http://www.crawfishboil.org/ <http://www.crawfishboil.org/>

2.  May 18-20 - City Stages.  This is our annual music festival.  Other
cities (Atlanta, Chattanooga, etc.) have patterned their events from this
one that's been going on for over 20 years.  I've been once and it was fun -
multiple stages - not Jazz Fest caliber, but what is?  Tickets are $20/day
or $35-40/weekend pass.  Again, food, beers, etc.  See link below for more
info.
http://www.citystages.org/ <http://www.citystages.org/>

Just wanted to put the offer out there to see if you guys were interested.
Obviously, we'd work it out so that whoever came could stay at my house (I
figure I can sleep ~10).  Let me know if you're interested or if you've
found anything else we might want to look into.

1. In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30 day

effective?

2. In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the ""cap"" amount.

3. In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just like 
what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.

I have reviewed the ISDA Master that we have with Range Resources and here is 
a summary of the steps that need to be taken assuming that we have already 
notified them that they needed to post collateral: 

1. An Event of Default occurs upon their failure to post collateral within 2 
Business Days after notice of such failure is given to them by us.  

2. Once an Event of Default occurs, then we can elect an early Termination 
Date.  The ""Loss: method applies here.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, we 
need to coordinate closely with whoever will be doing the Loss calculation 
(and it should not be Fred or someone in his group) to make sure that they 
have the appropriate back up.  We would send a notice declaring an Early

provide them with our calculation of the Termination Amount.

As you can see, Leslie and I have been working extensively with Stephanie Miller for the last few weeks as she is trying to find a way to get rid of our 200,000 MMBtu/day of Block 2 capacity on El Paso.  In fact, I provided Stephanie an analysis of the regulatory history as far back as last March, even before we signed up for the capacity.  You will probably be getting some questions about it from Barry or maybe even Lavarato before too long since getting rid of this asset is very high on their priority list.

3453,"I have received 2 calls in the last two days from EES and ENA (Lance Hinricks and David Porter) wanting to know the details of AZ electric marketing.  They are apparently revisiting things there.  So here is my reaction to the APS filing, which I had not heard about.

It is my recollection that the spin off is part of the entire-ball-of-wax settlement approved by the ACC for the APS restructuring in 10/99.  Therefore they must have filed to reopen this settlement (which was not to be allowed, of course).  The settlement, while ""opening"" markets, effectively keeps them closed for lack of headroom until 7/04 at the earliest.  So, if there is a commercial interest in AZ, then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition (and it didn't - time has proved us 100% correct on that) and if APS wants to change the settlement, then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well.

That said, we do not get a great reception in AZ, and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success.  The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter (at least not yet).  We would have no one on our side.  

SO, it is an opening, but I would let the commercial folks tell us how much it is worth to them, given the less than great odds.

3457,"Attached is a new version including Jim and Amr's comments.

Regarding Jim's questions, the open possibility of the utility acting as Provider of last resort (POLR) means, in fact, that the utility may still be in the merchant function, but only as a back up provider (when the alternative supplier fails to provide the service or departs the area), with a very limited scope. Note that I am talking about the POLR and not of Default Provider (the supplier of those customers who choose not to choose) as defined in the paper ""The role of the Default Provider in Restructuring Energy Markets"". 

This means I would allow the utility to be POLR (which means a very limited merchant function) but not be Default Provider (which means a larger merchant role). Anyway, I think perhaps would be more realistic to allow the utility to keep a larger merchant function for residential customers, specially when few suppliers are willing to enter that market. I was told that in Georgia (the ideal ""theorical"" model) there are only 4 marketers still competing.

If you want to follow this approach, the message should be: The incumbent utility should be outside the merchant function except, for residential customers and, possibly, as a Provider of Last Resort of the remaining customers.

As it is written, I did not include the residential as exemption.
I think ""pricing the utility out of the merchant function"" (I guess you mean force it to charge high prices or to afford high costs without pass through) is not as good alternative as getting the utility out of the merchant function, since the last is easier to justify and makes more certain that all customers must choose an alternative supplier. As suggested by Jim I am including again the wording related to Order 636 that explains the reasons to limit the merchant function. I also included some wording related to pricing for the POLR.

I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC ""overpayment"".

On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the ""overpayment"" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.

3497,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

3506,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.",QNEC,,Enron Board of Directors Enron Corp. Savings Plan Plan QNEC Company Matching http://resources.hewitt.com/enron benefits.enron.com

	Attached is a spreadsheet detailing the amount the ISO short-paid the market for months December - March.  I reviewed these numbers with Keoni to confirm them.  According to Keoni, the amount paid to market participants will improve, as is evidenced in the month of March, but it will be ""a long time,"" before the ISO will be making payments in full to parties in a net-receivable position.  The ISO's ability to pay market participants relies heavily on the status of the two large utilities in California, one of which is not expected to come out of bankruptcy court for several years, among many other factors.  Also please note, when the ISO receives payment for prior months, it prorata allocates this amount across the market in the current month.  Example:  The ISO collected $2.7 million in March for the month of February, and included that in its March disbursement.

I spent several hours with TJ shadowing and we tested the 402 code while I examined results.  As each error or incorrect result was noted, we went to the code and walked through and made changes.  TJ is now running actual dates and we will check them in the morning.  When all is well, we will run the rest of October.  Next we will perform the same testing and coding revisions for 405 (only need to test for EPMI-side exceptions) and then we will be able to run 405 for the month.

After the latest unsuccessful run of 403, I delved into the specific details of the variances, and all of the material volumes are included in the Finals, so any allocations that would be created as a result of those variances would be reversed when I run the Final actualization.  So, this morning I manually calculated appropriate allocations for our Load customers (the variances are due to re-submitted meter data), entered the values in the ProRata allocation table, created an additional allocation for the remaining 1.9496MW variance, matched all up to the ISO, and completed 403 for Preliminaries.

I have actualized the regular stuff and set to M through October 27.  I will wrap those up on Friday.

At this point in time we are on target for completion of Prelims by Friday afternoon, but Finals may not be done until Monday.

	I want to give you an update about where we are with January actualizations, and going forward.  Currently, charge type 523, a grid management charge, is proving very difficult to allocate given the limited information the CAISO is currently giving us.  If you want specific detail regarding this feel free to talk to myself or Caroline.  Our deadline has currently been the second week of this month to have through March completed.  Given where we are today, which is half-way through January, this deadline is probably unrealistic.  Further progress depends entirely on being able to reconfigure our tools to allocate this charge type.  It is unknown at this point how long that will take.  I plan to keep you up to date where we are so there are no surprises.  We will have a better idea in a few days when we will be finished.

	I attended the Market Issues Forum at the California ISO yesterday and wanted to inform you of an important upcoming change in Grid Management (GMC) rates.  Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly.  They cited the following reasons for this:  1.  An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff.  2.  The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects.  They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance.  3.  A decrease in overall market volumes.  GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections.  
	The CAISO points out their costs will remain flat from 2001 to 2002.  They anticipate volume levels next year similar to what current volumes are, thus reducing the amount of megawatts they can effectively spread out their GMC charges over.  
	I have the following observations:  1.  Despite the decrease in volumes, and the decrease in overall market activity, the CAISO has no plans to reduce its current workforce of 500+ employees.  2.  When posed the question: Is CERS charged GMC for out of market energy?  Their answer was circumspect at best.   3.  The CAISO currently does not assess GMC charges to ancillary service volumes, they indicated however that they are strongly considering changing this policy to increase the denominator that they can spread out GMC.  
	The CAISO would also like to point out that these increases are worse case scenarios, and may not be this high.  But as we are all aware, in the California energy market, the worst-case scenario ends up looking optimistic in comparison to what actually ends up happening.  Below is a detailing of the changes.

	I spoke with Les Rawson today, and he met with El Paso last week.  He said they are ""really nervous,"" about how much money they owe us for underbilling of PX losses.

	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

TJ had to weave through the code for 402 all the way, as well as add 3 new function points: EPMI exceptions, ISO exceptions, and repeating (scavenging, he calls it) the exception roll up function from another module.  He has a test environment set up and is testing EPMI variance allocations, EPMI exceptions and ISO exceptions.  He has not yet done the 'scavenging' part.  He will be finished with 402 tonight, and tomorrow I will test the results on one of the days where I had samples of these exceptions.

The part of 405 that needs to be changed is for EPMI exception handling, which should be a much less involved endeavor.  

For 403, I attempted to follow all of the queries through to see if I could run some tests within the environment and determine what was being pulled as a variance, and how that variance was being allocated.  However, these queries are currently beyond my expertise (I plan to rectify that).  We are going to enlist Anna's help as much as possible for 403, and get to the bottom of what is happening.  As a side note, for the time change date, we have an extra HE 2, and the ISO has HE 25.  We are also going to get with Anna on how to resolve that.

3563,"Details of Changes:

The changes to SettleSupp were in the rate formula.  The original formula said, :""=IF(AK4>0,Curves!i49,Curves!I42), which means that if the volume in AK4 is greater than zero, use the Inc (I49 reference) price, otherwise use the Dec (I42 reference).  The problem was that the references were backwards, so I switched them to be . . .Curves!I42,Curves!I49.  That made the correct price come in.

This affected the 405 part of SettleSupp only, no other charges were modified.

For 403, the rate formula was ""=IF(AK20<0,CURVES!I81,CURVES!i88"" which means that if the deviation volume was less than zero, use the Inc, otherwise use the Dec.  I changed it so that it reads . . .(AK20>0,CURVES!i81. . .) so that it would use the Inc if the dev volume is greater than zero.  I confirmed that the dev volume calcs were correct first.

In all of my test runs, both of these changes pulled in the correct Inc or Dec rate, and applied it to the correct dev volume.

3579,"The last I heard, the MISO is supposed to begin offering service on their OASIS tomorrow for service starting January 1.  I wanted to let all of you know a bit about where we stand with regards to that process.

I have been working with several different folks here and at the MISO to ensure that we are ready to do business with the MISO and request service.  The MISO OASIS seems to be accepting our Tradewave Certs, so we just need to get our MISO login for their systems. Today, the MISO will be sending out logins to their systems via FedEx, and should arrive prior to 10am.  Christi Nicolay will be receiving this information and distributing it as soon as it arrives. 

Unfortunately, the MISO has been (as you probably know) cutting things closer and closer to the edge.  This login was supposed to be delivered a couple weeks ago, but they have just gotten around to sending it out.  Hopefully, we will not have any problems with it once it arrives.  As I understand it, there should be only one login set up for ""EPMI 24-Hour Operations,"" with a login of ""Enron.""  The password is currently only known by the MISO, but should be contained in the letter we receive tomorrow.

This login is a temporary one until we complete our final registration.  This final registration has been a bit more of a pain, as it has involved contractual agreements and credit obligations.  I am still working with our Legal, Credit, and AP folks to get everything set up.  Again, the MISO sent the final documents out fairly recently, and we have not had a great amount of time to review, analyze, and negotiate their terms.  Hopefully, we will have come to agreement with MISO about those items, and be able to file that final application soon.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at my desk (X53771) or via my cellular (713-927-4680).  Obviously, you can also call Christi (X37007) or Susan Lindberg (X30596) as well.

On the Auction Block

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. continued to fall Monday
against a backdrop of continued bearish fundamentals.  While mild weather
for most of the WSCC provided much of the impetus for the daily decline,
lower spot gas prices and abundant Northwest hydro generation were also
lending a helping hand.  ""I don't know if prices can dip much below current
levels, but if the fundamentals hold their current course hydro could be on
the margin, and we could see some single digit prices,"" said one marketer.
Temperatures were forecast to remain at above-normal levels through the
week, with Weather Derivatives calling for heating demand in the WSCC to
average only 69 percent of normal through January 14, though some cooling
was expected next week.  ""Forecasts are calling for cooler weather in the
Northwest and California next week, but temperatures are not expected to
fall low enough to warrant any large increases in demand,"" said one
Oregon-based trader, who added, ""And even if temperatures do fall
considerably, abundant hydro and cheap gas will likely keep any gains to a
minimum.""  On the political front, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said
Sunday that his department was reviewing whether or not revisions in U.S.
regulations were necessary to protect investors after the collapse of
one-time energy giant Enron Corp.  ""I think the dust hasn't cleared yet on
this case and it is not clear whether the company fulfilled all of its
obligations under the existing rules,"" said O'Neill of the provisions that
allowed top Enron executives to sell shares while employees holding Enron
stock in retirement plans could not.  ""If they did [comply with U.S.
regulations], it suggests that we need rule change.  If, on the contrary, it
turns out that they didn't fully comply with all the rules, we have a
different issue on our hands,"" O'Neill said on NBC.  An auction of Enron's
trading arm was reportedly taking place Monday, though no details had been
released as of this writing.  ""We hear that there are more than the two
original suitors that will be bidding on Enron, which is good news for Enron
traders, but only the winning bid is supposed to be announced, so it may be
a while before we know all the entities that expressed interest in obtaining
the company,"" said one source.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as 2$/MWh on Monday
as mild weather cut into demand and abundant hydropower kept supplies
healthy.  Light load goods fell by an average of 1.75$/MWh.  ""It was a quiet
day, with little load to speak of and oodles of available generation,"" said
one Northwest utility trader.  There were some rumors that the 484 MW
gas-fired Klamath unit in Oregon came down Monday morning, but confirmation
was not available.  ""It wouldn't make a bit of difference anyway,"" said one
trader of the possible outage.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were
slightly lower than on Friday, despite recent rains, but remained healthy at
85 kcfs through Friday, 70 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, and 85 kcfs next
Monday.  Weather forecasts called for above-normal temperatures in Portland
and Seattle over the course of the week, while the latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was calling for below-normal temperatures across the entire region
from January 13 through 17.  ""The six-to-ten offered some longs a glimmer of
hope today, but it's too far off to rely upon, and the current over
abundance of hydro power would likely offset all but the most prolonged cold
snap,"" hypothesized one market pundit.

With little change in the warm temperatures projected through Friday and
plenty of supply flooding the electricity market, power prices settled lower
across the Golden State in quiet Monday trade.  Players speculated on where
prices in the current bearish spot market would bottom out.  However, with
no cold weather on the horizon, most players were pessimistic of a quick
turn-around.  ""Prices could conceivably fall to the cost of hydro.  They
probably won't, but they could,"" commented one California trader.  On-peak
goods at NP15 and SP15 traded mostly flat to each other, between 20.5 and
22.5$/MWh, while cheaper power at COB attracted a few buyers, with deals
heard between 19 and 19.75$/MWh.  Light load transactions were heard mostly
in the 15 to 17$/MWh range.  In generation news, Moss Landing #6 (739 MW)
was operating at 500 MW on Monday.  The Duke unit was derated for planned
maintenance.   Fellow gas-fired generator Haynes #6 (341 MW) was all the way
off-line for planned maintenance, with no official cause or ETR.  However,
the rumor mill indicated the unit could be down possibly until the summer.
Weather doldrums were projected to continue at least through Friday, with
high temperatures expected in the mild mid-50s to upper-60s. The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures along the coast and
in Northern California, with normal temperatures in the southern interior,
from January 13 to 17.

Unseasonably mild weather, lower spot gas prices and returning generation
were all cited as factors that led to a softer electricity market in the
Southwest on Monday.  Peak power in the desert region fell by as much as
3.5$/MWh, while light load goods shed as much as 4.25$/MWh.  On the unit
front, Four Corners #4 and #5 (750 MW each), San Juan #1 (350 MW), and
Mohave #2 (790 MW) were all back in service Monday morning following
unplanned outages that began last week.  A six-to-ten-day forecast calling
for normal temperatures in Arizona and above-normal temperatures in New
Mexico from January 13 through 17 offered little hope for those looking for
a significant upswing in the market.

3590,"To all:

Over the past few months, Energy Operations has formally established global 
standards.   Exception reporting will officially begin for the West Desk on 
Monday, November 20th.  The exception reporting around these standards will:
help us gauge our performance and highlight areas for improvement
better allocate resources to issue areas
ensure individual and global business controllers are up to date as to 
arising issues

To accomplish this, numerous requirements have been established.  The  
requirement that affects trading is as follows:

Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)
Transactions are recorded with 100% accuracy and valued appropriately in an 
approved risk system for the applicable product
Transactions are input into Enpower or TAGG on date of trade (prior to calc)

HOW THIS AFFECTS WEST TRADERS:

The Risk group in Portland and Confirmations group in Houston will now begin 
reporting any exceptions to the above requirement on a daily basis.   Any 
deals entered late, incorrectly or changed after the calc will require full 
written explanation to the Global Risk Controls group (this includes trader 
name).  The materiality of the deal is not relevant, you can be written up 
for 1 MW deals or 200 MW deals.  The Global Risk Controls group is looking 
for flaws in the process, whether it be people-related or system related.  

This exception reporting begins on Monday.  Please come to the Risk group 
with any questions you may have, we would like the West Desk to appear on the 
exception report as infrequently as possible.  If you have any special deal 
types that you believe will be in violation of the above requirement, please 
notify Risk so we can communicate this to Global Risk Controls.

Thanks for your help in this matter,

-she never would tell us when something was changed so we would always have 
to run extra reports to make sure that we caught everything that might have 
gone into pending.  It wasn't a huge deal, but it certainly helps if you 
wanna drop an email or give us a call to let us know when anything changes 
-that's how we do it here; everyone knows to tell documentation when they 
revise any deals.  Also, don't forget to put notes in anytime you change 
anything in Deal Entry to CYA.  So glad to have you and I can't wait to meet 
you!
Not sure how good a tan you're gonna get around the New Year, though.  I 
could let you know about some good tanning salons while you're in town (j/k).
Thanks again!

3659,"Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes 
the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that 
you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping 
bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, 
but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well 
here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of 
people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you 
left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, 
some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of 
this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status 
of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the 
computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner 
that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, ""What does 
it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a 
disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?"" 
They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most 
things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of 
authority, as in, ""No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly 
be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market 
right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at 
a time like this?"" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is 
why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the 
great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office 
will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to 
coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through 
the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, 
and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to 
say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an 
amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I 
believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and 
constantly refer to you as ""my good friend Winston who's skiing across the 
state of Wyoming, which was my idea."" I'd love to hear about your trip direct 
from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and 
killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write 
back....if you can still move your fingers.

3699,"Louise - thanks for forwarding.  Preliminary response as follows (I will need 
to follow up with Sanjev at Slaughter and May who is co-ordinating the 
European side):

1.  Regulation

We agree with the analysis. Securities laws will not be relevant.  Insurance 
is likey to be the main issue.  If it emerges from our legal review of the 
relevant countries that we can avoid the insurance point by making our 
contracts look like derivatives (swaps/options) that will determine whether 
the CFTC (commodity) regulations will be relevant.  For this reason, it makes 
sense to complete the survey before drafting the confirms (which in any event 
will be fairly simple). Note, though, that we will not be using ISDA 
documentation, since it is unnecessarily complex for the product contemplated 
(described below) and using the GTCs approach will tie in more neatly with 
OnLine.  

Of course we will also need to look at local regulation in each target 
jurisdiction.  SFA, for example, are taking an increased interest in the 
internet and have recently released a detailed questionnaire which we may 
need to complete before launch.

2.  The Product

From my most recent discussions with Bryan, the product will be a simple 
Bankruptcy only, digital payout.  That is, if the reference entity goes 
bankrupt (probably as defined under the laws of its jurisdiction of 
incorporation - local counsel will need to draft in each case) the protection 
seller will pay the buyer a fixed, pre-agreed sum of money (not determined by 
reference to the value of a bond or anything else).

3.  Bankruptcy

Please see 2 above.  Also note that we are looking for a harder (more 
certain) definition of bankruptcy which will be relatively easy to ascertain 
in each case.  Early warning type events will probably be out and court based 
or other formal proceedings which are readily verifiable will be in. In 
practice, this will make it harder for the buyer to claim than under the ISDA 
definition (for example) which is a far softer and more sensitive trigger.

4.  Confidentiality

Ken also raised this important point when we spoke yesterday.  There are 
issues of confidentiality which will be relevant.  While as a matter of UK 
regulation, a Chinese Wall/Restricted List procedure will not be required 
(since no securities will be involved), contractual duties of confidentiality 
will need to be considered.

The issue is perhaps more a commercial one - We will need to think carefully 
about the impact our public betting on the bankruptcy of our counterparties 
will or might have on our business relationships with them.

I'll come back with a ""legal game plan"" once Bryan, Sanjev and I have got 
together.

Best regards

Paul

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

_____________________________________________

I think that the ""general policies"" route is the right (and only) one - 
particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged.  From a 
legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all 
clear, provided
in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty 
of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc).  
We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not 
per se a legal task)
in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location
in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location

Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in 
the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as 
generically as possible.

3738,"Just a couple of comments on all the cc:mail traffic on the China LNG hedging 
presentation:

1)We need to do a complete credit check on all possible Chinese risk 
management counterparties.
2)We need to do a complete legal check on whether the Chinese counterparties 
can enter into a derivative transaction.
3)We need to have full support of EI/ECT management to even quote a risk 
management structure and price due to the size of the transaction,term of the 
transaction, possible delayed start, basis risk between JCC/Brent/WTI and any 
other counterparty risks.
4)ECT is willing and able to provide a person(s) to do a presentation to the 
Chinese counterparties. A sample presentation document is currently being 
prepared for the China LNG team.

Bottomline ECT is prepared to assist the Chinese LNG team so they can develop 
a competitive advantage in the region, but we cannot overlook the issues 
raised above. Please let me know how you want us to move forward on this 
subject.

Things have gone well this week.  I was able to et most of the 
personnel/administrative stuff out of the way.  (Thanx Keegan!).     Also, I 
located lots of background reading on everything I ever wanted to know about 
the swaps market and how we fit in.  With Tana""s help, I also watched the 
""deal tape"" which I found both amusing and informative.
 
I will be out of the office for most of this afternoon.   My recruiter is 
available this afternoon to take me around to secure a permanent apartment

Dear Western Region:

	I would like to thank Phillip Allen for his leadership of the west desk for 2000 and 2001.  He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group.  Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts.  I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately.

	I would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group.  I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward.   Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model.

The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.

West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.     

The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.
  
Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.  

Sincerely,

Michael D. Grigsby

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms

3784,"I have had several conversations with EPNG about the possibility of ENA turning back capacity to satisfy 1) requests for new capacity in the Power Up 2000 project and 2) any possible capacity that EPNG may need to provide to satisfy incremental needs of full requirements customers as they convert billing determinants to Contract Demand quantities.

In order to preserve our position, should I send a formal letter to Al Clark stating our desire to turn the capacity back? The Power Up 2000 deadline is noon, Thursday, August 2, 2001. They did not provide for turn back in the posting that is currently on the capacity system. While we do not know how EPNG will be forced to resolve their capacity issues in the receipt point allocation proceeding, I believe that a letter can help us preserve our position should we choose to turn back capacity under either scenario.

We have approx. 54,000 of Block I and III capacity and 200,000 of Block III capacity. The Block II capacity is subject to PG&E recall - PG&E paid approx. $58 million for those recall rights in a settlement. Could EPNG pay a negotiated sum of money for the remaining value of the recall rights to fund the needs full requirement customers? I have to believe this option would be cheaper than adding new  capacity.

Leslie - could you help me with the letter?

Many thanks!

If you remember, we looked at this issue back in March and I sent you the e-mail message below.  Since then, FERC has issued orders in Docket No. RP00-241 on 3/28/2001 and 6/11/2001 which reaffirmed its rulings in the orders discussed below.  There is no discussion in any of the orders on the specific mechanics of the recall other than what I already noted, namely, if the capacity has been recalled by El Paso or a shipper to serve a PG&E market, and the original shipper wants it back, it can re-recall the recalled capacity on 24 hours notice as long as it is using all of its other Block II capacity.  If you need something more ""legal"", we'll see what we can do.  If we have to go to Bracewell for a law firm legal opinion, there would be a charge since they'd have to do the same research before they could sign off on one.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an Enron Contract garage you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

Hi,

	My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk.  

	I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, derivatives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For example, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, gas, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building blocks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document.

 	We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.

Irrespective of availability, I still believe Salt River or APS will be the

better offer because contracts were not in place.  Enron North America does

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead 
The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week.
For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. 
NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience. 
""We don't expect a repeat of the record-breaking cold temperatures of November-December of last year, but this winter should be cooler than the warm winters of the late 1990s,"" said Scott Gudes, NOAA's acting administrator. ""Citizens should prepare for the full range of winter weather."" 
Climate factors that influenced last winter will play a similar role this season. They include the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest. 
""This winter, NOAA's improving technologies will help National Weather Service forecasters -- for the first time -- pinpoint when these factors will kick in and bring extreme weather,"" said Jack Kelly, director of NOAA's National Weather Service. 
Colder-than-normal temperatures are expected in the Northeast. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation. The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation, NOAA said. The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have an equal chance of averaging above normal, normal or below normal. 
In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal. The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. 
The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures. In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely. NOAA said to expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest (except western California) and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation.

her girlfriends when an exceptionally tall, handsome, extremely
sexy young man entered. He was so striking that the woman could
not take her eyes away from him. The young man noticed her overly-attentive 
stare and walked directly toward her. Before she could
offer her apologies for being so rude for staring, the young man
said to her. ""I'll do anything, absolutely anything,
that you want me to do, no matter how kinky, for $20. on one condition.""

Flabbergasted, the woman asked what the condition was. The young man
replied, ""You have to tell me what you want me to do in just three words.""

The woman considered his proposition for a moment, withdrew from
her purse and - slowly counted out four $5 bill, which she
pressed into the young man's hand along with her address. She
looked deeply into his eyes, and
