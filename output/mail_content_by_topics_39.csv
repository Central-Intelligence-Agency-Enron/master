 Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.  
It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to 
the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the 
rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or 
$20 to get things full, go ahead.

 I will be out of the office on Thursday.  I will talk to you on Friday.

Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you
gave us and move forward with this approach.

2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for Topics
reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
sign-off on each topic.

3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We will
meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
Monday with the room number.)

Have a good weekend.

Your spreadsheet shows the same type of return I was calculating.  Your insurance and repair numbers seem very low.   Also, assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith.  I don't believe these properties cost any where near the $150+/sf that they are being offered at.  

Based on the optimistic back loaded returns, I would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time.  Thank you anyway.

Also the majortiy of our buys and sells net out without exchanging actual transport contract numbers.  I know in the past Becky C. has worked with our back office to pull the data directly from the system.  Let me know if I need to do anything to assist gathering the data.

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you please email them to me as well?

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

36,"Hey John!

How are you??  I've been following the Enron story closely, which means I've
thought of you a lot recently.  I hope things are going well, despite the
uncertainty.

I ran into someone from our Enron days today, which made me think of a funny
story.  Do you remember when John Mee tried to eat 8 Big Macs and hurled
instead?  John was talking to my boss, Chuck Clough, today, who he's known
since childhood and is a mentor of sorts.  When he got off the phone, Chuck
told me who he was talking to and the name John Mee struck me as familiar.
I asked Chuck if he was a big kid who'd gone to Harvard and he said yes.  So
I tell him the Big Mac story and Chuck picks up the phone and calls John to
ask him if that was him because if so, I knew him.  Poor thing says ""yeah,
that was me, but not one of my finer moments...""  I could tell he was
embarrassed.  I guess there are some things in life you just never live
down.

I also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month.  We shared a
cab to the airport and realized we had all been at Enron, though not at the
same time.  I mentioned that I really loved the company, especially how
young it was and that I had a friend who joined right out of undergrad and
is now doing really well.  They immediately said ""John Arnold!""  Shocked the
hell out of me, honestly.  They were very funny in saying that I had made a
""bad trade"" by marrying my husband instead of you.  I told them I would keep
that in mind....  ;-}  I would tell you their names, but I can't remember
off the top of my head.  They both work for a weather trading firm in the
Northeast now, with Lynda Clemmons.

Well, gotta run to the gym - been putting it off as long as I could today.
I really do hope you're doing well.  Please drop me a line when you aren't
trading up a storm...

Warm regards,
Heather

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.

  The ISO has posted the following materials regarding CAISO's
Congestion Management Reform (CMR) Recommendation.

  Congestion Management Reform Recommendation (This is the
same as the version posted on July 11th with the exception that we have
corrected typographical errors.)

  Appendix A - Terminology and Acronyms A glossary of various
terms and acronyms used throughout the CMR Recommendation package.

  Appendix B - Locational Price Dispersion Study Summarizes
the areas of empirical study in which the ISO is currently engaged and
describes the objective, design, and preliminary results of the ISO's
analysis of the dispersion of locational prices throughout the ISO control
area.

  Appendix D - Assessment of CMR Design Recommendation with
Respect to Stakeholder Evaluation Criteria Compares the CMR Recommendation
against the specific evaluation criteria agreed to by the ISO and Market
Participants at the first stakeholder meetings.

  Appendix E - Congestion Management Redesign Options Not
Adopted in the CMR Recommendation

  Appendix G - System Impacts Summarizes the anticipated
impact of CMR Recommendation on the ISO's primary systems, such as SI/SA,
BBS, FTR, EMS, etc.  The purpose of this appendix is not to provide detailed
cost-benefit evaluation of the proposal, which we believe would be entirely
subjective and of little value.

  Appendix H - Intra-Zonal Congestion Management Mitigation
Costs During 1999  and Their Application to Local Reliability Areas.

  It is our intent to publicly distribute Appendix C, as
identified below, by mid August.  In the final draft of
  the recommendation package, to be publicly distributed and
provided to the Board in late August, we will
  provide the following additional appendices as well as
updated versions of those identified above.

  Appendix C - Market Separation Study The objectives, design,
and preliminary results of the other ongoing study being undertaken in
connection with the Congestion Management Reform process.

  Appendix F - Summary of Stakeholder Comments of California
ISO Congestion Management Proposals A summary of all stakeholder comments
received to date on the various proposals and concepts incorporated into
this recommendation package.

  You can find these Appendices along with the original
proposal and feedback form  at

83,"Latest News on Denver QB Brian Griese:

http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/broncos/wed.htm  Denver Broncos
quarterback Brian Griese, the AFC's top-rated passer, might be lost for the
regular season with a severely separated throwing shoulder.

''He'll be out a minimum of three weeks,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan said
Tuesday.

The news stunned the Broncos, who watched Monday night as Griese shook off
the injury and led his team back into the AFC West race by knocking off
first-place Oakland 27-24.

Griese, already playing with cartilage damage in his right shoulder,
suffered a third-degree separation while being chased out of bounds in the
first quarter. Griese, whose first shoulder injury this season also was vs.
the Raiders, returned after taking a pain-killing injection.

''When they told me that I might be out three, four, five weeks, I said, 'If
that's the case, put me back in there so I can play one more time,' '' he
said.



In the ""Here we go again"" department, RB Terrell Davis was noticeably
limping after Monday Night's game.  From the same USA Today article : ""Also
in question are the status of Terrell Davis, who was limping noticeably
after the game, and guard Mark Schlereth, who could be headed for yet
another knee surgery in what likely is his final season. Davis, in fact,
revealed that his left foot had been bothering him the past 2-3 weeks. ""

I had also heard reports he was bothered by a calf problem.  Not sure
whether it's the foot or the calf (or both) and it's not clear yet whether
the injury is serious enough to be a factor this weekend.  I'll keep you
posted and just wanted to give you the headsup.

88,"Hi Folks,

Getting an avalanche of email on this so thought I'd share my thoughts on
how I see this Jimmy Smith business shaking out.   This is strictly my
opinion here.

First off, I'll stay totally out of the issue of casting any moral
judgements.   That's not my place and that's not why you subscribe.   I'm
only interested (because I know YOU'RE primarily interested) in how this
affects his Fantasy Football status.

I could care less about a fine.   The real issue is whether the league could
take action in the form of a suspension.   It's my opinion that this is
highly unlikely to happen this season.   For a number of reasons.

First, Smith is widely regarded as one of the league's ""Good Guys"".   Rest
assured, the NFL is first and foremost, a business and like any business,
the league takes it's image very seriously.   There's a reason big bucks are
spent on all the (outstanding) feel good commercials featuring players
lately.   Smith is known as a good guy with lots of charity work.   Plus, he
has the amazing story regarding his health this summer.   He's a poster guy.
It's my understanding that this is a first time offense for him.   The fact
that a respected coach like Tom Coughlin is staunchly behind him helps.   By
far, the best Public Relations move for the league is that this be swept
under the rug.

Secondly, there's the evidence itself.   While the NFL has a pretty large
(and vague) ""Good of the League"" directive to work within, the evidence of a
urine test seems sketchy to me.   Especially as it was not administered by
the league.   There is of course the possibility for false positives in such
a test.   An even bigger factor in Smith's favor is that he will not be
charged with any crime.

Thirdly, is the timing.   I doubt the league is in any hurry to throw the
book at Smith.   Any action that might result would likely be something that
is carefully weighed with the ever present thought of the league protecting
itself from litigation.   Therefore, even if something serious were to arise
from this, I have a hard time seeing it happening within the next few weeks.
Not to be too callous about our game of Fantasy Football, but I honestly
care a lot more about this between now and week 17.   I'd be surprised to
see some sort of swift action taken.

Bottom line:   If I were a Jimmy Smith owner, I believe I'd sit tight.
While embarrassing, I don't see a lot of real live jeopardy there for him.
That's my opinion.   If you had a Smith owner in your league who is
panicking over this, I would have no problem letting him believe what he
chooses to believe and maybe scooping up Smith if the price is very
attractive.   Again, just my thoughts.

Thanks to our friend Tom Kessinich from Krause Publications for letting me
bounce some of these things off him.

Have a great week.

Joe

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Chris Warren , RB PHI - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Warren arrived in Philadelphia on Friday, and practiced with the Eagles on 
Saturday. Although he hasn't had a lot of time to get familiar with the 
offensive scheme, he could get some action against Cleveland on Sunday. We 
wouldn't recommend starting him during the Fantasy playoffs this week, 
however.  

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Although Watters didn't practice all week because of a bad case of turf toe, 
Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said he will start Sunday against Denver. Watters 
is not on the injury report and medical reports say the toe is fine.  

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.

96,"Dear Eric,

We scored a major victory for election integrity this past
Sunday when Florida certified the election results in George
W. Bush's favor.  I want to thank you for being one of the
325,000 plus Americans who joined the petition campaign at
ElectionIntegrity2000.com to ""Certify the Bush
Victory.""

Unfortunately, Al Gore has flatly refused to accept the fair
and just election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a
calculated course of action intended to overturn the will of
the voters and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in
these actions are his attempts to attack and discredit
military absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while
simultaneously using manipulative ""hand-counting"" techniques
to convert so-called ""dimpled chads"" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers a
clear majority of American citizens.

That's why Election Integrity 2000 has started up a new
campaign to collect online letters and send them to Al Gore
urging him to concede the election NOW!

Al Gore always claims to be ""listening to the will of the
people.""  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

But just in case this isn't enough, we'll also be sending daily
press releases to the leaders in the House and Senate as well
as the major news media informing them about the overwhelming
response we are receiving from American people demanding that
Al Gore concede.

Eric, this is a personalized message just for you.
Please go to the link at the bottom of this message to sign your
letter to Al Gore.

Do NOT forward this e-mail.

In the couple of hours, I'll send you another e-mail for you
to forward to every friend who might be interested in sending a
message to Al Gore that America wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

97,"Hi Folks,

Another wild week in the NFL.   We've got Footballguy Scott Luebke's Week 7
Upgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks.

Before we get to that though, let me throw out something I posted today on
our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing
themselves.   This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent
memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear.

From our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com

One of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching
Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams
fared less well as his starters.

My reply to him:

Don't be down on yourself.   That's the nature of the game.   There is no
way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was
such a question mark last week.   You did what just about every one of us
would have done I'm guessing.

It's part of the game.   Is it frustrating?   Sure it is.   But it's still
part of the game.   In my local league last week, I took a chance again on
Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 -
Aargh... )   Did it play out?   No, it didn't.   I had guys on my bench who
outscored him.   But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and
Billy Schroeder, it was the right call for me.

I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football.   You just have to
take the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do
the rest.   Just like a real GM.   You can only do so much.

If you got beat because you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started
him, well, that's your bad.   But if you got beat because Trung Canidate
decided to play the game of his life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did
not, well, that's not your fault.

I promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit
your job and head to Vegas.

Control what you can control.   Bust your butt to know all you can know.
Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've done all you
can do.   After that, just enjoy the games.   Trust me, you'll be a better
owner because of it.

Ok, let's jump to Scott's report for this week.

Have a great week, everyone.

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades


QB - Tom Brady (Waiver Wire) - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks
deserves an upgrade in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an
interception this season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots'
coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make.   There's even
some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season.   Right now, Brady
deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.

QB - Tim Couch - The yardage numbers won't win any awards, but the 4
touchdowns in the last 2 games is impressive.  Couch is starting to show
signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league.  Keep in mind, a
tough schedule looms ahead for Couch.  However, with the Browns offense
improving, he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper
league looking towards the future.

QB - Doug Flutie - The Flutie magic continues to strike.  He's not the best
fantasy quarterback, but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting
Flutie into the lineup.  With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy,
Flutie should be considered a top 15 quarterback this season.  With a strong
rushing game keeping defenses honest, look for Flutie to post numbers
similar to Sunday on occasion.  280 passing yards and 2 scores is
respectable against a tough Denver defense.

RB - Anthony Thomas -The A-Train continues to ride into fantasy starting
lineups.  We've been hyping him for weeks and it appears he'll be named the
official starter in Chicago shortly.  With 188 yards and a touchdown on
Sunday, can the Bears afford to keep him out of the lineup?  I think not.

RB - Trung Canidate - Faulk owners need not worry about using Canidate as a
filler.  232 total yards and 2 touchdowns...WOW!   At the very least he'll
see more action even when Faulk is back.

RB - Jerome Bettis - Bettis has rolled to 4 consecutive 100-yard games.
Look for this trend to continue.  With the Steelers defense playing
excellent and Kordell Stewart limiting turnovers, look for Bettis to have
more good games as the season progresses.

RB - Michael Pittman - We told you to jump off the Thomas Jones bandwagon
and hop on the Pittman express earlier in the season.   With Pittman seeing
80% of the carries and more importantly producing, all looks good for
Pittman owners.  I've never been an advocate of starting Cardinals' running
backs though.  After his 137 total yards and a touchdown performance, now
may be the time to deal Pittman.

RB - Jason Brookins (Waiver Wire) - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all
Brookins needs to become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good
running behind a pretty solid offensive line, but his carries have been
limited due to Allen's presence.  Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting
other teams about trading for another back prior to the trade deadline.
Right now, Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice.

WR - David Patten (Waiver Wire) - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for
a touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being
bothered by a hamstring injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He
has looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make
plays, which is needed in the Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in
need of a receiver.

WR - David Terrell (Waiver Wire) - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday
with 7 catches for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus
Robinson suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The
Robinson injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup.
If you're in need of a receiver, Terrell is the best option in the free
agent market, if he is still available.

WR - Keyshawn Johnson - Johnson has yet to score a touchdown this season,
but he is doing everything else.  Johnson is averaging 8 catches/game and
appears unstoppable at times.  However, he did suffer a hip flexor injury
late in the game and appears questionable for this week's game.

WR - Johnnie Morton - Morton continues to impress this season.  He has
surpassed the 100-yard mark 3 times this season and scored 3 touchdowns.
With Germane Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season, Morton becomes the
team's #1 wide receiver.  Morton owners should be happy.

WR - David Boston - Plain and simple, Boston is bigger, faster and better
than any defensive back on the field.  In his first 5 games, Boston is
averaging 96 receiving yards/game.  Keep him in your lineup every week.

WR - Jeff Graham - With the San Diego running game and LaDainian Tomlinson
garnering a lot of attention, the receiving corps is able to see plenty of
open spaces downfield.  Graham scored his first two touchdowns of the season
and gained 107 yards on Sunday.  With defenses focusing on Tomlinson, look
for Flutie to find Graham for 5-6 more touchdown passes this season.

WR - Rod Gardner (Waiver Wire) - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible,
Gardner is impressing on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a
touchdown (with another score called back), Gardner is starting to claim the
title of ""best rookie receiver"".  Grab him, if he is available in your
league.  Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game.

TE - Bubba Franks - Franks has been diagnosed with Cris Carter disease
because ""All he does is catch touchdowns"".  6 touchdowns in 6 games.  If
only he can start picking up yardage points.

TE - Cam Cleeland - Cleeland scored another touchdown on Sunday to increase
the total to 4 scores this season.  With Aaron Brooks struggling to find his
wide receivers in the red zone, Cleeland's value should remain high for a
little while longer.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downgrades


QB - Aaron Brooks - Brooks has been struggling trying to find his receivers,
especially in the red zone.  With just 4 touchdowns in his last 4 games,
Brooks is in a minor slump.  There's no need to jump off his bandwagon.  On
the flip side, an upturn in production is possible over the next 4 weeks as
New Orleans faces: St. Louis, NY Jets, San Francisco and Indianapolis.  But
for now, we're a little worried and Brooks needs to be downgraded with our
fingers crossed to see him upgraded starting next week.

QB - Elvis Grbac - Two injuries in two weeks have Grbac downgraded once
again this week.  Without a consistent running game, look for Grbac's
struggles to continue.  For now, Grbac is expected to be listed as
questionable for this week's game against Jacksonville.

QB - Charlie Batch - With 338 yards and 3 touchdowns, many would think that
Batch deserves an upgrade.  Well, if the box scores were the only thing
studied, this would be the case.  However, the season ending injury to
Batch's #1 receiving option, Germane Crowell, gives Batch a downgrade in my
book.  With both Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season, Batch must
rely on Johnnie Morton and Larry Foster as his starting receivers...not a
good sign.

QB - Vinny Testaverde - Testaverde was unable to get anything going against
the Rams on Sunday.  With the Rams leading by a significant margin,
Testaverde was benched in order to get Chad Pennington some playing time.
All in all, not a good sign for Testaverde owners.  Testaverde's yardage
numbers are poor this season.  However, he has thrown for multiple
touchdowns in 3 of his 6 games this season.

RB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn suffered a hamstring strain on Sunday against the
Steelers.  Look for Dunn to be listed as questionable on the injury report
this week.  With the Vikings mediocre defense coming to town, Dunn's owners
can't be very happy with this recent turn of events.  Joe's email updates
will keep you posted on the latest Dunn news.

RB - Michael Bennett - Chapman was able to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries
during Sunday's game versus Green Bay.  This is bad news for the
unproductive, injured Bennett.  With Bennett failing to clear the 60-yard
mark this season, his starting job is in jeopardy.  Keep an eye on this
situation.

RB - James Stewart - Stewart suffered an ankle sprain in Sunday's loss to
the Titans.  He was limited to 17 yards on 9 carries before leaving the
game.  Expect him to be listed as questionable for this week's game.  As
more of a straight ahead runner, Stewart may be able to play on the injury
and be somewhat effective.  With this week's game on astroturf, the Lions
may decide to rest Stewart and get him back to 100% health.  Regardless, any
kind of injury to an often injured player deserves a downgrade.

RB - Tim Biakabatuka - Biakabatuka suffered a broken foot and is lost for
the season.

RB - Terry Allen - Allen was limited to 12 yards on 3 carries after
suffering an ankle injury on Sunday.  Backup Jason Brookins replaced Allen
and looked decent.  If Allen misses any action, Brookins may replace him as
the team's starter with one good performance.  The Ravens are exploring
trade options for another running back prior to the trade deadline, so the
Ravens RB situation is cloudy at the current time.

RB - James Allen - We've been hyping Anthony Thomas for weeks and it appears
he will soon be named the official starting RB in Chicago.  Plain and
simple, Allen has been horrible this season.  With Thomas gaining 188 yards
on 22 carries, Allen will be relegated to spot duty.

RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson was limited to 58 yards on 25 carries
and 0 touchdowns against a stingy Broncos defense.  It was bound to happen
that a team would shut down Tomlinson.  Tomlinson owners should be happy
that he received 25 carries despite being ineffective.  Just a slight
downgrade to show he's human.  Keep him in your lineup.

WR - Marcus Robinson - Robinson suffered a torn ACL and MCL and is lost for
the season.

WR - Germane Crowell - Crowell suffered a torn patella tendon and is lost
for the season.

WR - Terry Glenn - Currently, Glenn is suffering from a hamstring strain
that he suffered in last week's practice.  He missed Sunday's game and
witnessed the ""David Patten Show"".  With Patten showcasing his playmaking
skills, look for Glenn's touches to be reduced when he returns from injury.
Previously, Glenn was considered the only playmaker on the Patriots offense.
Glenn can post dazzling numbers, but his inconsistency has hurt fantasy
owners in the past and this should once again be the case this season.

WR - Darney Scott - Scott's role in the Bengals' offense has seemingly been
reduced in the last few weeks.  After suffering a rib injury that forced
Scott out of Sunday's game, Kitna started finding Peter Warrick on a
consistent basis.  With Kitna starting to build a rapport with the talented
2nd year wideout from Florida St., Scott now appears to be the team's second
option in the passing game.

WR - Marvin Minnis - Minnis has been non existent in the Chiefs offense
since week 1.  With Sylvester Morris out for the season, Minnis looked ready
to take over the role and produce quality numbers.  With Trent Green
struggling at quarterback, Minnis' fantasy impact has been minimal at best.
If Minnis is a starter on your roster, your receiving corps needs some
serious help.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire


QB - Tom Brady - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an upgrade
in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception this
season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff will
have a very difficult decision to make.  Right now, Brady deserves a pickup
by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.

RB - Richard Huntley - Huntley has been named the team's starter after the
season ending foot injury to Tim Biakabatuka.  It was only a matter of time
before Biakabatuka would get injured or benched again.  With the Panthers
facing the Jets pitiful run defense this week, Huntley should pay instant
dividends.

RB - Doug Chapman - Chapman was able to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries in
replacement of the injured Michael Bennett.  With the unproductive Bennett
suffering from an ankle injury, Chapman will be given the chance to earn the
team's starting running back job.  Grab him, if he is available.

RB - Jason Brookins - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all Brookins needs
to become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good running behind
a quality offensive line, but his carries have been limited due to Allen's
presence.  Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading
for another back prior to the trade deadline.  Right now, Brookins is a
solid waiver wire choice.

WR - David Patten - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for a touchdown
in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being bothered by a
hamstring injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He has looked
good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays, which
is needed in the Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in need of a
receiver.

WR - David Terrell - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with 7 catches
for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus Robinson
suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The Robinson
injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup.  If you're
in need of a receiver, Terrell is the best option in the free agent market,
if he is still available.

WR - Rod Gardner - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible, Gardner is
impressing on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a touchdown (with
another score called back), Gardner is starting to claim the title of ""best
rookie receiver"".  Grab him, if he is available in your league.  Gardner is
the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game.

WR - Larry Foster - With Herman Moore and Germaine Crowell out for the
season, the Lions will insert Larry Foster into the lineup.  Foster is a
talented receiver out of LSU with playmaking skills.  If you are in a deep
league and in need of receiver help, give Foster a shot on your team.

11:22 02Aug2001 RSF-Ill. Quad Cities 2 nuke shut after lightning strike

    NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Exelon Nuclear said Thursday a lightning strike at the Quad Cities plant in Cordova, Ill. caused a fire in unit 2's main transformer that caused the 789-megawatt (MW) unit to shut down.
    Exelon said in a statement that the fire was quickly extinguished at 8:45 a.m. Central Time by the site's fire brigade and the Cordova Fire Department. The lightning strike occurred at about 8:15 a.m.
    With the loss of the off-site power during the event, Exelon declared an ""Unusual Event"" at 8:23 a.m. An Unusual Event is the lowest of four emergency classifications used by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to categorize events at commercial nuclear power plants.
    Exelon said there were no injuries and no potential for a radioactivity release as a result of the fire. The main transformer is located outside the plant.
    Exelon said the adjacent 789-MW unit 1 continues to operate at a slightly reduced power level.

130,"While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.  ","Lexi Elliott Shelley Jones Lexi Shelley James Scribner Shelley

135,"We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th 
floor.  Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to 
densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property 
Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.   In the mean 
time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the 
capacity on the floor.  While these locations are not prime spots, people 
will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.  Once the window 
seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign 
groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.

I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while 
she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations 
personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.  Susan Harrison is 
working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition 
period.  Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and 
equipment on the 30th floor.  If there are any problems once a move has 
occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, 
printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also 
coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.  If Chantelle is not 
available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.  Maria can be reached at Ext. 
3-5586.

I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the 
window spaces.  We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and 
supplies on the floor.  Please coordinate with your assistant to have your 
area cleaned up by December 31.  During this clean-up process, if you have 
any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn 
Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she 
will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a 
neat and professional work environment.  Between now and the summer of 2001 
when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are 
all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.  I would greatly 
appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available 
space effectively.

to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them.

144,"Once the Arcos plant in Spain is financially closed (expected in Q2 of this 
year) Eric Gonzales will be moving back to Houston to work exclusively on 
co-managing Enron's LNG markets.   We are very appreciative of Eric's efforts 
in Europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very 
closely with his LNG team in the coming years.  From this point forward Eric 
will focus his remaining time in Europe exclusively on financially closing 
Arcos.

We are therefore making the following changes immediately.   The origination 
responsibility for Italy will be moved under  Eric Shaw.  Ricardo Bortolloti 
will continue in the role as Italian Country Manager and will report to Eric 
Shaw.   Mariano Gentilini will become our Country Manager for Spain and 
Portugal and will report directly to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.

The Arcos Power Project is likely to create a large gas to power spread 
position and so we have asked Paul Mead to assume the added responsibility 
for our natural gas risk positions in Spain.  This position is much more 
likely to be supplied and influenced by LNG rather than Continental Gas 
markets and Paul will  work quite closely with both Enron Global Markets and 
the Continental Gas team.

Ross Sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in Holland will also 
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power 
transmission opportunities across Europe.   Among the prospects his team will 
pursue include projects  from Norway to the UK,  Sweden to the Continent,  
and bidding on existing French interconnector capacity.   He will report  to 
Eric Shaw for the Holland markets and to Richard Lewis for the Transmission 
responsibilities.

Finally the Continental Gas team is interacting far more with our UK gas team 
than our power teams on the Continent.  Therefore David Galagher who manages 
our Continental Gas team  will now report directly to Richard Lewis.

We have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that  these 
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance.  Please help 
make these changes as smooth as possible.

time.  I think we have it backwards for James to dictate how and when Todd's 
help would be needed.  I think that we can review the ""to do"" list from James 
and get back with him on how much of that we can help with, who would do it, 
what the timing would be, how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing 
the work, etc.  As I said originally, I knew that Todd would not be 
interested (nor available) for a month's worth of work.  Todd's tendency 
(remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the 
work himself.  He has had enough experience that his organization, guidance 
and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work 
himself.  If James' list looks long and involved, how could Todd lead these 
efforts, what kind of team might he ask James to provide, what additional 
short-term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston, etc.  We have 
to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James.  If 
you are willing, I would be glad to explore this with Todd and challenge him 
to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all 
of the work.  I want him to think like a consultant on these projects, not as 
the contracted hired help!  Let me know what you think.  --Sally

171,"I will commit to writing the three items that I had hoped to discuss with you 
today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would 
prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from 
December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I 
will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years. 

1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all 
systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at 
your Enron number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you 
will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several 
key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed 
our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we 
trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will 
naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.  
Please let me know your preference for notification.  

2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft 
memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination 
role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that 
should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick 
know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss 
this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) 
This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the 
needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control 
and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have 
your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to 
jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and 
some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best 
position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.    



3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but 
I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants 
logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to 
""look like power"".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what  
the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to 
Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the 
regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable 
information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central 
and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is 
built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report 
to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and 
West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, 
confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very 
closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that 
the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of 
volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction 
in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in 
logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our 
ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent 
will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.  
While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an 
earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that 
either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong 
front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding 
logistics accountable for their part in this.  

I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on 
this issue.   ","Rick Causey Rick

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

Did you resolve to improve productivity, cut down on travel, or to spend more time with family members and friends in 2002? Audioconferencing just might be your solution. But, audioconferencing isn't always as simple as it seems. Consider the following tips when you pick up the phone for that next meeting. 

Leader	

Pick an appropriate time for the meeting. Avoid lunchtime hours, if possible. 
Be prompt and end on time. 
Conduct a roll call. 
For large audiences, use Listen Only mode, which mutes all participants until they're queued to talk. Also use an attended service level, which offers a conference coordinator to help manage the call. 
To share a PowerPoint presentation, use Net Conferencing. Participants view the presentation on the Web while listening to you on an audioconference. You control the pace of the presentation and it ensures that participants don't jump ahead. 
If a follow-up meeting is required, select a mutual time and date before the call is over. Follow-up via e-mail. 

Leader & Participants	

Speak clearly and avoid outside conversations or background noise. 
Identify yourself by name when speaking and address other individuals by name. 
Use your voice effectively; vary the tone and pace. 
Use the mute button if you are not speaking. If you do not have access to a mute button, press *6 on your telephone keypad to mute and unmute yourself. 

Receive a Free Web RSVP!
Effective February 1, schedule a domestic attended-level audioconference or Net conference, add Instant Replay PlusSM, and you'll receive a free Web RSVP -- up to $100!* Instant Replay Plus allows individuals who missed your meeting access to a digital recording that they can listen to at their convenience. Web RSVP is our Internet-based registration tool that allows conference leaders to collect and view participant information online. Check out our Web site for more information!

pean markets and closed around 1.5 points higher on the week. The long awai=
ted resignation of the Minister of Public Works added to the positive senti=
ment in the market. The Russian market rallied this week, first on the back=
 of Latam stabilisation and then encouraged by the Moody's rating upgrade (=
see below). Prices peaked on Thursday, immediately after the upgrade, but f=
ailed to stay at those levels due to profit taking and a sliding Latam mark=
et, closing only one point higher than last Friday. Central and Eastern Eur=
opean investment grade assets remained stable throughout the week, which is=
 a good sign given the sell-off in US Treasuries. Other countries in this r=
egion gained around ? point, with Romania being the best performer gaining =

227,"As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB 
liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented 
below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred 
6/29/00.

Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the 
cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water 
mixture).  Diesel was not used in the deconning process.  The only equipment 
cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.  Transwestern's filters in its separator 
were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit.   
The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator.

The following samples were collected during this project:

On the Transwestern side:

 1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters 
were removed.  Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of   
PCB's.  (Not 100 sq. cm. sample)

 2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator 
at the Selexol Plant.  The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 

 3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the 
bottom of the F/S.   Approximte volume one cup.  
 
 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of 
the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually 
unstained.  A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter 
confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 

 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.  This was a control sample. 


On the PG&E side:

 1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter 
separator prior to deconning.  Approx. volume one cup

 2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the 
F/S.  An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior 
to deconning was approximately one gallon.

 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 
cm sq. wipe)

 4. Used filter media from the F/S.  The operation of the F/S filters are 
designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.  Composite samples   
were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters.

 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. 

The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process 
was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material 
which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount 
of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .  As 
previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.  The only 
difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the 
volume.  It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 
99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had 
over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.  The small amount of rust 
materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging 
activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.  I will have 
reprensentataive samples of both materials.  

Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and 
will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with 
PG&E.
on the 13th of July.  Analytical results will also be completed at this time.

pueblo regarding Transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to 
address and remove PCB contamination from the groundwater at the facility.

You may remember, we had a meeting in January to hear the Laguna's concerns 
that Transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site.  This 
letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that 
remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively

232,"I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to 
submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency 
originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the 
TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the 
emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are 
the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 
inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 
tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would 
submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The 
only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an 
increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this 
facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from 
the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that 
the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I 
have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed 
for this facility in the near future.  

In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if 
there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit 
on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with 
previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that 
this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 
(emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed 
from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating 
throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make 
written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.

234,"As per your request, an environmental due diligence was completed of the 
assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a 
local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in 
Portand, Oregon.  This  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9, 
2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures 
which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the 
environmental risks associated with each issue.  A relative risk number 
between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential 
risk impact.  A rating of ""0"" indicates that there is no risk associated with 
this regulation or issue and a rating of ""3"" indicates a major problem or an 
issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.  An approximate cost  
value has also been assigned to each discipline.   It is to be understood and 
explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative 
estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or 
formally close each issue. 

Presented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact 
and affect NWNG.  The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is 
based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG 
personnel.  Therefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of 
information presented.

General Pipeline Characteristics ;

This is a dry pipeline system.  No pipeline liquids are generated, only small 
volumes of compressor oils are collected.
All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.  There is still approx. 
100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future.  
The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage, 
and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity). 
this is a non Title V major source.
NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their 
underground storage capacity. 
NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of 
2002.  All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the 
agencies.
Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.  NWNG has 
completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas.    

Environmental Procedures Manual.   The NWNG environmental procedures manual  
appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.  The topics 
covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company 
appeared to be involved with.  The manual addressed waste management, 
permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.  There was also a written 
statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to 
enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG. 
Risk: 0  Cost: $0

Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).   In a summary 
page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against 
the company was available.  Although the company had received a few  notices 
(<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small 
recordkeeping and right of way issues.  There were no outstanding judgements, 
NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved.  
Risk: 0  Cost: $0 

PCBs.  In interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have 
never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected.  
Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company, 
the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown.
Risk:  1  Cost: $0        

Mercury.   Mercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and 
not in natural gas metering equipment.  A decision was made by environmental 
management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.  An investigation 
has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers 
or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment 
which may have been used. 
Risk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000

Onsite Disposal.  Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas 
plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not 
aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous 
waste.
Risk:   1  Cost:   undefined

Hazardous Waste.  There is only one location where hazardous waste is 
generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is 
used.  This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity 
generator.  The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous 
waste.
Risk: 0  Cost:  0 

NORMS.  The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually 
occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline 
system.  Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does 
NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company.
Risk:  1  Cost:  $500

Underground Storage Tanks (UST).  There is only one regulated underground 
storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in 
complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and 
recordkeeping.  All other underground tanks have been removed.  At one of the 
tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.  Closure 
of this site is expected in the near future.
Risk: 1  Cost: $500

LNG plants.  In interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no 
histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural 
gas (LNG)  plants.  The exception to this is a historic site of a 
manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.  This 
issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas 
Plant. 
Risk: 0  Cost:  $0

Manufactured Gas Plants.  NWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured 
gas plants (MGPs).  Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had 
operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks.

 Eugene Water and Electrical Board. The City of Eugene has determined that  a 
parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous 
responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time 
period of 1958-1976.  The Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is 
the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean 
the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has 
indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.  NWNG has offered to pay 
compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all 
liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City 
of Eugene.   The environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB 
has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately 
$94,000.
 Risk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000

 Salem Site. According to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been 
remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the   
regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.  NWNG has received 
endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature.  
 Risk: 1   Cost: $0

 Manufactured Gas Plant. This site, which ceased operation in the early 
1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.  From the time the facility ceased  
operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail 
bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park.  
The site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial 
watercourse in Oregon.  There have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river 
sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts.  
NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds 
of  London.  The insurance policies were not available at the time of this 
due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this 
site.
 Risks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000

Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Environmetnal Protection Agency has 
determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received 
contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify 
the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.  This superfund site extends 
for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites, 
originally owned by NWNG.  The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary 
responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the 
contamination of this section of the Willamette River.  NWNG has been 
identified as a contributing member to the contamination.

 Linnton MGP/Wacker Site.   The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of 
water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland 
Harbor Superfund Site.  The Linnton facility, which originally included the 
Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956.   
During the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar 
wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non  
aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.  Characteristically these 
waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and 
cyanide.  During the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were 
originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in  
1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.  Preliminary 
investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility 
operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil 
underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6 
million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.   It was also estimated from these 
reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed 
with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds.  

 Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more 
years.  NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of 
London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion 
of this superfund responsibility.  The policies were not availble during the 
due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.  Additionally, 
because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the 
subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not 
been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be 
evaluated.   It  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate 
extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance 
coverage  appears to be somewhat premature.

Phoenix, Arizona 85012

Re: Transwestern Pipeline, Permits No. 1001601 & 1001602
        Schedule for Permits Issuance

Dear Ms. Wrona;

Thank you again for your significant assistance in detailing a specific 
strategy to complete the process to review and approve the two permit 
revisions for the Transwestern Pipeline compressor stations near Kingman and 
Flagstaff. We were impressed with your willingness and ability to focus on 
the practical approach to improving Arizona's air quality as promptly as 
possible. Working with you and your team of Cathy O'Connell and Prabhat 
Barghava gave our team from Enron Transportation Services and Transwestern 
Pipeline Company (TWP) a strong sense of accomplishment and cooperation.

Following is the schedule that we detailed for subsequent activities:
1. By Friday morning, October 5, Prabhat and Shudeish Mahadev will have 
completed the draft permits; on Friday afternoon, October 5, the ADEQ team, 
including Prabhat and Cathy O'Connell, will conduct the internal review and 
the TSD; by close of business, Friday, October 5, ADEQ will email the draft 
permits revisions to the TWP team (Bill Kendrick, Larry Campbell and me; our 
contact numbers and email addresses are listed on the attached sheet).

2. On Tuesday morning, October 9, at 9 am Phoenix time, there will be a 
call-in conference call between the ADEQ and the TWP teams for final review, 
negotiation, and agreement on the terms and conditions of the draft permits 
revisions.

3. By Thursday, October 11, or Friday, October 12, ADEQ will do first 
publication in the daily newspapers in Mohave and Coconino Counties of the 
30-day public comment period and 30-day notice of a public hearing (at TWP's 
request) for both permits revisions in Williams AZ. Toward meeting the 
agreed-upon permits revisions schedule, TWP hereby requests a hearing on each 
revision pursuant to R18-2-330(E) and asks that ADEQ include the required 
notices of hearing in all notices of the public's opportunity to comment 
pursuant to R18-2-330(C) and ARS sec 49-444(A). Second publication will occur 
a week later. We will research and confirm the mechanics for getting the 
notices published as soon as possible after the Tuesday, October 9 conference 
call; ADEQ will promptly prepare the form of notice, unless you wish TWP to 
do it.

4. On Tuesday, November 13, ADEQ will conduct the public hearing on the two 
permit revisions in Williams AZ. We have found nothing in the statutes or 
rules that would prevent having back-to-back hearings for the Kingman and 
Flagstaff facilities' permits revisions in the same place.

5. Promptly after the October 9 conference call that finalizes the draft 
permits revisions, ADEQ will send the drafts to EPA Region IX to commence 
EPA's review. TWP will confer with the EPA contacts to shorten the maximum 45 
days allowed so that EPA will complete its review on or before Thursday, 
November 15; EPA will promptly notify ADEQ of its approval.

6. On the assumption that neither the public hearing nor the EPA review 
generated any substantive comments that require further review, ADEQ will 
issue the permits revisions by Friday, November 16.

We recognize that the foregoing schedule will require significant cooperation 
among all parties, as well as working closely with EPA, but we are confident, 
based upon yesterday's meeting, that all of us from ADEQ and from TWP are 
committed to making this doable schedule work. The TWP team will promptly 
convey to ADEQ all materials it receives relating to the EPA permits 
revisions for the Leupp and Klagetoh facilities.

We also appreciated your clarification of the facilities-related activities 
that we can proceed with prior to final permits issuance. Specifically, since 
there will be no emissions impacts from the routine maintenance of replacing 
equipment and making the srubbers' tie-ins, TWP can proceed with those 
activities at the Kingman and Flagstaff sites. Additionally, we can proceed 
with the off-site fabrication of piping.

We also understand that, at the time of the first newspaper notices, we will 
post the appropriate signs at each facility duplicating the newspaper notices.

Again, thank you very much for your assistance in setting up the foregoing

I just spoke with Steve Burr (he had been in Kingman last two days dealing 
with county air issues and town council). He was unequivocal that we could 
not construct buildings and foundations because these are ""activities ... of 
a permanent nature."" This phrasing is from the definition of ""begin actual 
construction"" (ARS 49-401.01(5)), which is not allowed for modificastion of a 
major source until the permit is issued. In our discussion last week, Steve 
was suggesting that we could do this if we had a ""minor"" source, but Larry 
corrected our thinking, stating  that the equipment emits more than 250 tons 
per yr NOx, which is the threshhold between ""major"" and ""minor"" source.
Our strategy now is to make sure that everyone keeps to the schedule, as set 
forth in your Sept 28 letter to Nancy. It will be especially important to 
send the EPA materials to Prabhat (copy of cover letter to Nancy and Cathy, 
copy also me) as quickly as possible and then to make sure that the meetings 
scheduled for this Friday (Oct 5) occur; let me know if I can help bird-dog 
anything.
When Sara can get me more details about the Idaho ""fast-track"" policy, I will 
pass this on to Steve Burr to see if there is any interest in integrating 
some of these ideas for natural gas transmission lines, which is the shortage 
problem in Arizona (current glut is built/permitted/under construction 
generation facilities).

A meeting was held in Roswell to discuss air permitting activites and the 
recent agency inspection of the TW Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Due to the agenciy's 
portable testing of units at the AToka No. 2 and 3 C/S, A plan was developed 
to address potential actions which may result from the agency testing.  Also 
discussed was NSPS fuel gas monitoring for nitrogen and sulfur and other 
miscellaneous air issues.  

Texaco has initiated soil excavation of an abondoned pit which may be the 
source of groundwater contamination at the NNG Eunice C/S.  An Enron  
contractor is onsite to oversee the activities by Texaco and to assist in the 
results of the investigation.

The 3rd request to Region VI EPA was completed requesting approval of 5 
Transwestern and 1 NNG facilities for custom fuel monitoring schedules.  
Initial requests dating back to 10/8/98 were included with the packet.  A 
phone call to the Regional Administer of Region VI was also completed.  
Pending additional lack of response,   a meeting will be requested to the

Effective Tuesday November 21, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a Demand Mismatch Order for these three additional primary 
pools; VALDOSTA, SAVANNAH, BRUNSWICK
Therefore , starting  Tuesday November 21, 2000 at 10:00 am ALL primary pools 
will be under A Demand Mismatch Order.

Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for

250," Bill, presented below is a summary of the Midland EOTT tank compliance=20
status verified by fax and telephone with the teams.  This information is 9=
8%=20
complete until actual onsite verification occurs, which is set up for the=
=20
month of August. I plan on visiting each team and tank in the Midland=20
Region.  However, until the site visits are completed, this should give you=
 a=20
good idea of the status of the EOTT pipeline tanks stand with respect to ai=
r=20
compliance. =20

1. Tank compliance database, general.  The database, which included 366 tan=
ks=20
at the onset, has been reduced to 106 EOTT P/L tanks.  Tanks operated by EO=
TT=20
Trucking; non-EOTT tanks;  tanks sold, removed, duplicated, or otherwise=20
listed in error, were removed (and saved in another file).  Of the 106 tank=
s=20
listed, 80 are active, 12 are inactive, 10 are permanently out-of-service,=
=20
and 4 are abandoned in place.

=20
2. Permit issues.=20
Federal

a. Title V permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Electric pumps a=
re=20
the norm  at EOTT tank farms, so site emissions are exclusively from the=20
tanks and do not exceed 100 TPY.  (Only Crane Station has a Title V permit)=
. =20
This statement is based on =01&worst case=018 calculations using EPA TANKS =
4.0=20
which indicated that in a:

5,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  3.6 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 7=
20=20
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 48 tons (2 tpy breathing loss, 46 t=
py=20
working loss).=20

55,000 bbl EFR tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 255=20
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 9 tons (6 tpy breathing loss, 3 tpy=
=20
working loss).=20

55,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e.,=
=20
255 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 4 tons (1 tpy breathing loss, 3=
=20
tpy working loss).=20


State=20

b. State permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Sixty-three (63) o=
f=20
the 106 tanks were constructed before 1971 (and not modified or=20
reconstructed). These tanks are grandfathered and require no permit as long=
=20
as throughputs do not significantly change. =20

All of the EOTT Texas tanks of any size constructed/modified/reconstructed=
=20
after 1971 and equipped with a floating roof are exempt under Standard=20
Exemption 86, currently known as Permit-by-Rule 106.478.   None of the tank=
s=20
store material with a true vapor pressure above 11.0 psia, and total actual=
=20
VOC emissions authorized under exemption from any site does not exceed the =
30=20
TAC 106.4 limit of 25 tpy.   No registration for the exemption is necessary=
,=20
since the tanks are not located in a nonattainment county for ozone.

New Mexico=01,s permitting program for petroleum storage tanks is being=20
developed but,  currently, there are no requirements. Therefore, all EOTT=
=20
tanks in New Mexico meet state permit requirements.  However, when finalize=
d,=20
the control requirements for tanks in New Mexico will not be more stringent=
=20
than the federal NSPS Subpart Kb.  Therefore, a tank equipped with a floati=
ng=20
roof would be authorized to store petroleum product with a true vapor=20
pressure up to 11.0 psia.   Only the four fixed roof tanks at Maljamar and=
=20
the one at Loco Hills could be affected.=20

4. Recordkeeping and inspection issues.  The grandfathered tanks have no=20
requirements. For tanks subject to NSPS Subpart K, only capacity data is=20
required.  Tanks subject to Ka and Kb require inspection, repairs if=20
warranted, and recordkeeping. =20

Note: Especially for some of the older tanks, neither a manufacturer=01,s=
=20
identification plate or=20
strapping table is available.  I would suggest that we pursue a records=20
search of old EOTT files to verify construction dates.  I dont know where t=

266,"Dear Datek Online Customer,

The equity in your account has fallen below margin maintenance
requirements, creating a Margin Maintenance Call (or ""House Call"") as of
November 8, 2000.

Amount Due: The house call is for $ 1836

Date Due: This call is due by the close of business on Monday, November
13, which will be Day 3 of the house call.

Please be aware that Friday, November 10, 2000 is a bank holiday.  Banks
will not be open to wire transfer funds.  If you plan on funding your
account to meet your margin call, please wire funds to Datek Online
prior to Friday.  Once you have wired your funds remember to have your
bank provide you with a wire receipt containing a federal reference
number.

Datek Online only accepts a faxed copy of the wire receipt including the
federal reference number as proof of funds forthcoming.  Please fax your
wire receipt to 732-744-9143.

If you choose to overnight a check to Datek Online, please confirm with
the carrier that they will be delivering on Friday.  U.S. Post Offices
will not open and will not be delivering mail on Friday November 10,
2000.

The call requirements can be satisfied by:

1.  Depositing sufficient funds into your account to satisfy the entire
amount of the call.
2.  Selling sufficient securities in your account to satisfy the entire
amount of the call.
3.  The market value of your portfolio appreciating above equity
requirements.

What you should do:

A margin call requires you keep a watchful eye on the value of your
portfolio.  Be mindful of market fluctuations in your portfolio and how
they affect your account.  A margin call is payable on demand, and
rapidly depreciating market conditions may require immediate action
involving liquidation of sufficient securities in your account to
satisfy the call without further notice from us to you.  Taking the
necessary steps to satisfy the house call can avoid this.

This margin call must be satisfied by the close of the market on Monday,
November 13.  You should immediately decide which call payment method is
best for you.  Do not delay in satisfying the call.  Please take
immediate action to satisfy this call prior to the close of the market
on Monday, November 13, 2000-DAY 3. If your account does not meet margin
equity requirements as of the market open on November 14-DAY 4 we will
be forced to take action to satisfy the call by selling some or all of
your portfolio.

Sending Additional Funds to Meet Your Margin Call

The amount stated above is the amount of the call that may be met by
depositing additional funds (cash) into your account.   The fastest way
to deposit funds is to send a wire.

If you choose to wire funds you must:

1.   Fax a copy of the wire receipt
2.   Include the federal reference number of the wire
3.   Fax to 732-744-9143

Important Note
Datek Online only accepts a faxed copy of the wire receipt including the
federal reference number as proof of funds forthcoming.


If you choose to send a check by overnight mail you must:

1.   Include your UserName and account number on your check
2.   Mail to:
Datek Online
Attn: Cashiering Department - Margin Call
100 Wood Avenue South
Iselin, NJ 08830-2716

Important Notes:

? We do not accept an air bill number, a copy of a check or phone or
email confirmations as proof of funds forthcoming.
? We must receive and credit funds sent by overnight check by the close
of business on Day 3 for your margin call to be met.

<http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/deposits.html>

Liquidating Positions to Meet Your Margin Call

In order to liquidate enough stock to meet the initial amount of your
margin call you must do the following:

1.   Determine the margin requirement for the position you wish to
liquidate.   Stocks with special margin requirements can be found on our
HelpDesk under ""Your Portfolio"" and ""Margin Maintenance"" or by using the
following link:

http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/margin.html

2.   Divide the amount of the margin call by the margin requirement for
the position you wish to liquidate.  This is equal to the dollar amount
of the security you must sell to meet the initial amount of the margin
call.

Example:

The amount of the margin call is $1500.  To determine the dollar amount
of a security you must sell to meet this margin call divide $1500 by the
margin requirement for the stock you wish to liquidate.  If the margin
requirement is 30% (.30) you must sell $5000 worth of the
position.  If the margin requirement is 40% (.40) you must sell $3750
worth of the stock.

Your Call Could be Satisfied Through Market Fluctuation

Margin calls are calculated after the close of business on a daily basis
using the closing prices for each day.  In order for you to meet your
margin call through market fluctuation your account must close the
traditional trading day above the minimum margin maintenance
requirements.  This must be done by the close of November 13-Day 3 in
order for the call to end.  Intra-day market fluctuation will not
suffice in meeting your margin call.

Please do not assume your call will be satisfied because stocks in your
portfolio are ""bound to go up"". All stocks are subject to market
volatility. There are no guarantees that a stock price will rise or
assurances that a stock will not decline. Furthermore, your stocks could
decline further, creating an even larger margin call. Once again, do not
""bank"" on market fluctuation. Consider all factors, including your risk
tolerance, to take a realistic view of how to handle the margin call.


Account Equity and Additional House Calls

Depending on the securities you are holding in your portfolio and their
market fluctuations, additional funds may be due or actions that are
separate from this margin call may be required.  This may result in a
second house call.  The key is to understand the equity requirements and
ensure that your account is meeting them.  We may request additional
margin maintenance due to:

? A further decline in the market value of your positions.  At that time
you may meet a margin call only to be issued a second one because the
equity in the account has declined below a point where the initial
margin call no longer brings the account to the acceptable equity level.
In these instances, meeting the initial call may give you additional
time to meet the second call but the account must be returned to the
required equity ratio.
? Any undue concentration of one security in your account.

Needless to say, selling out an account is something we don't like to do
at Datek Online.  We want you to be aware of the status of your margin
account at all times, and be prepared to take action as soon as
conditions warrant.  Be fully aware that if at any time your account
value falls to approximately 10% equity, or if market conditions
warrant, we reserve the right to close out some or all of your positions
with or without notice, at our sole discretion.  You should review our
HelpDesk to check equity requirements.

The hardware that is replaced during overhauls is:
All Bearings (#1,#2,#3)
All seals #1 brg, IGV & variable stators, #2 brg, #3 brg, #1 
nozzle,              #2 nozzle, #3 nozzle
All hardware (nuts, bolts, washers for cases, housings etc.)
All gaskets and packings (air/oil tube, oil drain tubes etc)
All o-rings (oil inlet tubes, etc)

This applies to recoupes and standard engines.  The thing different on the 
recoupe is that some of the hardware for the cases is different and the 
internal blankets are replaced.

If you have any questions or if I can be of further service, please do not 
hesitate to give me a call.

280,"Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

At one point, we had mentioned the idea of having services agreements among 
Corp. and the various business units that are using shared services.  I think 
that these agreements should be put into place sooner rather than later as we 
begin to move towards shared services across the organization.

Let me know if you would like me to prepare the drafts of these agreements or 
revise agreements that currently are in existence (if there are none, then we 
really need to put some in place).

Michelle's dead on, and once whe pointed that out, it made sense to me.  

But, even so, the lower calculation portion under the Voluntary Separation header does not appear to include any sort of four weeks pay line (I wrongly thought that was what the 2 week pay line was referring to).  So, an employee looking at the info can't clearly see 4 weeks being added in (if it is being added in as set up right now, which I can't tell).   If it's not being added in, the Voluntary Separation Payment line will be wrong and look smaller than it should.  

Can we we set the lines after 2 week's pay to look the the math formula in the upper portion of the page?

		Sep. pay per service year
	+ 	Sep pay per 10k salary
	+	4 weeks base pay
	=	Total Vol. Sep payment

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.",Mark Breese Eric Moon Eric Boyt Santiago Garcia Melissa Solis Ed McMichael	,,ENA EES ECR Associates and Analysts

Business cards are a great way to share information about yourself and your company when you want to network with others such as clients, businesses, vendors, and so on.  But if you are communicating via email, what do you do? A handy solution is electronic business cards, called vCards (virtual business cards), which you can send and receive in e-mail using Outlook  Many other e-mail and personal information manager (PIM) applications can use vCards as well, not just Outlook. For more information on vCards, visit the Internet Mail Consortium at http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcardoverview.html
Note: vCards are not needed when communicating with fellow employees, since we already have access to the Outlook address book and Peoplefinder.

Attend the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring Conference: Power Markets 2002: Risk and Reward, April 17-18, 2002, at the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed. 

Come hear the experts who will help you survive and thrive in 2002! 

Topics 

Transmission and RTOs: Representatives from PJM, Cal ISO and Midwest ISO on their respective regions.

Credit: Susan Abbott of Moody's on evolving credit standards in our industry

Insurance: Scott Ettien from NCM, Lynda Clemmons from Element Re and Pat Toner Goudarzi from ACE, on Credit Insurance, Weather-risk Insurance and Innovative Insurance Products, respectively

Exchanges: Monte SImpson of InterContinental Exchange and Brad Leach of NYMEX on the growth in the use of exchanges.

Markets: Chris Pollatos of Mirant, Dave Freeman of Panda and Mike Young of Aquila on the state of various aspects of the power markets.

And More! Cabell Poindexter of Wyndham Mills on job prospects! John OBrien of Skipping Stone on the outlook for Transmission! Henwood on outlook for powerplant construction! Adrian Palmer of Caminus Corp on European Markets! 

Fundamentals of Power Marketing. On April 16, Scott Spiewak will be repeating his ""Fundamentals of Power Marketing"" preconference seminar. Essential for the new industry participant, it is also a valuable overview for the industry professional.

Here is my two cents...

From your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches 
overhang the condominium fence.  If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.  

The condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on
our property or destroy the tree.  

A landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is
obstructing a public road.   A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.  Since
the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a ""negligence"" issue.
Further, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm 
unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.  

If the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a ""nuisance"" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.  Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.

Bottom Line:  We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down.

311,"Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some 
steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  

1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities
	- They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so.
	- They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.

	We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South
	hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard
	will be checking everyones card prior to entry. 

	We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and
	IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the	South door.

	We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation
	Center (EB42C1). 

2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone 
	
	We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared 
	to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS. 
	
On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics
business functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, 
and workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to
support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured
for approximately two weeks, depending on events.

I just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.

The final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases:

1. By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.

2. With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.

Commissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.  Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.  The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.  

The discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.  The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct.  -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.",Massey,,GISB Commission NAESB ETS
326,"Galen/Jim,

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.


A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?

Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.

331,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=

351,"Hi Folks,

Breaking News for you and wanted to let you know:   Bob Berger and Bruce
Murray just reported on Sporting News Radio that Carolina RB Tshimanga
Biakabutuka is out 8 weeks with a broken foot.

Not naming a RB yet and it's pretty muddled there.   Richard Huntley and
Nick Goings had been running earlier this year but today, Brad Hoover was
the other RB to share time with Biakabutuka.   None of these guys get's
anyone too excited.

More as we hear it.

Joe

Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib.

entire article:  http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/915564.html

Vikings quarterback Todd Bouman, declaring that the injured thumb on 
his throwing hand is much better, said today he's ready to go Sunday 
against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

""I took all of the snaps today,'' said Bouman, who has moved up to 
startiang quarterback after Daunte Culpepper injured his knee. ""The 
thumb is a little sore, but I'll be ready to go on Sunday.""

Bouman continued: ""I've come a long way the last couple of days. With 
all of the treatment I have gotten, I can squeeze the ball and I can 
throw pretty much anything I want to throw, so I don't foresee it 
being a problem.""

The St. Cloud State product injured his thumb in the team's 27-24 
loss last Sunday to Detroit. 

Bouman has had limited practice action this week. Backup Spurgeon 
Wynn has taken more snaps the past few days, and the team brought in 
Ramaro Miller, cut in training camp, should he have been needed to 
back up Wynn.

Bouman today called dealing with the injury just ""part of the game. 
You've just got to come in and get treatment, and hopefully things 
will turn around fast. It's progressed each day, and that's all you 
can do.""

He said there's a risk that it could be re-injured Sunday. ""It's not 
going to heal until the season is over. So any time if you get hit on 
it, it's going to re-injure it or aggravate it. But you've just got 
to deal with it.""

Concerning Culpepper's surgery, Green said today that it ""went as 
expected ... and he has a positive prognosis. Daunte's rehabilitation 
will begin immediately.""

While there's be no definitive word on when Culpepper might return to 
the lineup, he could end up missing the season's remaining three 
games. The consequence of that appears minimal, considering the 
Vikings are virtually eliminated from a playoff berth.

****************************

Our View:  With Todd taking all the snaps on Thursday, he is a very 
safe bet to start on Sunday.  Culpepper is not expected to return 
this season so Todd should start the remainder of the season unless 
he is injured further.

382,"Utilities' Demand Blocks Bailout 
NEGOTIATIONS HIT SNAG: PG&E, Edison want end to price freeze if they sell 
transmission lines to state David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, March 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M
N114450.DTL 
California's near-bankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates 
be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines, The Chronicle has 
learned. 
A rate increase -- perhaps of more than 50 percent, according to earlier 
industry estimates -- would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from 
consumer groups and force Gov. Gray Davis to backtrack from earlier pledges 
that rates would remain unchanged. 
Nevertheless, sources close to negotiations on the deal said Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher 
rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell 
the state their transmission systems and some land. 
The sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials 
realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the Public 
Utilities Commission to pass along all of the utilities' costs to ratepayers. 
The sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from 
runaway wholesale electricity prices. 
The inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing 
complexity of a deal originally intended by Davis to stabilize the finances 
of PG&E and Edison so banks would resume loans to the cash-strapped 
utilities. 
The negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of 
the utilities' transmission networks and acquisition of utility-owned land, 
including spectacular coastal property near PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear 
power plant. 
Now they also have embraced further deregulation of California's 
dysfunctional electricity market. 
""Clearly, one of the terms being discussed is the regulatory environment,"" 
said Joseph Fichera, head of Saber Partners, a New York investment bank that 
is advising Davis in the talks. 
""The past situation has not worked well,"" he added. ""The utilities want some 
certainty about their future."" 
TENTATIVE DEAL WITH EDISON
To date, the governor has announced a tentative agreement with Edison for the 
state to buy the utility's power lines for almost $3 billion. Discussions 
with PG&E for a similar accord have dragged on for weeks. 
An Edison official, asking that his name be withheld, acknowledged yesterday 
that an end to the rate freeze is an expected result of the power- line sale. 
""Once the details of the pact are complete, dominoes will fall,"" the official 
said. ""One of the dominoes is the rate freeze."" 
A PG&E spokesman declined to comment. 
In fact, both Edison and PG&E have been aggressively seeking an end to the 
rate freeze for months. 
The two utilities have a lawsuit pending in federal court demanding that the 
PUC immediately raise rates so the utilities can recover almost $13 billion 
in debt accrued as a result of the freeze. 
""They have been trying a lot of things to get the rate freeze ended in 
various forms,"" said Carl Wood, who sits on the PUC. ""Adding it to the 
present talks is consistent with past behavior."" 
Wall Street has taken note that the negotiations no longer appear to be 
making progress. 
Paul Patterson, an energy industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, 
told clients on Monday that the discussions ""may have lost some momentum in 
recent days."" He did not give a reason. 
For his part, the governor sounded unusually cautious about the course of the 
talks when asked late last week if a breakthrough was imminent. 
SECRET STICKING POINTS
""We are going to take the transmission systems and the land that's deeded, 
and we will work out an agreement,"" Davis said at an appearance in San Jose. 
""But there are a number of sticking points in the talks with PG&E that I'm 
not going to reveal."" 
One of those sticking points apparently is an insistence that the sale of 
utility assets include a long-sought lifting of the rate freeze. 
Sources said lawyers from both PG&E and Edison had inserted the related terms 
into draft accords affecting each utility, and that the full impact of the 
additions was not realized by state officials until this week. 
One source said the language was just convoluted enough to slip beneath the 
radar screen of state negotiators. But the upshot, once the words had been 
parsed, was that the PUC effectively would lose control over power rates. 
CREDITWORTHINESS ON THE TABLE
In Edison's case, the terms of the tentative deal include the governor asking 
the PUC ""to support the creditworthiness"" of the utility. 
""This would ensure that future investments in both utility distribution and 
utility generation plants are provided fair returns of and on capital, 
consistent with current authorized returns and capital structure provisions,"" 
it says. 
Sources said the provision could be interpreted as a guarantee from the state 
that Edison would be permitted to recoup all outstanding costs from 
ratepayers. 
""There may be some assumptions about this language that the rate freeze ends 
if it is adopted,"" the Edison official said, adding that he saw no reason to 
disagree with such assumptions. 
But Fichera, Davis' adviser in the talks, insisted that nothing is set in 
stone, and that the negotiations are proceeding without a hitch. 
""This is a very complex transaction,"" he said. ""God and the devil are in the 
details.""

383,"Mike:  Here are my comments.  Apologies for the fact that they are quick and 
dirty.

All Enron's public statements that I have read, including, I think, 
statements made to financial analysts, state that our exposure in California 
is not ""material.""  Dennis' declaration says that the situation in California 
has been a ""financial disaster,"" that ""Enron has lost over $300 million,"" and 
that ""Enron stands to lose millions more.""  The losses are described as 
""huge.""  Perhaps this is information that has since been communicated to the 
market, but I'm not aware of it.  And if it hasn't, it could represent a 
significant conflict with previous statements.  Seems prudent to run this by 
IR and perhaps others before releasing.
Regarding the statements about our hedging strategy.  It would seem prudent 
to run this through the organization for comment and discussion prior to 
making public.
Very minor technical point--I don't think that AB 1890 was passed 
""unanimously.""  I think that there was 1 nay vote.
The statement is made that ""the utilities were required to sell off most of 
their generating capacity.""  The utilities were only required to sell off 1/2 
of their fossil-fired plants (which I think at the time may have amounted to 
about .2-.25 of their total gen assets).  They chose voluntarily to sell of 
the remainder of their fossil-fired plants.
It is stated that stranded costs are ""investments in imprudent power 
generation facilities.""  These investments were in fact found in the past to 
be prudent by the PUC.  Would therefore not seem accurate to call them 
imprudent now.
Is it now ""virtually impossible to manage commodity risk"" in California?  
Just wondering if judge might view the statement as overstating the situation 
somewhat.
From a PR perspective, I'm wondering if we want to characterize re-sourcing 
UC/CSU in the following manner, ""It was actually a relatively easy decision 
to make.""  Makes Enron sound perhaps excessively hard-nosed.

 Have you had a chance to consider the potential impacts of pending new
regulations on industrial powerplant facilities, what you might have to do
and what your alternatives may be?  The Boiler Maximum Achievable Control
Technology (MACT) Standards to be proposed this year; the Regional Haze
Standards that will begin to be implemented; the consideration of short
term SO2 standards again; and, the implementation process for the Fine
Particulate National Ambient Air Quality Standards (PM NAAQS) will all
impact existing sources, big and small. The permitting process for any new
or existing facility is demanding Best Available Control Technologies
(BACT) or Lowest Achievable Emission Rates (LAER) on almost all sources for
Particulate, Sulfur Dioxide, Mercury, Chlorine, and a host of other
emissions.  How will this impact your company and your job?

 If you are an industrial corporate environmental or energy engineer or
manager with the responsibility to make sure there is sufficient energy to
run the company and comply with environmental regulations, you should be
represented at this conference.  If you are an Architect/Engineer or
energy/environmental consulting firm, you should be represented. If you are
an equipment supplier with interest in the industrial market place, you
should be represented.  And, if you are a state regulator with interest in
what can actually be accomplished in the industrial sector, you should be
represented.  CIBO conferences have been noted for bringing the full range
of stakeholders together for practical discussions and education on energy
and environmental issues to promote progress on environmental issues and
secure a competitive and strong energy future for the United States.

 The time is now for the consideration of what will be required over the
next two to ten years.  What you learn from attending this conference could
save you countless hours of frustration, provide a foundation for current
and future planning and open a host of alternatives not before considered.

Energy Efficiency Funding Protected in PG&E Bankruptcy Case
Public Purpose Programs Essential to Help Keep the Lights on, Says NRDC

SAN FRANCISCO (May 16, 2001) - A judge in San Francisco federal court
today ruled that approximately $260 million that had been tied up in the
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) bankruptcy proceedings will be
released to fund California energy efficiency programs. These funds come
from a small surcharge on utility customers' monthly bills and provide
desperately needed electricity savings that will help protect the
reliability of the state's overstressed power grid, said NRDC (Natural
Resources Defense Council).

""This is a victory for California consumers and the environment,"" said
Peter Miller, NRDC senior scientist. ""NRDC worked very hard to ensure
that the state would make these important energy efficiency investments
in the first place.""

In a ruling from the bench this morning, Judge Dennis Montali of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco ruled in favor of a motion by
PG&E for authority to honor its obligations for public purpose programs.
NRDC, Environmental Defense and Utility Consumers' Action Network filed
a memo with the court in support of the utility's argument that it is
merely a conduit for the public purpose funds and that the funds should
be off limits to the utility's creditors. ""PG&E is to be commended for
strenuous efforts here in a very good cause,"" said Ralph Cavanagh, NRDC
energy program director.

California has aggressively promoted energy efficiency in buildings and
equipment since the 1970s, reducing total peak electricity needs by
about one-fifth or 10,000 megawatts (MW). Approximately half of those
reductions have come from public purpose programs funded by a small
surcharge on bills paid by customers of PG&E, Southern California
Edison, and San Diego Gas & Light. Since 1998 alone, these programs have
delivered about 500 MW of electricity savings.

""At a time when the difference between an intact grid and rolling
blackouts is sometimes measured in the tens of megawatts, energy
efficiency clearly represents the fastest, cheapest and cleanest
solution to California's electricity dilemma,"" said Miller.

The public purpose programs provide financial incentives to businesses
and consumers to design more energy efficient buildings and to buy
energy efficient equipment, such as refrigerators, air conditioners,
light bulbs and clothes washers. They also provide funding for
investments in renewable energy, low-income energy services, and
long-term research and development for clean energy technologies.

The Natural Resources Defense Council is a national, non-profit
organization of scientists, lawyers and environmental specialists
dedicated to protecting public health and the environment. Founded in
1970, NRDC has more than 400,000 members nationwide, served from offices
in New York, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco. More information

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India state panel head to resume Enron talks.

05/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, May 23 (Reuters) - India's Maharashtra state averted a crisis on 
Wednesday when it persuaded the head of a panel renegotiating U.S. energy 
giant Enron's troubled Dabhol power project to remain in his job. 
Madhav Godbole, who quit earlier on Wednesday, said he was returning after 
the state cabinet unanimously rejected his offer to resign.
""They have bestowed confidence in me,"" he told Reuters. 
Godbole's resignation over remarks made against him by a senior politician 
had created a stir and looked likely to derail efforts to resolve a raging 
row between Houston-based Enron Corp. and the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB). 
Enron's $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra is widely 
seen as a test case for India's plans to privatise its power sector. 
Godbole was heading a committee to renegotiate the contract between Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC), owned 65 percent by Enron, and state utility Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB), which has been embroiled in dispute for over 
six months. 
The dispute was sparked off last month when MSEB began defaulting on monthly 
payments to DPC, which is building the 2,184 megawatts power plant in the 
state. 
The first phase of 740 MW of the project is already up and running, while the 
second phase of 1,444 MW is slated to be completed next month. 
After months of wrangling over a payments dispute with the cash-strapped 
state electricity board, DPC last Saturday issued a preliminary notice to 
terminate its contract to sell power to the utility. 
Dabhol's termination notice was widely seen as a first step by Enron to pull 
out of the power project. 
MSEB is planning to retaliate by imposing a fine of four billion rupees 
($85.16 million) on the power firm. 
Godhole was appointed last month to resolve this dispute. 
The next meeting of the committee, which was due to meet with DPC officials 
on Wednesday, may be held next Tuesday, he said. 
Meanwhile, a senior banker told Reuters that local lenders to DPC were 
planning to seek the help of the federal government in ensuring that foreign 
lenders did not invoke guarantees that they have issued. 
The Business Standard newspaper said the losses of the local lenders would 
amount to nearly 30 billion rupees if the guarantees were invoked. ($1=46.97 
Indian rupees).

Dutch NMa To Decide On Import Capacity Complaints By Sept

05/23/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

AMSTERDAM -(Dow Jones)- Dutch competition authority NMa doesn't expect to 
reach a decision on complaints filed by several large market parties on the 
way cross-border electricity transportation capacity is allocated before the 
end of August, a commission on the subject said Wednesday during a hearing. 
The commission needs to hear the response to these complaints from Sep, or 
Nea, as the umbrella association for Dutch electricity generators is now 
called, before it can make a decision on the matter.
A representative of Nea said the organization couldn't respond on Wednesday 
as it ""needs more time to prepare."" 
Several large parties in the Dutch energy market Wednesday appeared before 
the commission to elaborate on previously submitted complaints on the way 
cross-border electricity transport capacity is currently allocated. 
The complaints heard by the commission showed grave concerns that existing 
mechanisms are driving up electricity prices and hampering the development of 
a free market instead of fostering it, as the Dutch government had aimed to 
do. 
At the hearing in The Hague, Cecile Gommans of the antitrust regulator NMa, 
who heads the committee on the subject, said complaints focus on the 
privileged position Nea members have in the allocation of import capacity and 
the rules for the auctions through which the remaining capacity is 
distributed in the markets. 
Three out of the four Nea members are owned by German and Belgian companies 
who control the interconnectors on the other side of the Dutch border. As 
such, half of the proceeds from such auctions accrue to the parent companies 
of the Nea members. 
Of the 3,900 megawatts of total import capacity available, over 900 MW are 
reserved for Nea. Other participants for whom the capacity available to them 
is therefore limited feel the market mechanism has failed to deliver access 
to imported power on equal terms. 
The complaints on the way auctions of import capacity are conducted are 
mostly on entering conditions for parties who want to bid. Smaller parties 
feel rigid rules for that are practically excluding them from the auctions. 
The capacity auctions are held by the TenneT Auction Office, a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Dutch grid operator TenneT. 
The complaints submitted NMa include those from Enron Corp. (ENE), Dutch 
energy intensive consumer group VEMW and Dutch chemicals industry association 
VNCI. 
After Nea's response, which is scheduled for mid-June, the NMa expects to 
decide on the complaints ""within 10 weeks"", Gommans said.

Enron's secret bid to save deregulation/PRIVATE MEETING: Chairman pitches his 
plan to prominent Californians
Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers


   Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly
courted Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other
luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution
to California's energy crisis.
   His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and
federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.
   Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign
contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at
the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.
   Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham
Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in
1990 and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star
Schwarzenegger;
   and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have
been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.
   One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be
identified, said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting
participants to support Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who
are trying to solve the state's energy mess.
   PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION
   The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is
concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with
power markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government
authority to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last
week to create and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and
run power plants in California.
   ""They're trying to rescue deregulation,"" the source said of Enron
executives. ""They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea.""
   At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position
paper titled ""Comprehensive Solution for California,"" which was obtained
by The Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the
billions in debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that
investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are
making matters worse.
   The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway
electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power
generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by
regulators and economists.
   One of the talking points read: ""Get deregulation right this time --
California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers.""
Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving
electricity.
   INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS
   Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and
was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment
with a competitive power market system.
   Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially
produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from
generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this
year, Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.
   Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for
Enron, said she would ""look into that"" and then did not return repeated
telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at
the meeting.
   D.C. CONNECTIONS
   Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached
unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times,
Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs
regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story
also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not
support Lay's desire to further deregulate the nation's electricity
system. Lay denied the allegation.
   Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief
executive of home builder Kaufman & Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of
Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant
Amgen.
   Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles
Lakers star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton
supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's
first civilian space trip.
   Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but
declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for
comment through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday
afternoon.
   A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor
attended,
   but was ""not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this
issue.
   His intent is to listen to all sides.""
   Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to
Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support
Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source
who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal
and asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his
agenda.

USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E opens bids to add 1.2 bcf of natgas in Calif.

05/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 30 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co., in an effort to 
determine interest in expanding its California natural gas pipeline system, 
said it was accepting bids for up to 1.2 billion cubic feet a day (bcfd) of 
gas transport capacity. 
The move by the company, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , 
responds to California's growing demand for natural gas to run new power 
plants.
Gas suppliers and big industrial customers participating in the bidding 
round, called an open season, have until July 31 to submit offers stating how 
much pipeline capacity they are willing to purchase and the price they are 
willing to pay. 
Based on the results of this round, PG&E will decide whether to proceed with 
the planned 1.2 bcf expansion - enough to run seven 1,000 megawatt gas-fired 
power plants - or modify it to accommodate an even bigger volume of gas. 
As it stands, PG&E's open season is offering firm capacity on its its 
Redwood, Baja, and Silverado pipelines. 
These lines transport gas from Malin, Oregon; Topock, Arizona, and California 
gas production to the company's local transmission system and other 
pipelines. 
PG&E's current intrastate pipeline system can transport more than 3 bcf of 
gas a day throughout Northern and Central California. 
Over the past year, utilization rates on many California pipelines have

US FERC Plans Technical Conference On RTO 'Seams' Issue

05/30/2001

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will 
hold a technical conference in June or July on the coordination of wholesale 
power transactions among regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, FERC 
Chairman Curt Hebert announced Wednesday. 
FERC is in the midst of implementing a sweeping order that directs the 
utilities it regulates to turn over their transmission assets to independent 
control by RTOs, which are slated to begin operating at the end of this year.
The order aims to promote more liquid regional wholesale power markets by 
creating independent power-grid operators, removing the remaining ability of 
vertically integrated utilities to use control of transmission to competitive 
benefit in power markets. 
In December, competitive power suppliers and industrial consumers petitioned 
the commission to convene a technical conference on what was termed the 
""seams"" issue involving wholesale power transactions from one 
RTO-administered grid area to another. 
Unless the ""seams"" issue is addressed, ""RTOs could soon resemble huge speed 
bumps which could not just slow down, but do permanent harm to the vehicle of 
competition,"" the petitioners warned. 
Addressing the ""seams"" issue is ""absolutely crucial to the RTO process,"" 
Hebert said Wednesday, expressing the hope that the conference can be 
scheduled before July and allow FERC to ""figure out the right way to do it."" 
The groups that petitioned for the technical conference welcomed the decision 
to hold the technical conference. 
""It's overdue, but we appreciate the fact that it's coming about,"" said John 
Hughes, technical director at the Electricity Consumers Resource Council. 
ELCON represents large industrial electricity users. 
""Looking at the seams issues and addressing the seams issues successfully 
will address an awful lot of problems we see in terms of balkanized, 
dysfunctional markets,"" Hughes said. 
ELCON was joined in the petition by Enron Power Marketing Inc. (ENE), Reliant 
Energy Power Generation (REI) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN), and the Electric Power 
Supply Association. 
EPSA, which represents competitive power producers and marketers, is 
""thrilled"" that FERC will address the issue, said spokesman Mark Stultz. 
Addressing the seams issue is ""critical with regard to allowing RTOs to 
function and to enhance the movement of electricity across the country,"" 
Stultz said. 
""If you're moving toward a national grid, as the administration has proposed 
in its national energy policy, you want to make sure you don't have 
disconnects at the seams of these RTOs,"" he said. 
""The more standardized the business practices for the grid the better,"" said 
Stultz. 
In March, the commission sought comment on whether to hold the technical 
conference. At the time, Commissioner William Massey welcomed the move, 
noting that the lack of standardized procedures could pose ""an impediment to 
trade."" 
Massey called for FERC to shepherd an industrywide effort to develop 
consistent standards for information and terminology regarding scheduling and 
reservation of transmission capacity among RTOs - including the development 
of ""generic interface procedures."" 
FERC spurred a similar standardization process in the natural gas industry, 
which resulted in creation of a Gas Industry Standards Board, or GISB. 
GISB produced uniform communications protocols for reserving pipeline 
capacity and standardized business practices, Massey noted, expressing the 
desire for the electric industry to do the same. By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

446,"Below are details of new plan currently being created by California State 
Treasurer Phil Angelides and supported by Sen. Burton.  The plan is in the 
initial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast-track.  It is 
also not motivated by a desire to save SoCal from bankruptcy.  The creator's 
goal is to give Californians more control over their energy and electric 
futures as well as giving the tax/rate payers a share of the pie in return 
for money that has/will go to the utilities.  We will continue to monitor 
this plan, its supporters and progress.

Plan Z
  California State Treasurer Phil Angelides and a powerful group of 
legislators are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve 
California's energy crisis this summer.  The group is comprised of leftish 
legislators, environmental advocates, in-state energy company executives and 
business leaders and they are pulling together a Plan Z.  At the core of the 
plan is the recently passed authorization to erect a California Public Power 
Authority that issues bonds, constructs new power plants and buys up 
transmission lines.  There is even talk within this group of using newly 
legislated authority to buy SoCal Edison for $3.5 billion (less than it owes) 
although they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from 
power companies as well as Edison itself.
  The five-year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarantee 
a 5%-15% ""cushion"" against energy peak demand.  Angelides and Burton want to 
create enough capacity to form a buyer's market.  One of the points of the 
plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector 
generation.  This plan may short-circuit private sector plans to build new 
plants, but the state has the ability to issue $5B in revenue-backed bonds 
(in addition to the $12B rate-backed bonds).    The second key element in the 
Angelides-Burton Plan Z is additional rate hikes for California's consumers 
and businesses.  Although discussions are still underway between this group 
and business leaders, Angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45% 
increase in residential and commercial electricity rates, however, there is 
immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on 
businesses.   This increase is on top of the 50%-60% already mandated by 
previous PUC decisions this year.  These rate increases will do two things: 
stop the immediate fiscal drain on the state of California and prevent 
emergency tax hikes (being serious considered last week).  
  Issues to consider in regards to this plan are: (1) how much will current 
shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long-owed 
debts (or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of SoCal 
Edison); and (2) how much will creditors have to ""eat"" in the legislated 
repayment plan?   In other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts 
be?  There is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to 
cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive 
and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year.",Phil Angelides Burton Angelides 50%-60,$3.5 billion 5B,SoCal SoCal Edison Edison Angelides-Burton Plan Z PUC

Summary:
1. IPPs Fall 4.0%   Last week our IPP composite fell 4.0%, underperforming
both the NASDAQ (+2.4%) and the S&P 500 (-1.1%).  Reflecting strong first
quarter earnings results, International Power was the best performer in the
group, rising 3.4%.  Calpine was the weakest performer, declining 10.3%.

2. New Issuance, Soft Power Prices and Political Questions Dampen Price
Performance   In our view, the group's recent lackluster stock price
performance reflects the following: 1) Pressure Resulting from Equity New
Issuance Activity; 2) Concern Over ""Soft"" Spot and Forward Power Prices;
and, 3) Lingering Uncertainty Surrounding the Power Shift in the US Senate.

3. Outlook Unchanged; Time to Focus on Valuation!   Despite the various
political and power market concerns, we believe the fundamental investment
outlook for the group remains strong.  While fixating on the various
political and power market concerns, we believe the market has not focused
enough on increasingly attractive current valuations.  We believe the
uncertainties surrounding re-regulation and political backlash are already
embedded in the stock prices.  While the pure play US IPP share prices have
increased 3.1% on average, our 2001 and 2002 EPS estimates have increased
nearly 25% and 24%.  Consequently, over the period the average P/E multiple
has declined by 17% and 20%, based on 2001 and 2002 EPS, respectively.
4. Embedded Expectations are Low   We draw 2 conclusions from the  above
data: 1. Stock prices reflect normalized power market conditions  2.
Re-regulation and backlash uncertainty are already reflected in stock
prices.
5. WSJ Article Questions CPN's Lack of Reserves   On June 1, 2001, an
article appeared in the Wall Street Journal highlighting the fact that CPN
has not taken reserves against nearly $267 million of receivables from PG&E.
In our view, CPN's rationale for not reserving against its PG&E receivables
is valid.  Versus the other major IPPs, CPN's PG&E exposure is unique in
that all of its current receivables have resulted from direct power sales to
PG&E under long-term contracts.  Regardless, it is important to put this
issue into perspective.  Even assuming a worst case scenario under which CPN
is unable to recover any of its PG&E receivables (highly unlikely), the
investment merits of the CPN story would be unaffected.  Failure to recover
would have no impact on CPN's future earnings power or growth rate.

? SoCal. Ed MOU Introduced as Bill
? House Committee Douses Emergency Energy Relief Act

MOU Has Its Day
Sources report that California Senator Polanco has introduced the legislation 
today for the MOU between the Governor and SoCal Edison (SB 78XX).  As 
reported earlier, sources still believe that there is not sufficient 
legislative support for this measure to pass.  Senator Polanco's political 
career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his 
MOU sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain 
support from Davis.  Additionally, the CPUC has added two necessary MOU 
provisions to its next week voting agenda, though support for these issues 
remains weak on the CPUC board.   

House Energy Relief Efforts
The House Energy and Commerce Committee gave up plans to ease California's 
energy woes because Republicans and Democrats could not settle a long 
standing debate over price caps in the West.  Representative Waxman admitted 
a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates, and 
several delayed mark-up sessions for the bill.  Barton noted the bill had 
little chance of aid California considering the time it would take to pass 
the bill would be longer than the California summer.

such a good product.  I would suggest only the following additions:  I would 
mention that the Commission should also require simplified interconnections 
and encourage faster certification of generation.  You simply touch on 
hedging, I would explain why, given that they had the  opportunity, it would 
have been prudent (with a simple example like how going to the spot market 
and then asking for a price cap is like day trading your retirement and then 
asking for legislation requiring a minimum price or something like that).  I 
really like the gas industry discussion.  Seabron, can you verify the 20

PRICE CAP BACKLASH. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted 
""fast-track"" processing to review the complaint filed by Morgan Stanley 
Capital Group to overturn the $500-per-megawatt-hour price cap imposed in 
late June by the California Independent System Operator (but see below), but 
saw no need to force the ISO to rescind the cap. 
As the FERC explained, a cap sets the price at which the ISO will buy power, 
and does not restrict options for sellers, as they can choose to sell into 
other markets. 
Commissioner Hebert concurred in the result, but called on the FERC to 
investigate the ISO. ""Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, 
requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the 
operator of the California grid."" Docket No. EL00-91 -000, 92 FERC 
(para)61,112, July 28, 2000. 
Earlier, on July 26, the FERC had asked its staff to conduct an investigation 
of price volatility in wholesale U.S. power markets, and to report back by 
Nov. 1, so that the commission could use the findings in evaluating proposals 
due from utilities by Oct. 15, regarding FERC Order 2000 and plans for 
regional transmission organizations. 
CALIFORNIA. On Aug. 1 the board of governors of the California Independent 
System Operator voted 15-6 (two abstained) to lower the price cap from $500 
per megawatt-hour to $250, effective from Aug. 7 to Oct. 15, in the real-time 
markets that it administers for ancillary services and congestion relief. 
NORTHEAST REGION. In separate orders, the FERC imposed temporary caps of 
$1,000 per megawatt-hour (the same level as PJM's price cap) governing bids 
by power suppliers in energy markets run by the New York Independent System 
Operator and the New England Power Pool 
But the caps did not escape a dissenting opinion from commissioner Curt 
Hebert, who accused the majority of rushing in to cover ""utility mistakes"" 
that created exposed positions in the market. Hebert likened the majority's 
concern over using emergency measures to Captain Louis Renault, the gendarme 
in the film ""Casablanca"" who was shocked to find gambling inside Rick's bar. 
Hebert repeated Casey Stengel's lament: ""Can't anyone here play this game?"" 
* NEW YORK ISO. In New York, the FERC cited a lack of demand-side 
participation. ""If load cannot respond to dramatic increases in prices,"" said 
the FERC, ""then generators can submit very high bids that the ISO must accept 
when supply is tight"" 
Nevertheless, the majority declined to include ""antigaming"" tariff rules 
requested by the New York state commission and various intervenors. Such 
rules would have placed a $24,000-per-megawatt limit on payments to suppliers 
over 24 hours, to prevent suppliers from attaching conditions to their bids 
requiring high minimum general levels or long minimum run times, as a way of 
evading the bid cap. Further, the bid cap will not apply to ancillary 
services, emergency imports into the region, or to so-called ""sink price 
bids,"" which set the scheduling queue for exports out of the ISO area, since 
such bids do not affect prices paid by New York buyers. 
The ISO board had sought the cap (set to expire on Oct. 28), but had 
suggested a higher bid maximum of $1,300-- approximately equal to the highest 
observed day-ahead locational marginal price seen within the ISO, at least as 
of the end of June. 
The FERC acknowledged that power supplies were tight, but predicted that the 
cap would not dry up imports from other regions since the New York ISO still 
maintained an installed capacity requirement. It said the weak demand-side 
volume was due, ""at least in part, to factors that prevent retail customers 
from seeing the realtime hour price, rather than because [they] are 
inherently willing to buy electricity at any price"" Docket No. ER003038-000, 
92 FERC (para)61,073, July 26, 2000. 
* NEW ENGLAND. The call for bid caps had come from Nstar (holding company for 
Boston Edison), which had also asked for a study of market power and had 
cited a general failure of market mechanisms and a resulting lack of 
confidence by market participants. The ISO itself had opposed bid caps. 
In imposing the cap, the FERC agreed that the New England power market did 
not operate in a competitive manner ""New England's existing market rules make 
it profitable for generators to submit very high bids for a small portion of 
their capacity ... When OP4 [emergency] conditions are declared ... 
generators know that virtually all bids will be accepted"" 
The FERC observed that New England's ""clearing-- price"" form of auction was 
designed to encourage bidding at cost, but that the region's ""actual 
experience"" had not been ""fully consistent with these bidding expectations"" 
It added, ""[PI rites in New England are vulnerable to spikes during OP4 
conditions that are vastly in excess of prices at other times."" Docket No.

481,"The FERC order appears to be putting a significant crimp on the  real time 
(R/T) desk of Enron and other marketers whenever market prices are at or near 
the cap.  The initial west wide cap is approx $108 an we hit that today in 
R/T. Briefly:

Marketers cannot sell above the cap.  So when prices reach the cap, 
generators are on their own to find buyers. (Generators can sell above the 
cap; if the generator is thermal they simply make a end-of-month cost 
filing.)  Marketers which provide an important function of making the market 
and providing transmission are simply shut out.

Even if a marketer makes a deal below the cap, the deal could be cut due to 
transmission problems.  Should the cost of replacement power exceed the cap 
(which can easily happen), the marketer may be left holding the bag because, 
again, the marketer cannot sell above the cap. 

When CAISO declares an emergency, the cap will change hourly.  R/T deals are 
usually done several hours out.   A marketer will essentially have no idea 
what the relevant cap will be when it is making its deal.

Cash markets can also face all these same problems.  However, the cash desks 
may be able to sell more than 24 hours out. 

Because these impacts are disproportionate on marketers, we should consider 
an appeal of this order separate from EPSA.

The Honorable Joseph Dunn
Chair, Senate Select Committee
California State Senate
Room 2080
California State Capitol
Sacramento, CA 95814

Dear Senator Dunn:

Earlier this year, you met individually with IEP and various other parties to 
explain the purpose of the Senate Select Committee?s hearing and the process 
under which they were to be conducted. ?You made it very clear that you were 
planning to have fact-finding hearings based upon fundamental fairness and 
due process. ?You made a further commitment that there would be no surprises. 
?Prior to today, the hearings have been conducted consistent with that 
representation.

Unfortunately, today it appears that the Committee has set a new course that 
radically departs from these previous commitments. ?Today, the Committee is 
hearing testimony from several surprise witnesses. ?These witnesses are 
former employees of San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) under contract with 
Duke Energy for an interim period during which Duke Energy operated the 
facilities in San Diego. ??It is our understanding that these former contract 
employees are alleging that the company failed to properly maintain these 
facilities, and they are alleging that Duke Energy cycled these facilities 
differently than the former owner, SDG&E. ?It is also our understanding that 
Duke Energy will not be afforded the opportunity to contemporaneously 
challenge these allegations and/or provide an explanation as to the 
operational behavior of the facilities. ?In short, the hearings are being 
reduced to a media event, giving credence to the unsustainable allegations of 
disgruntled ex-employees.

Respectfully, it would appear that the Committee has wandered far afield of 
its stated goals. ?These hearings have the potential of identifying what went 
wrong with California?s energy policy and how to fix it. ?However, this will 
only occur if this inquiry is based on informal facts and complete 
information, not innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations. ?It is the pursuit 
of facts, not headlines, which will solve California?s energy crisis. ?These 
facts will be revealed only in a fair process, where allegations made are 
subject to contemporaneous response. ?

It is our hope that today?s process is an aberration, and not a departure 
from your commitments. ?The Committee is at a crossroads. ?It can choose to 
engage in fact-finding and analysis, or it can be reduced to a witch-hunt in 
pursuit of headlines. ?For the benefit of all Californian?s, the Committee 
should focus on fact-finding and analysis.

Sincerely,

486,"On 6/20/01, I attended a Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
hearing regarding stationary internal combustion engines (including Diesel
Standby Generators).

The proposed regulation was ""framed"" in the following context:
BAAQMD is the only district in CA not now requiring permits for standby
engines 3-5k units are estimated in Bay Area, Avg. 350hp

While the previous hearings (5/11) had promised the final draft by 5/20/01,
the newest revisions were posted on Tuesday (6/19).  Evidently there were
last minute changes and a conclusion that the appropriate California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) document needs changes.  They may have
another workshop, possibly before the August 1st meeting, although it wasn't
clear if they can get the proper notices and input prior to that time.

The item was continued - Possible Final Action To Be Taken on August 1,
2001, although it may be continued again.

They can be fount at:   http://www.baaqmd.gov/ruledev/reg-pmt/r0201ph1.htm

MY CONCLUSIONS AND QUESTIONS/CONCERNS THAT REMAIN
* It is doubtful that any rule change would be approved in time to provide
relief for this summer (2001).
* We remain under the old rule exemption for fixed standby generators that
has a limit of 200 hours per year emergency runtime and 100 hours testing
maximum.
* In Regulation 2, Rule 1 - 114.2 - 2.3 states exemption for ""Portable
internal combustion engines and standby internal combustion engines which
are at a location for less than 72 consecutive hours"".  Does this mean the
previous guideline of BAAQMD not regulating mobile sources unless in place a
year is now just 72 hours?

I am reviewing the proposed changes further and plan to participate in
future workshops and the hearing on August 1, 2001.

07/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) 
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine 
Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the 
bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million 
for power already sold.
Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the 
announcement. 
As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that 
the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under 
the contracts, will be elevated to ""administrative priority status,"" a claim 
which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. 
Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed 
reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, 
Calpine said. 
The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy 
crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state 
with a series of rolling blackouts. 
Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual 
capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next 
five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's 
power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent 
more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated 
from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. 
""Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to 
ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these 
affordable and reliable energy resources,"" Calpine senior vice president 
James Macias said in a statement.

Goodin McBride to look into the issue of what, if anything, the CPUC can do 
in lieu of suspending direct access.

ABX 1 says the CPUC ""shall suspend"" DA, but does not give any time line for 
doing so, nor any criterita to use in making the determination to suspend 
it.  This gives the CPUC ample ability to delay suspending DA, especially 
while bills affecting DA are in play in Sacramento. The President could have 
her own investigation or propose her own solutions -- all the while delaying 
the suspension.  Brian also thought she could possibly put her own DA plan in 
place -- although he said it was a ""stretch.""  Brian said she could, for 
example, argue that limiting DA to the net short position was a way of 
implementing ABX 1.  He felt that adding an exit fee as well was , however, 
stretching the concept a bit too far.  Nonethless, limiting DA to a net short 
position could be argued to be within her existing authority under the law. 
She could also institute an ""open season"" through some defined date, such as 
Jan 1, 2002, and suspend DA thereafter.

She could take this action subject to the passage of superceding legislation 
-- which, of course, could either kill DA altogether or implement some 
combination of exit fee/DAopen season/DA limitation.

499,"The inequities that I am referring to are:

SDG&E is charging a CTC charge to recover $115 million in CTCs for 2001 and 
$115 million for 2002; wheras, their expectation is that there will be no 
stranded costs in those years for SONGS and QF/PPs.  SDG&E plans to use these 
overcollections to offset the undercollections from their cap for the subset 
of small customers.
SDG&E has filed at FERC to apply RMR overcollections recovered from all 
customers to the undercollections from their cap for the subset of small 
customers.
SDG&E is applying the stranded benefits from SONGS and QF/PPs for which all 
customers have paid for the stranded costs in the past to the 
undercollections from their cap for the subset of small customers.

This is not necessarily a DA versus SO customers, since small DA and SO 
customers are treated the same.  It is more of a subsidy issue between large 
and small customers.  However, since most DA customers are large customers, 
it becomes a DA and SO issue.

I don't believe SDG&E is hiding this fact, because they filed an application 
at the CPUC on October 24, 2000, illuminating this issue.

We also need to keep our eyes open to spot any other transfer of 
overcollections that should rightfully be used to reduce rates for all 
customers.  What is motivating SDG&E is their perceived shareholder risks 
with respect to the undercollections caused by the cap.  They want to reduce 
their exposure.

We need to be sensitive to our TURN friends, but we want to illuminate the 
shortcomings of this type of transition mechanism to prevent legislators and 
regulators from switching to this mechanism in the shortrun.

in addition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state, price caps, 
and the uncertainty surrounding them, chase new generation away.  The turbine 
market is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their 
own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in

515,"Dirk--

I would really appreciate it if you would not send any more correspondence re 
chronology to CSUF or anyone else outside of Enron without Legal and P&GA 
signoff.  Regardless of our relationship with CSUF, there is no such thing as 
""draft"" correspondence outside of Enron.  Everything that is sent outside the 
company, and most correspondence within the company, is discoverable in 
litigation, whether it has been blessed or not.  I am especially concerned 
about that statement that Enron intends to escalate this matter within Enron, 
PG&E and/or the CPUC, since with Project Mercury going on we may have 
strategic reasons not to discuss this project with PG&E or the CPUC that 
override our interest in CSUF.  In addition, I am concerned that if PG&E gets 
a hold of this correspondence, it may be used against us in the future as a 
means to twist our chronology around.  I also need to get clear verification 
of the chronology and breakdown of costs so that we can be sure that we 
present our story in the best possible light.

Again, please do not send any more correspondence to CSUF regarding this 
project, and especially regarding Enron's future actions with regard to this 
project, without clearing it beforehand with Legal and Gov't Affairs, whether 
""draft"" or otherwise.  In addition, we will need to send CSUF an email either 
""retracting"" the correspondence you just sent or stating that CSUF must not 
rely on the correspondence until we have verified all of the facts 
surrounding our view of the project.  I will assist you in drafting this 
email to CSUF.

Thanks for helping keep this under control until we have all of the 
stakeholders, including our betters in Houston, fully apprised of the 
situation.

Pls call or email if you would like to discuss further.

Dow Jones Electricity Indexes, specifically their NP15/SP15 indexes.
- the indexes are based on weighted average prices and total volumes
- they measure ""bilateral one-day prescheduled, financially firm transactions""

- Dow Jones has the right to randomly audit the data providers

why not the ex-post ISO?
- generators are not selling to California's ISO because of the $150/MWh 
price cap,
=> therefore prices coming out of the ISO do not reflect real market prices
- if generators are not selling into the market, there is no liquidity, 
therefore prices are not reflective of the prices that buyers must pay

why not use the ex-post ISO price on an interim basis?

541,"Here is the explaination on ""exit fees"" for direct access under SB 27X.

All parties, including the ESPs and large customers, agree that any party
who takes power from DWR after Jan 17, 2001, has received a subsidy as a
result of the operation of the frozen rates still in effect ( plus the
emergency penny/kWh surchage).  These customers will have to pay this
subsidy back in the form of retiring the revenue bonds which will be floated
to pay off the DWR power purchase costs.  If a customer were to elect direct
access during the bond repayment period (or anytime after 1-17-01), they
could potentially escape their fair share of the these costs, and would have
received the subsidized, lower cost electricity without paying the full cost
of that power.  To prevent this, the draft of SB 27X proposed by the direct
access coalition says that all customers electing direct access will be
responsible for any undercollection for DWR power costs related to the time
when they were served by DWR, until the date they stopped taking such
service, after which they have no more obligation to pay for DWR purchases.
This is subsection (d) of the coalition draft.

The second form of exit fee is that related to the actual DWR contracts for
power.  It is this charge (to make DWR whole for higher contract costs when
load leaves stranded capacity under contracts of a year or longer) which
will be waived during the period of ""open enrollment"" or ""free switching"" to
direct access.  There will be no exit fee during an initial open enrollment
period (date to be determined, we are asking for 10-1-01) and during all
times when the total long term generation portfolio assembled by DWR and the
utilities: retained generation, QF contracts, and long term (>1 yr.) DWR
purchases is less than the total load on the utility system, including load
growth.  Then customers can switch to direct access without this second exit
fee until the total load is reduced to match the long term portfolio. All
switches are first-come, first-served.

Once that equilibrium is reached any additional customers who want to elect
direct access may do so, but have to pay a fee equal to the net unmitigated
cost incurred by DWR as a result of losing that customer's load.  Once DWR
contracts expire, creating more ""headroom"" then customers can once again
switch without an exit fee.

I hope this clarifies what we are proposing.  Bear in mind the DWR and Dept
of Finance may well seek substantial changes in this language.  Thanks, Mike

Late yesterday, the Governor met with various large users including the
Chamber, CMTA, WSPA, CLECA, CRA and BOMA.  They are all opposed to the bill
for a variety of reasons but most importantly, because the entire repayment
burden rests on their shoulders.  CLECA, CMTA and WSPA are especially upset

some golf pro bought and then six months later he got a hole in one, won a

costs about the same as a Jetta, which is sort of a steal. Again, I'll have

Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.
RICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

Los Angeles Times
Home Edition

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said. 
""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. ""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with ""moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy.""

VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	It wasn't as big a day funding wise compared to yesterday's $300 million windfall, but eight companies still managed to pull in a respectable $186 million. The big fundings went to three companies, all in the fourth round. Chorum Technologies, a provider of all-optical processors and subsystems for optical networks, raised $54.7 million in its fourth round of funding led by previous investors CenterPoint Ventures, InterWest Partners, Sevin Rosen Funds, and Scudder-Kemper Investments. 

Four was also a lucky number for Encorp, a provider of products and services for the power-technology sector, that closed $38.1 million in Series D financing led by new investor Ballentine Capital Partners. Meanwhile 2Wire, a developer of products that provide broadband content and services throughout the home, announced that it closed its fourth round of funding at $61 million that VentureWire first reported in August.

prepared for you.  A number of questions/concerns come to mind.  I briefly 
discussed these concerns with Sue Nord late last week, but wanted to put them 
before the group for possible discussion on our next conference call. 

When I read the memo from Stamos (Illinois counsel), it appeared to me that 
the categories of requirements might be able to be divided into ""regulatory"" 
responsibilities vs ""commercial"" requirements.  In the regulatory column 
would be things like the annual designation of an agent and the annual 
identification of the CEO.  Also, the certificate itself needs to be renewed 
every 2 years (FYI--I don't think I saw that requirement in the chart)  Other 
items such as participation in the One Call Notice System and the tax 
contributions might fall into the commercial category.

These requirements not only need to be kept track of and adherred to, but 
there is also the consideration of what the resource costs are associated 
with them for both the IXC certifcations and the CLEC certifications.  And 
are there penalties in place if we don't comply?  

Scott/Donald/Sue--can we discuss next call?

	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Washington, D.C. entrepreneur Ted Pierson is betting on 
a boom in bandwidth trading. 
	His company, LighTrade Inc., will spend $20 million-$25 million this year to 
install and operate hardware to trade bandwidth, or space on telecom lines, 
in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Miami, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle 
and Washington, D.C. 
	Bandwidth trading is growing, driven by increased demand by businesses for 
the Internet. In a report released last December, CIBC World Markets 
estimated that 20% of total bandwidth traffic, or $12 billion in revenues, 
could be traded in some manner within five years. 
	Last week, Oklahoma energy company Williams Communications Group Inc. (WCG, 
news, msgs) announced plans to open a bandwidth trading unit. 
	LighTrade will be the first company not affiliated with a larger energy or 
telecommunications concern to develop the trading sites, known as pooling 
points, Pierson told Dow Jones Newswires. 
	The points connect telecommunications carriers, allowing data to move from 
one network to another. They are installed in ""telecom hotels,"" buildings 
that house carrier facilities, and essentially consist of a Lucent 
Technologies Inc. (LU, news, msgs) bandwidth manager about the size of a 
tall, narrow refrigerator. 
	Enron Broadband Services, a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs), 
established the first two points last year in New York and Los Angeles. It 
plans to build another in London this year. 
	Last year, Enron Corp. proposed trading bandwidth under a standardized 
contract. It executed the first trade under the contract in December, buying 
space on a monthly basis on a New York-Los Angeles line from Global Crossing 
Ltd. of Bermuda. 
	Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based technology research firm, 
has charged that Enron's ownership of pooling points prevents neutrality in 
bandwidth trades. 
	Having an independent company like LighTrade operate points will help the 
bandwidth trading market get off the ground, said Stephen Kamman, a 
telecommunications industry analyst for CIBC World Markets. 
	It's a ""very positive"" development for the bandwidth trading market, said Tom 
Gros, vice president of international bandwidth trading for Enron. 
	""This is the first of what I think will be at least a few others who are 
interested in building pooling points that meet the Enron specifications for 
the open trading of bandwidth,"" Gros said. 
	The industry has been trading bandwidth without a standardized contract for 
years. Deals have typically taken weeks or months to negotiate. Companies 
must start from scratch with each deal, negotiating price, quantity, length 
of contract and quality of service. 
	In the past, deals have been long-term, sometimes as long as 20 years. But 
with the cost of bandwidth along some routes declining 15%-20% a year, such 
terms are less attractive. 
	Enron has also called on telecommunications companies to form a bandwidth 
trading organization, an independent body that will decide on standard terms 
and conditions for trading. Two groups in London and one in the United States 
are vying to form such a group. 
	LighTrade chose pooling point sites based on telecommunications traffic, 
Pierson said. Long-range plans call for the company to have sites in the 50 
U.S. cities that develop the most traffic. 
	But the company's pace building a network of points will depend on how 
quickly the telecommunications industry can decide on standards for trading 
bandwidth as a commodity. 
	LighTrade wants to install points in Boston, Houston, Las Vegas, Memphis and 
Phoenix in 2001, Pierson said. It is eyeing a move into international markets 
as early as next year, if the market will support it. Western Europe is a 
likely starting point, with Paris and Frankfurt possible sites. 
	Eventually, LighTrade could connect Miami to a South American city like Rio 
de Janeiro or Sao Paulo, and build Asian pooling points in sites like Tokyo 
and Osaka. 
	The company raised financing from private investors in two rounds last year 
and is now looking for investment from venture capital companies. 
	In addition to reaching an agreement with Lucent Technologies to use its 
bandwidth managers, LighTrade has another connection to the high-tech 
company. William Plunkett, a senior vice president at Lucent, is on 
LighTrade's board of directors. Pierson declined to say whether Lucent would 
invest in his company. 
	LighTrade isn't Pierson's first startup company. The telecommunications 
attorney founded Advanced Radio Telecom (ARTT, news, msgs), a NASDAQ-traded 
company that owns and operates broadband wireless metropolitan area networks. 
That company now has market capitalization of $800 million. 
	Pierson has commitments to tie pooling points into the networks of three 
major telecommunications carriers, he said. He wouldn't identify the 
companies. He said he doesn't know of any competitors building pooling 
points, but he expects others to enter the market. 
	He and his investors are taking a chance starting a company to develop 
pooling points because they don't know how quickly the market will develop, 
he said. 
	""But I wouldn't be in it if ... I did not think this would be a very 
significant economic return,"" Pierson said.

Dear Jeffrey:

Sandy Robertson and Les Vadasz -- if the term ""key""
could be applied to anyone financing private technology
companies, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone to match
their experience and portfolios. What is their take on
what companies need to prove to attract investment?
What financing models do they see are best suited for
2002? What valuations are you likely to be getting in
your next rounds? On November 6, in San Jose, they'll
be sharing the answers to these and many other
questions at:

Managing the downturn: Survival strategies for 2002
VentureWire Executive Summit
The Fairmont, San Jose
November 6, 2001

http://events.venturewire.com/summit/default.asp

Robertson is a true pioneer in start-up finance. Since
1999, he has been running Francisco Partners, the firm
he co-founded, which is the world's largest private
equity fund focused on technology. Of course, prior
to that he had founded Robertson, Stephens & Company
as well as Montgomery Securities. In all, he has financed
over 500 technology companies, including AOL, Dell, Siebel
and Sun, and supported companies and CEOs in good times
and bad. What does he think should be the focus for
technology entrepreneurs and financiers in 2002? What
are your best options for preventing your company from
suffering a liquidity crunch?

Vadasz operates the world's most extensive corporate
development program at Intel Capital. Last year, they
put $1.3 billion into start-ups, and their portfolio
currently includes 550 companies. As part of Intel's
founding team in 1968, he's had various management
responsibilities within the company. He brings a great
blend of operational management expertise and investment
focus to the summit. He'll help us understand the
investment and valuation criteria that Intel applies
to candidates and share insight on the organizational
structures and focus best suited to ride out the
current market malaise.

We're delighted the roster of contributing speakers is
a ""who's who"" of the industry. Take a look at the panel
on the right to get a sense of others who are participating.
Through both flush and difficult times, they have built,
financed and led great companies, and gone on to turn
those companies into major industry players. Their
leadership ability and insight on people management
and motivation has been put to the test in the past.
What do they believe are the key factors influencing
their own and others' success? Discovering how to pull
through the down market and emerge well-positioned to
exploit the rebound will be fascinating.

How are you structuring your company to survive and
grow in 2002? These and other key experts will share
best-practice strategies for all operational aspects.
Whether you're looking for new financing, cash management
models, product development, sales and marketing
strategies, human resources insight or the building
of corporate partnerships and other strategic
relationships, attending VentureWire's Executive
Summit on November 6 will be a key. Join the valley's
leading executives and investors. Learn from the direct
experiences of the heavy hitters on how to manage your
company through the downturn and be among the first to
ride the upturn when it comes.

587,"As we discussed in our special call last week, I asked Brian Cragg from 
Goodin McBride to look into the issue of what, if anything, the CPUC can do 
in lieu of suspending direct access.

ABX 1 says the CPUC ""shall suspend"" DA, but does not give any time line for 
doing so, nor any criterita to use in making the determination to suspend 
it.  This gives the CPUC ample ability to delay suspending DA, especially 
while bills affecting DA are in play in Sacramento. The President could have 
her own investigation or propose her own solutions -- all the while delaying 
the suspension.  Brian also thought she could possibly put her own DA plan in 
place -- although he said it was a ""stretch.""  Brian said she could, for 
example, argue that limiting DA to the net short position was a way of 
implementing ABX 1.  He felt that adding an exit fee as well was , however, 
stretching the concept a bit too far.  Nonethless, limiting DA to a net short 
position could be argued to be within her existing authority under the law. 
She could also institute an ""open season"" through some defined date, such as 
Jan 1, 2002, and suspend DA thereafter.

She could take this action subject to the passage of superceding legislation 
-- which, of course, could either kill DA altogether or implement some 
combination of exit fee/DAopen season/DA limitation.

Let's discuss strategy on our next call.

592,"Calif DWR Seen Asking PUC To Order 25% Rate Increase Fri
By Jason Leopold

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
(This article was originally published earlier Friday.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Department of Water Resources, the
agency purchasing a bulk of the state's power needs in lieu of the three
investor-owned utilities, is expected to tell state regulators Friday that
they need to increase electricity rates by as much as 25%.

This is because there are insufficient funds in the current revenue stream
to cover a $13.4 billion bond sale, three commissioners with the Public
Utilities Commission told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday.

PUC President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue a draft decision Friday
either endorsing the rate hike request or calling for an audit of the DWR's
current revenue stream before she makes a decision, aides in her office
said.

If the PUC determines that there are not enough funds in the current rate
structure to cover the bond sale, it will have no choice but to order the
rate increase, according to the legislation that put the state in the power
buying business.

Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase,
the second in just two months, if approved by the PUC, the commissioners
said.
""Back in May when we ordered the first rate increase, we said we may be
forced to do it again by the summer,"" one commissioner said.

""It's unfortunate, but it shouldn't be a shock to anyone. The state has
made an enormous commitment to Wall Street that rates would go up whenever
it's needed to ensure there is enough money to pay off those bonds.""

Lynch and a spokesman for the DWR were unavailable for comment late
Thursday.

Separately, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has
drafted a proposal expected to be introduced into the Assembly Friday or
Saturday that would have large businesses using the most electricity to
finance the bulk of the $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts,
aides in his office said.
Moreover, Keeley's plan is aimed at reducing rates for consumers who use
the least amount of power. Details of the plan are still sketchy, aides

Possible Rate Hike To Generate $2.5B Yearly For State

The 50% rate increase ordered in May is expected to generate $5 billion
annually, and if the PUC orders a 25% increase, that is expected to
generate $2.5 billion. However, it is still unclear if that is enough, the
commissioners said.

Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase,
the second in four months, if approved by the PUC, the three commissioners
said.
Since January, the state has spent nearly $8.5 billion buying electricity
on behalf of customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern
California Edison, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric and
PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric.

The state has borrowed more than $7 billion from its general fund, which
must be repaid by ratepayers at 6% interest, to purchase power.

In addition, the state has locked itself into $43 billion in long-term
power supply contracts at high prices for as much as 20 years to ensure
there is enough power to meet demand. Future rate increases to finance the
contracts are likely, state officials have said.

But if the PUC orders another rate increase, the money won't benefit the
utilities, which have billions of dollars in power costs to recover.
Instead, it will be used to guarantee Wall Street financial institutions
that there is sufficient funds in the rate structure to allow $13.4 billion
in revenue bonds to be sold.

The bonds are expected to be sold in August or September, said state
Treasurer Phil Angelides.

The commissioners said the PUC and the DWR waited to address another rate
hike to see if state officials and generators were successful in coming to
terms on $8.9 billion the state says it was overcharged for power since
last year.

After two weeks of hearings between generators and a delegation of
California utility executives and energy officials, talks broke down
Monday. Generators offered the state $716 million in refunds, but Gov. Gray
Davis balked, threatening to sue to recover the full $8.9 billion.

Any refunds would have been disbursed to the utilities and the DWR, which
could have deferred the need for any rate increase, according to Steve
Maviglio, press secretary to Davis.

An administrative law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
said Thursday he will recommend that the commission not order cash refunds
to California because the state's utilities owe far more money to the
generators than what he thinks the state is owed.

A subpoena was issued to Morgan Stanley, who was retained to prepare 
documents related to the sale of some of California's generation assets.

????????????? ?NOTE: ?The point is that the price paid for generation assets 
was ""much higher"" than many experts anticipated. ?The committee will be 
looking into whether generators purchased these assets at significantly 
higher prices because they knew they would have market power -- and the

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/10/2001 



GOVERNOR DAVIS ORDERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO CUT ENERGY USE 

Order Calls for Streamlining of Energy Demand Reduction Plans 

LOS ANGELES 

Governor Gray Davis today signed Executive Order D-39-01, which authorizes 
the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to implement voluntary, 
emergency load curtailment programs for commercial, industrial or other large 
businesses. In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power 
emergencies, the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating 
customers. 

""Nearly 70 percent of energy usage in California is commercial,"" Governor 
Davis said. ""Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even 
avoid blackouts. Therefore, I am ordering the Department of Water Resources 
to implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they 
voluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods.""

The Governor's order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent 
load curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent 
System Operator, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Investor-Owned 
Utilities. 

The DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer 2001 and Summer 
2002 and the DWR will finance the customer incentives. The incentives will be 
determined by a number of factors, including the size of the customer and the 
amount of energy to be curtailed. The overall cost for the program, estimated 
to be between $50-100 million, will ultimately depend on the number of 
customers who sign up.

Dear Mr. Dasovich,

Energy Restructuring in the Southwest conference, co-sponsored by Energy
Newsdata Corporation

When/Where: July 19 and 20, 2001 at the Alexis Park in Las Vegas

While California=01,s electric system stumbles from crisis to crisis during=
 a
continuing state of emergency, states and municipalities throughout the
Western region are reexamining and, in some cases, reversing their policies
regarding restructuring of the electric services industry. This has
resulted in ever-changing and confusing laws and policies affecting
utilities, energy service providers and consumers in Arizona, Nevada and
New Mexico.

This conference will help lay the groundwork for a better understanding of
current market and regulatory conditions in the Southwest, and the faculty
of expert speakers will provide insight as to how evolving policies will
shape markets of the future.

Program Co-chairs: Arthur O'Donnell of California Energy Markets and Fred
Schmidt of Hale Lane Peek Dennison Howard & Anderson.

Attached you will find your Spring '01 schedule as of Round I. For those of
you taking elective classes, Round II is another opportunity to make
adjustments to your schedule. Please note the following:

(1) To make any adjustments to your schedule, you must e-mail me with the
changes you'd like to make. In your e-mail, please include which courses you
want to add or drop, how many one-unit courses you would like to have, and
the total number of units you want for the Spring '01 semester. The deadline
to make adjustments to your schedule in Round II is Monday, November 20 at
noon. The next opportunity you will have to make schedule changes will be
through the add/drop process with me in January during the first week of
classes.

(2) If you got into more than one one-unit course and there is a meeting
time conflict, please e-mail me which of the two one-unit courses you prefer
to take.

(3) If you are interested in enrolling in day classes, you may do so by
e-mailing me which course you would like take. Your name will go on a list,
and during the first week of classes, I will find out the availability of
seats in that class. I will then let you know whether you got into the

619,"Attached is a paper that was filed at the FERC by Paul Joskow and Ed Kahn.  I 
assume it was attached to SCE's comments in the FERC price caps proceeding.

This study appears to be the most definite analysis so far of the question: 
did market fundamentals or generator market power cause the price run-ups 
this summer?  Joskow/Kahn conclude that although much of the run up was due 
to gas prices and NOx costs, that the market was unworkably competitive; 
i.e., the cost run ups do not fully explain the price run ups.  Further, they 
provide what they claim is evidence that individual generators withheld this 
summer.

Joskow/Kahn state: ""Moreover, there is considerable empirical
evidence to support a presumption that the high prices experienced in the 
summer of
2000 were the product of deliberate actions on the part of generators or 
marketers
controlling the dispatch of generating capacity to withhold supply and 
increase market
prices.""  Biggest withholders in their analysis are: AES/Williams, Reliant, 
and Dynegy

Marketer/traders are largely but not completely spared criticism in their 
analysis.  Joskow/Kahn recommend that FERC staff undertake a study of the 
entire WSCC data to ""Determine the role of marketers in the production and 
bidding behavior of the California generators."" and to find out more why CA 
imports fell.

It will be interesting to see how the CA generators react to this study.

My initial read is that this is will be received as an important, influential 
work.  It will fuel the fire for more information release, especially by the 
UDCs and CA regulators--at least release of physical operational data.

I would be interested in your reaction to the study.  In terms of potential 
criticisms: I noticed that their gas prices might be low (used monthly 
average data rather than daily).  They also did not account for generator 
marginal profit or margin recovery to account for possible outages and 
noncontiguous schedules.   Finally, they do not examine the benefits that 
would have accrued had additional capacity come on line.

25 Leaders for a Dangerous Time

05/14/2001
Business Week
EB24
(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The Internet forced a revolution in the way companies are managed. For the 
CEOs of upstarts and Old Economy players alike, the focus has been on making 
decisions in a heartbeat, innovating fast, and looking for ways to tap the 
Net to reach new customers and streamline operations. Now we're in the midst 
of what experts say could be the biggest tech slowdown in 15 years. With the 
pressure on to cut costs and meet quarterly earnings expectations, what's a 
CEO to do? 
Ask our e.biz 25. These are the most influential people in 
e-business--everybody from empire builders like AOL Time Warner Chairman 
Steve Case to Monica Luechtefeld, executive vice-president of e-commerce at 
retailer Office Depot. Those two have wisely built bridges between the worlds 
of bricks and clicks. Their advice is bold: Don't just hunker down and try to 
wait it out. Invest, build, develop new products, and prepare for the 
upswing. Technology and the Internet may not be growing licketysplit, but 
they aren't going away. Says Jeffrey K. Skilling, CEO of Enron Corp., one of 
our 25: ``A lot of people will pull back. They will be missing tremendous 
opportunities. Those with capital and talent should push forward and widen 
the lead.''
Doing this in the face of a trigger-happy Wall Street will require dynamic 
leadership and cast-iron stomachs. We've got that on our e.biz 25. These are 
the pioneers, the people with the new ideas, the out-of-box thinkers, and the 
survivors--especially the survivors--who will shape e-business for years to 
come. 
Some of our 25 have been on the list before. Michael Dell, CEO of Dell 
Computer Corp., for one. He's a pioneer who has used the Net to reach 
customers and revamp his supply chain. Now, in the midst of the downturn, 
Dell is turning up the heat on competitors by slashing prices ruthlessly. 
Thanks to his foundation of Net technologies, Dell can do this and still make 
a profit. The result could be a massive restructuring of the PC industry, 
with some of Dell's competitors losing market share at a gallop. 
Others land on the list because of their potential for shaking up the status 
quo. Example: Rick Belluzzo, Microsoft Corp.'s president. Microsoft has been 
ho-hum on the Net--until now. Belluzzo has turned Microsoft's MSN into the 
No. 2 portal on the Web, and now the company is committed to spending $2 
billion this year on research & development for its .Net strategy for 
supercharging the Web. It may well make the Net more useful--and easier to 
use. And Microsoft could leapfrog from laggard to leader. 
Then there are the folks whose future is very much in doubt--and that makes 
them even more important to watch. Squarely on the e.biz hot seat sits Jeff 
Bezos of e-tailer Amazon.com Inc. With the online superstore's revenue growth 
slowing and its $15 stock off its peak by 85%, the man who scared the bejesus 
out of the nation's traditional retailers isn't so terrifying now. But he's 
still the trailblazer of e-tailing. Whether he fails miserably or triumphs in 
the end, how he fares will tell us much about the next episode in the 
Internet saga. ``This is a good time to learn, to explore, to get ready,'' 
says Rosabeth M. Kanter, professor at Harvard Business School. 
Indeed, economic slumps have been launchpads for companies who know how to 
take advantage of them. The outfits that are likely to pick up momentum in 
this downturn are the companies that create or adopt new technology, 
experiment with new business models, and expand aggressively. That's 
certainly been true in the past. During the 1990-91 recession, EMC Corp. 
focused on high-end storage technologies and innovated its way through hard 
times. Chrysler retooled its design process and began farming out component 
manufacturing to partners--and was the only one of the Big Three to post a 
profit in 1992. Arrow Electronics bought smaller competitors and expanded in 
Europe, emerging as the No. 1 electronics distributor in the world. 
``Slowdowns can be a great opportunity for companies that are prepared. It's 
time for the strong to get stronger, and for the relatively weak to get 
stronger, too,'' says Orit Gadiesh, Chairman of consulting firm Bain & Co. 
The Internet's early winners focused on boosting sales. But during a 
downturn, that's not nearly enough. The Net can be used to supercharge every 
aspect of a company's operations, from market research and customer service 
to engineering collaboration and linking up suppliers. Consider e.biz 25 
member Pradeep Sindhu, co-founder of Juniper Networks Inc. He used this 
wall-to-wall approach to make his four-year-old upstart the leader in 
high-end network routers. It was built from the ground up to capitalize on 
the Net. The company takes orders over the Web and automatically passes them 
to contract manufacturers who make and ship the products. This frees Juniper 
to concentrate on designing products that trounce the competition. The 
payoff: Juniper's operating margin hovers around 30%, nearly double the 
average in the hardware business. 
The most successful e-businesses don't just chase the latest hot idea. They 
figure out which technologies are really right for them. Gary M. Reiner, 
chief information officer at General Electric Co., one of our e.biz 25, 
turned up his nose when many industrial companies joined consortiums that set 
up public e-marketplaces. GE has instant economies of scale with its 11 
different businesses, so it can reap huge savings by combining all their 
buying into the company's own private e-marketplace. GE expects to save $600 
million on procurement over the Web in 2001. 
Many established companies rapidly spun off independent Internet divisions, 
and for some--NBC, for example--that turned out to be a mistake. The latest 
thinking is that companies like retailer Office Depot got it right. It set up 
an independent organization, run by Luechtefeld, but its bricks and clicks 
are cemented together. For instance, customers who need something immediately 
can check online to see if the item is in stock at their local Office Depot. 
The company logged $850 million in online sales last year, making it the No. 
2 online retailer after Amazon.com 
In a downturn, charismatic leadership is more important than ever. With 
revenues sinking and stock options underwater, workers need reasons to 
believe. ``You have to persuade people to stay with you for the ride,'' says 
Haim Mendelson, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. 
While most companies are laying off, some, like Sun Microsystems Inc., pledge 
to do so only as a last resort. CEO Scott McNealy, one of our e.biz 25, 
believes layoffs break a social contract with employees. By holding back, 
``we're protecting the long-term shareholder value,'' he says. 
For CEOs who have been the company's visionaries during the Net's go-go 
years, now is the time to buckle down and pay attention to operations. It's 
advice that Amazon's Bezos takes to heart. The company's goal is to post an 
operating profit--excluding special charges--in the fourth quarter. He's 
concentrating on operating efficiencies. And he's using Net technology to get 
there. Right now, Amazon is installing a system that will automatically route 
e-mails from customers to the appropriate service representative, saving time 
and money. 
Bean-counting may be back, but so is fear. And leaders who let themselves be 
ruled by fear won't be able to handle the balancing act that's required of 
them in these difficult times. ``Some people pay lip service to the 
principles of leadership, but they flush it away when they're running 
scared,'' says Raymond Miles, professor emeritus at the Haas School of 
Business at the University of California at Berkeley. These 25 show no sign 
of turning tail.

was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities such as 
electricity and natural gas--by phone or fax--was a natural fit for the Web. 
Over the past year, Enron has taken online trading to a new level, harnessing 
the Web to bring Enron's risk-management prowess to everything from metals to 
high-speed communications. ``Our volumes are way up,'' says Skilling. 
Try through the roof. EnronOnline handles 5,000 transactions per day. The 
company posts prices on more than 1,500 products that it stands ready to buy 
or sell to utilities, municipalities, and other big wholesale customers. 
Since November, 1999, EnronOnline has traded more than $525 billion worth of 
commodities, making it the Web's biggest and most successful 
business-to-business site. 
Skilling's most challenging move: high-speed communications bandwidth. In the 
past year, Enron has spent $436 million to create its own 15,000-mile 
fiber-optic network to provide real-time bandwidth to customers. Because of a 
supply glut and falling prices, bandwidth trading is struggling. In March, 
Enron suffered a major blow with the abrupt cancellation of its 
video-on-demand pact with Blockbuster Inc. Skilling says the deal was called 
off because Blockbuster wasn't getting movies from Hollywood studios fast 
enough. 
Such setbacks don't faze Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant who 
graduated in the top 5% of his Harvard Business School class. He sees almost 
no limit to what Enron can trade--even ad space is a possibility. ``The Net 
allows you to touch lots of customers inexpensively,'' he says. Not bad for 
mere commodities. 


USA: El Paso opens bids to expand Calif. natgas lines.

05/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, May 11 (Reuters) - El Paso Corp. said Friday two of its units are to 
test the market's appetite to expand capacity on two natural gas lines into 
energy-starved California, where gas prices are the highest in the nation. 
El Paso unit El Paso Natural Gas Company started taking open bids May 1 and 
will close its so-called open season on May 25 for new capacity on a proposed 
two-way line between Daggett, Calif. and Ehrenberg, Ariz., El Paso said in a 
statement.
El Paso unit Mojave Pipeline Co. is also holding an open season from May 10 
to May 31 for its Sacramento Valley project, which would add capacity along 
an expanded Mojave pipeline system from Topock, Ariz., to Antioch and 
Sacramento in Northern California. 
No estimates were immediately available as to how much capacity El Paso, the 
largest supplier of natural gas to California, was considering adding to each 
system, an El Paso spokeswoman said. 
El Paso currently delivers more than 3 trillion cubic feet of gas a day, or 
about 45 percent, to California through four receiving points at the 
California-Arizona border. 
The El Paso open seasons are the latest in a flurry of market activity to 
expand or build new natural gas pipelines California, where demand for 
natural gas is expected to surge to meet demand from a growing number of 
gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for construction. 
Natural gas is already used to generate about a third of California's 
electrcity. 
Since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Sempra Energy unit 
Southern California Gas Co, Williams Cos' Kern River Transmission, Pacific 
Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, Questar Corp. , Calpine 
Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Software Promises Bandwidth Broker In A Box
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

05/11/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Call it a bandwidth broker in a box. 
That's perhaps the easiest way to describe the promise of Invisible Hand 
Networks Inc.'s Merkato software system.
Merkato, which the Burlington, Mass., company is planning to roll out in the 
coming months, assesses the amount of bandwidth being used on a network and 
then electronically offers the unneeded portion to others for sale. 
Like existing online bandwidth trading platforms, Merkato, named for the 
Italian word for marketplace, can be operated manually by the network 
operator. Unlike other online services it can operate automatically. 
""Bandwidth traders are trading circuits and they're trading circuits between 
carriers,"" said Invisible Hand Chief Executive Glenn Ricketts. ""True 
liquidity is not going to be created by carriers trading circuits."" 
Bandwidth traders and industry analysts are skeptical about Merkato living up 
to its promise for real-time, scalable bandwidth provisioning. 
""It's a solution in search of problem,"" said a bandwidth brokerage founder. 
""Algorithms shouldn't clear trades, people should - with algorithms 
supporting and advising their potential decisions."" 
Software Built On Algorithms 
Algorithms are at the heart of Merkato's operation. The algorithms were 
developed by Nemo Semret, one of the company's founders, while pursuing his 
Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Columbia University. 
Semret developed what's essentially a mathematical model using game theory 
and market economics for auctioning bandwidth, an instantly perishable 
commodity, Ricketts said. 
Merkato contacts other Merkato users to see if they are buying or selling 
bandwidth. It will then execute the trade automatically or it will come back 
to ask approval to execute the trade or seek more guidance if some of the 
conditions set for the trade aren't met. 
Software platforms like Enron Online or those provided by brokers require a 
person to set prices and execute the trade. 
""It'll be great if it works,"" said William Bandt, an analyst with Arthur 
Andersen L.L.P. ""The devil is in the details. This dynamic allocation could 
be a big deal."" 
One early user of Merkato, Thin Portals Network in New York, has been testing 
the software for three months. The company is a managed hosting and 
colocation facility. 
""It's a way to create an auction, a new market, very easily,"" said David 
Simon, head of Thin Portals. ""It's an exchange in a box. All you need is the 
product and the connectivity. It's just that easy."" 
Simon declined to say exactly how he plans to use Merkato. 
Invisible Hand hopes to license the Merkato software to carriers and 
bandwidth providers who want to sell excess capacity to their clients.

I have been looking at your numbers and I have a few questions.

1).     If we look at this from the stand point of the Time shareholder's,
we do not really need to worry about the make-up of Time-Paramount after
the merger.  Since this is an all cash deal, the purchase price will be
given to Time's shareholders.  This amount needs to be above the DCF of the
Time-Warner deal for us to suggest it.

2).     As for the taxes maybe Mark can shed some light on the
issue.  During the acquisition phase the only taxes that will be paid will
be the capital gains paid by Time Shareholders.  Paramount will not pay
taxes on the purchase.  Paramount's tax position will improve due to the
increased debt payments.  Looking at it from Time shareholder's we really
don't care do we?  Maybe I am wrong.

Otherwise everything looked good.  I like the common sized balance
sheet.  I should be home all day tomorrow.  Call me at 925-362-0210 and let
me know how I can pitch in.

	FERC Price Probe Eliminated from Barton CA Bill 
	A proposal calling on FERC to conduct a formal investigation into wholesale 
power rates in western markets has been stripped out of the latest discussion 
draft of emergency legislation that was released Tuesday by Chairman Joe 
Barton (R-TX) of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee. 
	Instead of proposing that the Commission undertake a Section 206 probe to 
determine if prices are ""just and reasonable,"" which could lead eventually to 
price controls, Barton's latest draft provides a mix of demand-management 
incentives, environmental waivers, proposals to eliminate or reduce 
transmission constraints, energy conservation measures and emergency 
preparedness initiatives to mitigate ballooning wholesale electricity and 
natural gas prices in ailing markets in California and other western states. 
	The decision to peel out the provision on the FERC price investigation did 
not come as a major surprise, given the Republicans' unyielding opposition to 
any federal intervention in wholesale power prices. However, this move could 
make it all the more difficult to report a bill out of the subcommittee and 
the full House Energy and Commerce Committee in light of Democratic members' 
support for price caps and/or cost-based rates.

659,"Two of the three Commission-hired witnesses testified today -- Peter
Bradford and George Sterzinger.  While Bradford did nothing to really help
or hurt our cause, Sterzinger was amazingly helpful.  He practically
endorsed Enron's proposal.  He noted that it was the best design to elicit
strong conservation response by, as he put it, ""grabbing hold of some of the
usage and making it responsive to the manipulation of the market.""  The idea
was that customers would respond to the high prices which, are the product
of market manipulation, by reducing usage.  He focused alot on the
decremenatal usage credit and the incentive it would provide to conserve.
He proposed an alternative manner of funding in that the rebate would be
flowed back to customers as a bill reduction over an extended period of
time.  He also noted that he would implement the proposal as a voluntary one
(at least initially).

As to the other parties proposals, on cross, he expressed strong concerns
about shifting usage from peak to should peak (as that does nothing but
shift the peak period) and stressed that the Commission should carefully
examine any rate design which would have the potential to do such.  He also
testified that of the two forms of conservation being discussed in this
proceeding -- load shifting or load reduction -- the latter was far more
important and that the goal should be to lower energy usage at all times.

All in all, not a bad afternoon for our proposal.  His testimony appears to
have renewed interest in what was beginning to look like a nonstarter.

Tomorrow, the remaining Commission witness (Bornstein) is up.  Followed by
Bill Marcus for TURN, and PG&E witness Coyne.  The billing constraint

interest.  If this is your choice of activity, please let me know and I will 
reserve a bike and map for you enjoyment.

After reviewing the choices above, please select an activity you prefer to 
take part in.  Due to the fact that our group is so large, (which makes it 
more difficult to coordinate activities) once you select an activity, we ask 
that you not change your selection.  So, please talk to your colleagues ahead 
of time before making your choice.

Thanks and don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.

662,"Yesterday in a conversation with Mike Day, he confirmed we have no basis in 
AB 1890 or anything else to claim entitlement to continuation of some type of 
market based credits.  Given that interpretation, we tentatively decided the 
advice letter protest would be drafted to say at least these things -
1)  the PE credit should include the 4 cents of surcharge (the 1 from January 
plus the latest 3 now subject to rate design hearings)
2)  there is no restriction on the PE credit going negative.
3)  the tariff should be clarified to say it excludes DWR purchases, assuming 
that is the case.

If we are going to otherwise object to the Advice Letter, the approach could 
be:
1) the Commission needs to generically address the replacement of PX credits 
and not allow one utility to change it through an advice letter;
2) the Commission has not addressed the entitlement of DA customers to hydro 
assets and must make a determination on this;
3) if the Commission approves this Advice Letter, it should say SCE has no 
further claim to stranded costs on its generation;
4) as an interim measure until the Commission fully looks at PX credit 
calculations,  we recommend that SCE adopt a PX proxy, such as Dow Jones.

This approach allows us to argue process rather than entitlement to market 
based credits.  Given all the time constrains, I'd suggest we capture these 
latter issues through a very simple 1-2 paragraphs.

Bob, I know you're getting a call together; I'll call you to confirm.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

BODY:

???Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went
without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of
California's power crisis.

??Edison International's chairman and chief executive, John Bryson, was paid
$950,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $2.16 million in 
1999.

??Stephen Frank, the chairman and chief executive at Southern California
Edison, was paid $617,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling 
$1.3
million in 1999, according to the company's proxy statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

??The company also said Thursday it would not award merit increases to
executives in 2001 because of the continuing crisis.

??In a similar statement released Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric Corp.
revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives, although they 
did
receive raises.

??Edison and PG&E say they have lost nearly $14 billion since June to high
wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from
passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs 
from
regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 
6.

??Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its

??reditors.

HEADLINE: Energy officials accused of manipulating natural gas market defend
actions

BYLINE: By Andres LaMar

BODY:

??SACRAMENTO _ Energy officials who are accused of manipulating California's
market for natural gas defended their actions on Thursday and attributed the
state's skyrocketing gas prices to increased demand, the weather and other
factors.

??The explanation, however, drew skepticism from lawmakers in the wake of
expert testimony alleging that one Texas firm, El Paso Natural Gas Co., had
engineered a classic case of monopoly power by controlling the pipeline that
delivers gas to the state.

??At the outset of the Thursday's hearing, Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg,
D-Sacramento, noted the huge run-up in the cost of natural gas, which went 
from
$6.6 billion for the entire year of 1999 to $12.3 billion for sales in 2000 
and
to $7.9 billion for the first three months of this year.

??Steinberg zeroed in on the difference between California and other parts of
the country. From March 2000 to February 2001, natural gas prices have risen 
489
percent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent 
jump
in Chicago.

??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads, the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co.
subsidiary, for an explanation.

??""The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to 
constraints
on the pipeline and demand?"" Steinberg asked.

??""Yes,"" Eads replied. Eads said the state's energy crisis, which led power
plants to run harder and longer, dramatically increased demand for natural gas
over the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than 
the
year before exacerbated the problem.

??In another twist to California's deregulation nightmare, El Paso officials
said they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time, PG&E's
movement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the 
Public
Utilities Commission.

??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday, lawmakers called on the
federal government to re- regulate natural gas sales at the California border
and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said federal regulators should impose
price caps on California's wholesale electricity market.

??The Assembly held considerable debate on the resolution asking for
re-regulation, with Democrats accusing President George W. Bush of doing 
nothing
to come to the aid of California and Republicans defending the administration.

??""I'm learning an interesting lesson that all the problems of the world
started after Jan. 21 and the inauguration of the new president,"" said
Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino.

A U-TURN ON CAR TAX REBATES;

LEGISLATION: STARTING JULY 1, FEE REDUCTION WILL BE FIGURED DIRECTLY INTO
VEHICLE REGISTRATION BILLS, NOT REFUNDED BY MAIL.

BYLINE: CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER



DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:


??Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a U-turn Thursday and scrapped a
costly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then 
get a
rebate in the mail.

??Starting July 1, the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners of
approximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced 
by
the amount of the vehicle license fee rebates.

??On a unanimous roll call, the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davis
an ""urgency"" bill, SB 52, that repealed the rebate program, which the governor
had previously fought for and defended.

??In addition to abolishing the rebates, the legislation reduces by 67.5% the
amount motorists must pay for the upcoming year, the level that lawmakers and
former Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. It
had been about 2% of a vehicle's market value.

??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill, saying only that the new law will
""expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs.""

??The governor's muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of the
rebates last year, when he said Californians ""don't appreciate the fact that
they're getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands.""

??At the time, Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting the
car tax, which voters might not notice, or sending checks in the mail, which
Davis felt would have a greater impact.

??The rebates, which began Jan. 1, were scheduled to continue through 2002,
when Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003, the license fee was to have
fallen permanently, with no more rebates.

??""The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorial
election cycle,"" said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who supported
reductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates.

??Until July 1, the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount of
their license fee, which includes a 35% reduction from last year.

??""Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate, making a total reduction
of 67.5%,"" said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals on
July 1, the DMV bills will include the full tax cut.

??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current ""awkward system 
.
. . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and 
then
await a rebate check from the state--a system that is, at best, difficult to
explain.""

??But as the California economy tightened, the state's budget surplus shrank
and taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy 
electricity, 
the costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassment
to Davis.

??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone were
estimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year.

??Last year, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and McClintock sought to
eliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they register
their vehicles. Under pressure from Davis, the bill failed.

??""It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor,""
McClintock said Thursday. ""He didn't want it on his desk.""

??This year, Dunn launched a similar bill, but his name was struck from it as
the lead author in the Assembly and the name of Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata) 
was
substituted.

??In a speech Thursday, Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) suggested that Davis'
performance on the issue in an ""earlier time and a more just society"" would 
have
resulted in his ""public flogging by representatives of taxpayers.""

??The repeal bill was passed 78 to 0 by the Assembly on Monday, and sent to
Davis by the Senate on a 34-0 vote Thursday.

??If the rebates were to be abolished, the bill had to pass this week in order
to take effect July 1, said Branch, the DMV spokesman. This is because 
motorists
must be advised 60 days in advance that their registration renewals are due.

??""We have to reprogram all the computers. We have to print new bills and mail
them by May 1 for the July 1 expiration,"" he said. ""It will be a little tight,
but we will still make it.""

??Branch said that since the Jan. 1 start of rebates, checks totaling $ 454
million have been sent to 7.4 million vehicle owners at an extra 
administrative
cost of $ 9.4 million.

LOCKYER ASKS JUDGE TO ORDER FIRMS TO RELEASE RECORDS

BYLINE: ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS



BODY:


??California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, ratcheting up his investigation of
possible civil and criminal violations by the state's power suppliers, is 
asking
a San Francisco judge to order two firms to hand over confidential records.

??In a motion filed Thursday in Superior Court, Lockyer said Reliant Energy 
and
Mirant Corp. have failed to comply with subpoenas for documents that were to 
be
produced by March 19.

??Amid soaring electricity costs and rolling blackouts, the attorney general
launched an investigation of possible manipulation of wholesale electricity
prices that have skyrocketed to record levels and have financially crippled 
the
state's major utilities.

??Dozens of other public and private power suppliers are complying with the
subpoenas.

??But in an interview, Lockyer accused Reliant and Mirant of stonewalling
investigators ""so they can keep enjoying these exorbitant profits and prices 
for
as long as possible.""

??Ultimately, the companies will have to honor the subpoenas, he said. ""I'm
going to pit bull them,"" he said. ""This is one we win.""

??Both companies say they have done nothing wrong and played by the rules of
California's flawed electricity deregulation plan.

??A spokesman for Houston-based Reliant said Thursday the firm is seeking 
court
action of its own to ensure that sensitive business information will not be
shared with other public agencies or its competitors.

??Last week, Reliant asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to clarify the
attorney general's obligation to keep proprietary information confidential.

??""We're glad to cooperate with his investigation to the extent we can,"" said
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. "" But we have not received sufficient
assurances that Lockyer would keep the data confidential.""

??Lockyer called Reliant's court filing ""frivolous"" and ""propagandistic"" and
insisted that adequate safeguards are in place. He reserves the right under
state law to share information with other government agencies aiding in his
investigation but has said he will keep sensitive business information from
being made public.

??Atlanta-based Mirant demanded and received similar guarantees of
confidentiality, Lockyer said. Mirant did not return phones calls Thursday.

??Lockyer did not discuss details of the probe or the kinds of information 
he's
seeking. But based on the investigation so far, he said, ""it's beginning to 
get
interesting.""

??Other records indicate that the attorney general has sought 91 categories of
information about the power merchants' activities. They include the operation 
of
power plants, trading information that may have been shared by private power
suppliers and bidding strategies in the California market.

LEGISLATORS UNITE OVER ENERGY PRICE ISSUE;
?POWER: BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION CALLED TOGETHER BY DAVIS SAYS U. 
S.
MUST STEP IN TO PROTECT STATE FROM MANIPULATION BY SUPPLIERS.

BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS



BODY:


??This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: 
A
bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought
together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of 
the
problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention.

??""This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,""
Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at 
the
meeting near Los Angeles International airport.

??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must
slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again 
afford
to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity 
on
their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power
suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.

??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly
opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California
Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the
administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed
aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological
belief in a free market.

??""This is not a free-enterprise situation,"" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) 
said
after the meeting. ""In fact, it's just the opposite.""

??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to
California and those charged in other Western states, he said California 
clearly
has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the
FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting 
""market
power"" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.

??Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in
Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in
California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline
into the state.

??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman
(D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats 
and
Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the 
ability
of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been 
much
speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political 
motive
to help the state.

??""We Democrats,"" said Sherman, ""hope very much that our skepticism is proven
wrong.""

??Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the
governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he 
used
the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians
this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five
Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.

??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with 
Bush
to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors
Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in
which, she said, he ""ignored"" her appeal for federal assistance.

??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying 
they
appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up
prices.

??The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an
Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had 
manipulated
the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that
they had, in effect, withheld access to it.

??That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver
gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and 
causing
a surge in prices.

??The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared
in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased
production last year in response to the energy crisis.

??""We're not withholding capacity--no one is,"" said El Paso Merchant Energy
President Ralph Eads. ""With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.""

??In other developments Thursday:

??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing
utility arm to financial health is in ""deep trouble and could be rejected by
legislators,"" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to
clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal ""would 
be
a humiliating setback for the governor,"" S&P said.

??The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's
transmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion 
in
bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison
agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state 
at
prices tied to the cost of producing power.

??Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have
been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to
tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a
bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a
dire outcome.

??But a senior Edison executive said it is ""way too early"" to give up on
passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.

??""There is an education process to do here,"" the executive said of the highly
detailed 38-page document. ""The legislators should be asking questions. That 
is
appropriate.""

??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative
energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from
PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.

??The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits
some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the
cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy
account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.

??""The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot
days of summer,"" Wood said.

??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to
address the $ 700 million the producers are owed. ""All we have gotten is
rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,"" he said.

??* An $ 850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious 
megawatts
appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state
officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.

??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $ 242
million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to
the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation 
programs.

??But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said
Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection
April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.

??Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's
decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could 
follow a
similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.

??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the
Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and
separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the
court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses
anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view
of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late 
spring
and early summer.

??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his
agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their
output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the
necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full 
for
earlier electricity deliveries.

??""It's not a huge amount,"" he said of the anticipated production shortfall,
""but every little bit helps.""

HEADLINE: Federal energy commission considers price fix for state energy 
market

BYLINE: By Dena Bunis

BODY:

??WASHINGTON _ Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's
crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency 
better
look for some other solution.

??Even the short-term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little too late.

??Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight
shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is
some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the
Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures.

??Many are looking to see if President Bush's choices for the two vacancies on
FERC will provide a margin for change.

??But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are 
best
is not likely to change soon, members say.

??""I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for
determining market-based rates,"" Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. 
But
with no success. "" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this
market-based pricing.""

??The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns
down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have 
been
given that authority, he said.

??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, 
it
must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the
market and drive prices up.

??""Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and
lawyers,"" Massey said.

??While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to
the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should 
trigger
cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place 
for
one year, under the staff proposal.

??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has
to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now 
on.

??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, 
is
that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to
manipulate the market and drive prices up.

??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says
Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory
affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts 
associated
with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators 
from
jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said.

??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take
effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation.

??""We're close because summer is approaching,"" Commissioner Linda Breathitt
said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls,
said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California
she was open to considering some short-term measures.

??""It's important to me that we address the summer,"" Breathitt said, but said
she wasn't able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday.

??Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the
power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings
are handled.

??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be
""better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going 
to
be in a Stage 3 emergency.""

??Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to
step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency
period.

??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene ""is putting the whole grid at risk,"" said
Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. ""We have a 
real
stability problem when you cut it that close.""

??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners,
particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will
replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate.

??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman,
Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood
would take as chairman.

??""The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,""
Feinstein said. ""What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal
discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.""

??But once again, timing could be a problem.

??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the
Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate.

??""The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now,
and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,"" Feinstein
said. ""Please please please, President Bush, process your nominees.""

HEADLINE: In response to power woes, rating agencies have California on credit
watch

BYLINE: By Jennifer Bjorhus

BODY:

??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ All three of the nation's influential judges of credit
risk now have California on credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned 
about
the economic impact of the state's power crisis.

??The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned
that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax
revenues in February and March, could spell broader risk for the state's 
budget.

??The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on
California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost
taxpayers millions.

??The announcement comes as state lawmakers mull a bailout plan for Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state
officials bleed through the state's general fund as they purchase expensive
electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that 
the
average daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a 
day
in the last week of March, to $73 million a day.

??Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their 
own
credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded 
the
state's very good double-A credit rating.

??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to 
price
municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer
bondbuyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers.

??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994.

??Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from
stable to negative on April 6, the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for
bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at 
negative
since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities.

??The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was 
the
disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will be
spent.

??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money
generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state
Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the
utilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paid
first, there won't be any money left for it.

??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens
to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of
Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity.

??""With that being appealed you don't have a clean authorization,"" Cohen said.
""It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.""

??A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as
expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below
forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those 
months
fell short by $455 million, or 14% less than expected.

??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs
now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California 
analyst
for Standard & Poors, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern.

??""It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these
projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the
current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of
the problems with the high tech area,"" Hitchcock told analysts and investors
last week in a conference call.

??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn't be
reached for comment. Other economy-watchers expressed concern.

??Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance, said the
move reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon.

??""It's important to note that the rating hasn't been lowered yet and does
remain very strong,"" he said.

HEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay

BYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael Bazeley

BODY:

??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rate
increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour, hit 
bills
beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers.

??Now, much of that is up in the air.

??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June. Exactly which 
consumers
and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a 
rate
structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals.

??Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to
weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric's move into
bankruptcy court.

??""Little details are moving billions of dollars around,"" said Nettie Hoge of
consumer advocate group TURN.

??All the proposals assume a ""tiered"" structure that forces the heaviest users
of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers
could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or
more.

??Among them:

??_How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a
3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month, which would boost utility 
revenue
$4.8 million. Gov. Gray Davis' hike _ left vague in Davis' April 5 television
address _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for 
customers
of Southern California Edison.

??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates
only for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, but Davis 
would
include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers.

??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the
new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more 
than
any of the average increase figures being tossed about.

??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the
time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioner said their increase would take
effect immediately.

??Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge
working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate 
structure
to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission
would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally
lasts nearly a year.

??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential
customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from
higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy
power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline, which 
is
the average basic level of use for each region of the state.

??Each major proposal also sets new ""tiers"" with progressively higher rates 
for
""medium"" use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ""heavy"" use over 200 
percent
of that level.

??But that's where the similarities end.

??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an
assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because 
they
don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half,
commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third.

??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to
everyone else?

??Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E
users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills
increase 36 percent.

??Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent
while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill 
increase
for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20
percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement 
on
the governor's web site.

??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30
percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'.

??The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from
consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential 
increase
of just 7.5 percent.

??TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up
for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law.

??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential
users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher
rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average 
rate
hike of nearly 30 percent.

??""The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,"" said
Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN.

??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for
electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved.

??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive.
Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that
everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use.

??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of
time _ in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a
smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months.

??""It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,"" Paul Clanon, the
commission's director of energy issues.

??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem:
California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the
wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent per
kilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be 
far
from enough.

??In March, the Commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. But Davis
followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for
bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher
rates.

??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis'
proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed
three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined 
to
show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan,
which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.

HEADLINE: Edison pushes lawmakers to accept deal

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: David Lazarus

BODY:
Although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to
acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison, the head of the 
utility's
parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accord could lead 
to
a ""long and costly"" bankruptcy.

???But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The 
Chronicle
that he thought legislators would ""want to do the right thing"" by approving 
the
multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court.

???Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe
consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's
energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates.

???Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least
not in its present form.

???""We are going to go through this thing extensively,"" said state Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. ""There are a lot of concerns
about the valuation.""

???Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long
as Edison is open to amending some of the terms.

???""The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going 
to
have its say,"" Burton said.

???Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain
amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common
ground with lawmakers.

???""The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,""
said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. ""There will be a big effort to 
try
and work something out.""

???Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his 
company
as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith.

???This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned
acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. 
Each
side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations.

???""We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for
the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would
allow us to get on with operating our power system,"" Bryson said.

???Bankruptcy, he said, ""is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly
process.""

???It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating
agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in
warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the 
state's
energy mess.

???""The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,"" said Carol Coale, an
energy-industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. ""This could lead
to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.""

???Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as 
a
prudent alternative to bankruptcy.

???""This is a very good deal for the state,"" he said. ""It is not a bailout.
Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.""

???Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8
billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and 
drop
a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt.

???Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission
system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of
little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired.

???""It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,"" said Doug Heller,
a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa 
Monica.
""Edison gets off scot-free.""

???Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount
paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California 
Public
Utilities Commission in regulating the utility.

???They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the 
state
if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid.

???""The deal on the table is still salvageable,"" said Michael Shames, 
executive
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ""But Edison
needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, 
not
set in stone.""

???For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take
on the issue.

???""We're just at the initial stage,"" he said. ""We always have accepted the
notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the 
laws
of the Public Utilities Commission.""E-mail David Lazarus at

Ontario should open power market

(c) National Post 2001. All Rights Reserved.

In the face of the California crisis, it is all the more important for 
legislators and policymakers -- and for the public generally -- to remember 
why a competitive market structure is so important for electricity consumers. 
The time is right to leave behind the central planning, socialized risk 
structure that resulted in the billions of dollars of stranded costs and 
stranded debt left to consumers in many regions of North America (not just 
Ontario) by poor management, bad planning and enormous cost overruns. That 
can't happen again, and will not happen again in a competitive open market.
In a restructured and competitive electricity market, the risk and cost of 
new investment in generation will be borne by investors and shareholders 
rather than by ratepayers. This protects consumers from bearing the cost of 
bad decisions. 
Last week, the government and Ontario Power Generation (OPG) announced an end 
to the freeze of Ontario's bulk power rates that has been in place for about 
eight years. That will represent an increase of 12% to 15% in bulk power 
rates. It was explained on the basis of the need to pay for the mistakes of 
the past. At Enron, we cannot think of any other jurisdiction in North 
America where a price freeze has been in place for that length of time. 
In future, a competitive market can deliver lower prices than a regulated 
structure can. This is borne out by the experience in Pennsylvania, England 
and other European markets. Pennsylvania estimates that consumers have saved 
US$3-billion over the past three years. In England's first year of customer 
choice (June, 1999 -- June, 2000) consumers saved in excess of 
(ps)299-million ($673-million). In Germany, industrial prices have fallen by 
over 50% since 1995. In Finland, industrial prices have fallen over 23% since 
1995. 
Competition gives customers choice, which gives suppliers and retailers a 
strong incentive to improve customer service, lower prices and develop 
demand-side (load management) solutions. 
This leaves the issue of timing for the opening of the market. 
The Electricity Market Readiness Plan adopted by the Ontario Energy Board and 
the Independent Market Operator targets the systems, processes and other 
requirements of the wholesale and retail markets to be ready for a market 
opening in October/November, 2001. This represents a realistic and achievable 
approach to market opening. 
We see real benefits to opening the market this fall, rather than waiting 
until 2002. Major institutions are gearing up for a market opening later this 
year, and the momentum is ours to lose. Indeed, many participants, including 
large industrial customers, have already entered into the commercial 
arrangements necessary for market opening and the post-market opening period 
in the expectation of market opening later this year. Those commercial 
arrangements with respect to power procurement, power supply, risk 
management, and settlement and dispatch services have helped and are helping 
industrial consumers lock in prices. 
Opening the market in the fall will preserve those arrangements for which 
parties have bargained, leaving just those consumers who have chosen to enter 
the market unhedged, and giving them seven or eight months to experience the 
operation of the market prior to the summer of 2002. 
This was a key consideration in the decision to open the New York market in 
November, 1999, rather than the spring of the following year. Remember that, 
although Ontario's demand traditionally peaks in the winter, we would expect 
prices to peak in the summer months. Moreover, because the summer is the 
period of peak demand across the Eastern interconnect as a whole, the summer 
months generally see relatively more operational/transmission related 
constraints than the winter. 
A fall opening will also enhance the efforts to ""decontrol"" or divest OPG 
assets. Those entities which might have an interest in acquiring OPG assets 
will, for valuation purposes, want to have as much information as possible 
about pricing in the Ontario market. Opening in the fall will give those 
entities a longer period of time over which to observe the way the 
price-setting mechanisms in the Ontario market actually operate. 
Accordingly, opening in the fall will help reduce uncertainty over the 
valuation of Ontario Power Generation assets. This would mean that the 
decontrol initiative will attract more potential buyers, and that those 
buyers will pay more than they otherwise would in the face of uncertainty. 
Focusing on getting the market open this fall will help maintain the 
commitment of those, like Enron, who have already devoted significant 
resources and capital to the market, while attracting more new players, 
sooner, into the province. 
The Ontario government should have confidence that the best way forward is to 
proceed with the implementation of that plan and with the opening of the 
Ontario wholesale and retail markets in the fall of 2001. The case for open 
markets is strong.

California lawmakers want windfall profits tax on energy companies 
Reuters News Service 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A coalition of California lawmakers Wednesday 
introduced a bill that would slap a windfall profits tax on power generators 
they claim have made a killing from the state's unfolding power crisis. 
""This says to the large generators who are gouging us that we are going to 
set a reasonable rate of return, and reasonable profits, and anything beyond 
that would be returned to the state of California,"" said Assembly member Dion 
Aroner. 
""They've been gouging us, and it is time to gouge them. We're sick of paying 
these outrageous bills to the Texans."" 
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, who has been scrambling to address his 
state's escalating energy emergency, said he would have no comment on the 
bill until it reached his desk. 
Aroner said the bill, proposed by a coalition of Democratic women, calls for 
the state to establish a formula to determine ""reasonable"" profits for 
generators and tax back anything over that amount. 
Major power generators, many of them based in Texas, have reported sharply 
higher earnings as wholesale power prices skyrocketed in the Western U.S. 
spot market. Last year at this time, prices were $30 to $40 per megawatt hour 
of electricity. This year, that same electricity costs between $300 and $400. 
Those high prices, combined with a botched 1996 state deregulation effort 
that kept caps on consumer rates, have pushed California's two largest 
utilities close to bankruptcy, forced the state into the energy-buying 
business and led to several days of rolling blackouts from San Diego to the 
Oregon border. 
Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Houston-based Reliant Energy, said any 
windfall profit tax was a terrible idea. 
""We would oppose any such form of legislation,"" Wheatley said. ""It does 
nothing to solve the fundamental problem that confronts California consumers 
-- namely, the lack of adequate power supplies."" 
Wheatley said the proposed tax also could exacerbate the situation by 
removing incentives for power producers to build plants and bring more power 
on line through investing in upgrades of aging facilities. 
Enron Corp. and other power sellers continued to reap the benefits of 
California's electricity shortage in the first quarter, with some bringing in 
record profits, analysts said Wednesday. 
Earnings at Houston-based Enron rose about 13 percent, analysts estimated. 






		

		
		

		
		SURVEY - SITE FEED - WORLD PULP AND PAPER: Online trading gets the cold 
shoulder The industry seems to be taking a cautious attitude towards the web 
Financial Times; Apr 5, 2001
By NICHOLAS GEORGE

		World Pulp and Paper survey 
		THE INTERNET by Nicholas George 
		It has been billed as the marriage of the old and new economies, but, so far, 
the union of the internet and the pulp and paper industry has been marked by 
suspicion rather than harmony. 
		Only 18 months ago, it seemed that newly-started dotcoms were stumbling over 
each other to set up online marketplaces, which, they claimed, would 
revolutionise the industry. Technologies and target groups differed slightly, 
but the message being preached was largely the same. 
		Buying and selling pulp and paper products had, for too long, been 
characterised by inefficiencies and high costs. 
		For an industry whose products have become global commodities, the internet 
could give the flexibility and price transparency producers and consumers 
deserve. 
		Yet, far from embracing the new breed of online marketplaces, the paper 
producers' reaction has ranged from caution to outright distrust. 
		According to Jorma Saarikorpi, head of e-business at papermaker UPM-Kymmene, 
neither customers nor producers have much to gain from third party 
marketplaces. Moreover, the concept of an open marketplace is ill-suited to 
the businesses' structure. ""If you think about the customer relationships in 
the industry, it is big suppliers and big customers and the number of 
suppliers and customers are decreasing all the time,"" he says. 
		Such scepticism has made it tough going for the dotcoms, and some of the 
smaller projects, such as AccessPaper.com, have fallen by the wayside. 
		AccessPaper blamed its failure on boom conditions in the industry, which 
meant producers had no incentive to look for new sales channels. 
		""We are not synchronised with the market or the players in the market,"" says 
Michael Palm, a co-founder. ""At present, the current sales channels are 
screaming for products, and sales staff just do not want to hear of new 
channels."" 
		But even the bigger and better funded start-ups have had to adapt to the 
negative reaction of the industry. For example, the European-based PaperX.com 
now focuses much less on its marketplace functions and more on its ability to 
offer software solutions to forest product companies setting up their own 
sites. 
		Bengt Roselund, project leader of Papinet, the European industry's own 
internet initiative, says the marketplaces ""scared the producers away when 
they said they wanted a commission of 2-3 per cent on each trade. That is an 
enormous amount of money"". 
		He adds: ""The marketplaces realised they had done the wrong thing, but the 
damage was done and the industry does not trust them. That's a pity because 
the marketplaces could have played a role."" 
		Papinet was set up to standardise the terms used in electronic trading 
messages. 
		Although it was started in Europe, it is now attempting to create a more 
global standard. By doing so, it aims to cut the cost and complexity of 
e-commerce. This is vital if e-commerce is to gain wide scale acceptance, 
says Mr Roselund. 
		In the US, the independent marketplace, PaperExchange, also has to compete 
against industry-backed rivals. However, Bob Brenner, chief executive, is 
convinced his company has a role. The problem, he believes, has been that the 
industry has misunderstood what the internet marketplaces are for. They are 
not an alternative for traditional long-term customer relationship, but a 
channel for a certain type of product or inventory, he says. 
		Mr Brenner points out that 10 per cent of pulp and paper sales are already 
being conducted on the spot market, a market that is often expensive for 
producers to use. 
		PaperExchange, which has now launched in Europe, had trading levels of nearly 
42,000 tonnes last year. 
		""Twelve months ago, people were experimenting, while six months ago they were 
using the site as a way to move extra product. Now, people are thinking of it 
as a channel for selling, or as a part of their sourcing strategy,"" says Mr 
Brenner. 
		Other companies also see the advantages of an internet market. Enron, which 
has been offering risk management products to the pulp, paper and wood 
industry since 1997, expanded its Clickpaper.com site to Europe in January. 
		So far, the industry has preferred to find its own solutions by modernising 
its existing electronic links with customers. Outsiders, in the form of 
third-party marketplaces, still have their work cut out to convince 
management they really do have a big role to play.

		COMPANIES & FINANCE UK: BG to get Pounds 51m from Enron NEWS DIGEST 
Financial Times; Apr 5, 2001
By DAVID BUCHAN

		BG to get Pounds 51m from Enron 
		BG, the gas group, said yesterday it would receive Pounds 51m from Enron's 
Teeside Gas subsidiary after the House of Lords ruled in its favour in a 
dispute over unpaid gas transit fees and interest. 
		The dispute centred on a 1990 contract by Teeside Gas to reserve capacity in 
the Central Area Transmission System, owned 51 per cent by BG. In 1993 the 
CATS pipeline was completed and Teeside Gas started making payments even 
though it had no need for capacity at that time. In 1995 it stopped payments 
and reclaimed past payments, at which the owners of CATS - chiefly BG, BP 
Amoco and Amerada Hess - took it to court. 
		The UK court of appeal ruled in Teeside's favour in 1999, but this was 
yesterday overturned by the House of Lords. BG's share of the House of Lords 
award will be Pounds 34m in back-payment, plus Pounds 17m in interest. David

		COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Duke outlines its Dollars 1bn Europe plan 
Financial Times; Apr 5, 2001
By MATTHEW JONES

		Duke Energy, the US power and gas group, is aiming to spend up to Dollars 1bn 
this year on European generation assets. 
		The plans, outlined by the company yesterday, are part of a group-wide 
strategy to move into deregulating energy markets. They mark a relatively 
late entrance into Europe compared with other US energy companies such as 
Enron. 
		Bruce Williamson, president of Duke Energy International, said the group was 
looking to secure between 1,000MW and 2,000MW of generation capacity to 
underpin a large increase in its electricity trading. The company plans to do 
this either by entering into long-term agreements with generators or by 
buying flexible coal or gas-fired power stations. 
		""Our aim is to spend between Dollars 500m and Dollars 1bn in Europe in the 
next 12 months,"" he said. 
		Duke is one of the largest US power generators and energy traders with assets 
worth Dollars 58bn and a market capitalisation of Dollars 28bn. 
		It currently trades natural gas in the UK, Belgium, Germany and the 
Netherlands but only trades electricity in Italy. 
		Mr Williamson said the group wanted to extend its power trading activities 
across all five countries and was talking seriously to ""between five and a 
dozen"" companies about generation plant deals. 
		Its first move would be in the UK, where it would aim to secure at least 
500MW by the middle of the year. Analysts cited TXU, Edison Mission Energy 
and Innogy as possible sellers of plant. 
		Duke is focusing the rest of its international expansion on Australia, New 
Zealand and Brazil. The group is aiming to double its investment in these 
countries in the next two to three years, representing a total spend of about 
Dollars 3bn. www.ft.com/utilities

UK: UPDATE 1-Britain gears up for offshore wind power.
By Andrew Callus

04/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Britain cleared the way on Thursday for a 1.6 
billion pound ($2.3 billion) offshore wind power investment, the first large 
scale British attempt to tap the clean energy source. 
Built around the windswept UK coastline, 540 sets of blades spinning more 
than 100 metres above the waves should be supplying one percent of Britain's 
energy needs by 2004-2005. The Crown Estate, manager of land and territorial 
waters owned by Britain's Queen, said it was issuing seabed leases to 18 
companies at 13 sites that will produce between 1,000 and 1,500 megawatts of 
power altogether.
The set of projects goes one tenth of the way towards a government plan to 
see 10 percent of the UK's energy needs produced from renewable sources by 
2010, according to the British Wind Energy Association (BWEA), which 
represents most of the businesses involved. 
Offshore wind is more expensive to tap than onshore, but local resistance to 
noise and to the sight of tall land-based turbines has made it an option 
worth exploring. 
The BWEA believes wind energy blowing across the seas around Britain could 
supply its electricity needs three times over, and says wind power onshore 
and offshore already competes effectively with alternatives at between 1.9 
and 3.0 pence per kilowatt hour compared with 1.8-2.2 pence for gas. 
""We don't need subsidies any more. We are price competitive,"" said a 
spokeswoman for the BWEA. 
The association already backs a pilot offshore wind project at Blyth on 
England's northeast coast that began delivering electricity in December last 
year. 
Companies involved in the projects still have to obtain planning permission 
from the government and other planning bodies, and must gain all consents 
within three years or lose their lease. 
But the UK Department of Trade and Industry aims to set up a ""one-stop shop"" 
to help them through other planning hurdles. Developers include global energy 
names like Enron and Royal Dutch/Shell , British power and construction 
companies Powergen and AMEC , and smaller specialist companies. 
In all, 540 high-tech windmills producing three megawatts of power each will 
be installed in groups of 30, with the nearest turbine of each sited between 
1.5 and 10 kilometres offshore. 
More than half will be positioned in the Irish Sea along England's northwest 
coast between Liverpool and the Scottish border. 
Others will spring up on the east coast off East Anglia and in the mouth of 
the Thames estuary, further north at Teesside, and in the coastal waters of 
south Wales in the Severn estuary. 
Environmental groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth backed the plan, but 
urged the government to catch up with countries like Denmark, where the wind 
industry already employs 14,000 people. 
""After thirty years of opposing industrial abuse of our seas, Greenpeace can 
at last welcome a move to exploit the fantastic renewable energy resources 
off our coastline,"" said Matthew Spencer, head of Greenpeace's Climate 
Campaign. 
""Let's hope this signals a new commitment to developing Britain's renewable 
energy industry,"" he said.

INDIA: Enron issues arbitration notice to India govt.

04/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, April 5 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of Enron Corp has issued a notice 
of arbitration to the Indian government to try to recover 1.02 billion rupees 
($21.88 million) it says is owed for supplying power to the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board (MSEB). 
The notice means the dispute will be taken to the Court of Arbitration in 
London.
MSEB wanted the power bill offset against a four billion rupee fine it levied 
on Enron's controversial Dabhol Power Co for what it said was the non-supply 
of power for intermittent periods between October and the end of January. 
The Indian government asked the two companies to sort out the dispute before 
it would consider covering any of the payment from central coffers. 
Government officials could not be reached for comment. 
""We strongly believe that the federal government's position is in direct 
conflict with the power purchase agreement as was explained to them in legal 
opinions,"" a Dabhol statement said. 
""This step was necessary in order to preserve our rights in the project, and 
to ensure that all parties honour their existing contractual obligations,"" 
Dabhol said. 
The move heightens the confrontation between Enron and India and threatens to 
further damage the country's efforts to attract foreign investment in the 
power sector. 
Dabhol's 2,184 megawatt power station is the biggest power investment in 
India. Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees per kilowatt hour for its 
power versus 1.5 rupees charged by other suppliers. 
Dabhol originally sought payment of the 1.02 billion rupees from the 
government in March. The payment covered the supply of electricity during 
December. 
The payment was due from MSEB on January 25 and was the latest default from 
the state electricity board. 
Under a 1996 counter guarantee agreement, the federal government is obliged 
to pay Enron when MSEB defaults. 
Enron invoked the counter guarantee for the first time to cover payment of 
790 million rupees for electricity supply in November. The amount was later 
paid by the Maharashtra state government. 
($=46.6 Indian rupees).

Law Lords order Enron to pay pounds 100m over pipeline

ENRON, the American oil company, was yesterday forced to pay out around 
pounds 100m to the shareholders in a North Sea pipeline, led by BG, after the 
House of Lords overturned a previous Court of Appeal decision over 
transportation payments. 
The dispute between Enron and shareholders in the Central Area Transmission 
Systems (CATS) dates back to 1995, when Enron's Teesside Gas Transportation 
subsidiary stopped payments to the pipeline, which transports gas from 
central North Sea fields.
Enron's Teesside subsidiary had previously signed an agreement with the CATS 
shareholders for certain pipeline transportation rights. 
The CATS shareholders claimed payments were due once the pipeline was 
completed, but Enron claimed that CATS was not available for use. 
BG will receive around pounds 35m plus pounds 17m in interest, in line with 
its 51.18pc stake in CATS. 
BG declined to comment, while Enron expressed its ""disappointment"" but said 
that the payment ""would not materially impact earnings"".

Merger Increases Value of King of Prussia, Pa., Video-Conferencing Company
Patricia Horn

KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: The Philadelphia Inquirer - 
Pennsylvania
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM)

V-Span Inc., a King of Prussia provider of video-conferencing services, has 
reached an agreement to acquire Peer Digital Inc., of Boulder, Colo., in a 
merger that the companies say will position V-Span as one of the industry's 
top companies. 
The companies expect the merger to close in two weeks. The headquarters will 
remain in King of Prussia.
The companies, both founded in 1995, declined to put a value on the 
stock-for-stock deal but said the combined company would have annual revenues 
of around $42 million. About two-thirds of that would come from V-Span, and 
one-third from Peer Digital. 
Elliot Gold, publisher of TeleSpan, a teleconferencing industry newsletter 
that predicted the merger last month, estimated that V-Span paid $20 million 
to $28 million for Peer Digital. 
The merger will allow the combined company to become profitable more quickly, 
J. Kenyon Hayward, V-Span's founder and chief executive officer, said. 
Executives for the two companies, however, declined to predict when the 
merged entity might gain profitability. 
V-Span said it raised $28 million last year from investors including Goldman 
Sachs & Co., Comcast Interactive Capital, Motorola Inc. and Enron Corp. 
The merger positions V-Span as one of the largest five companies in the world 
that sell video-conferencing from multiple locations, Gold said. The 
industry, while still small at around $250 million in annual sales, is 
growing by about 35 percent per year, he said. 
""I think [Peer Digital] started looking at the competition and realized ... 
they would be stronger"" if they merged, Gold said. ""Both were growing nicely, 
but V-Span was growing faster."" 
Peer Digital had struggled in sales but has superior teleconferencing 
infrastructure and technology, said Gold, while V-Span excelled at sales but 
""was having a problem with the infrastructure."" 
The combined company would have about 325 employees. Executives would not 
comment on whether consolidation would lead to layoffs. 
""This is a growing business, and we expect to expand worldwide,"" said John D. 
Field, Peer Digital's chief executive, who will become V-Span's president. 
""We expect to see more offices added. 
""We all believe this is a great consolidation of a major piece of the 
industry,"" Field said. ""And we intend to be one of the leaders in 
consolidating this industry."" 
But Gold said V-Span could ""end up on the other end of the Pac-Man battle."" 
""There is consolidation in the industry on a global basis ... and there are 
several companies, such as Genesys Conferencing, that have been acquiring 
companies like mad,"" he said. ""I think there is a reasonable chance that 
V-Span will be acquired over time. They are positioning themselves to be 
acquired.""

Bandwidth Mkt: Price Adjustments Fail To Spur Action

04/04/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Bandwidth traders adjusted prices Wednesday trying to 
spur trades but didn't get any results. 
Prices moved higher for several contracts covering bandwidth this year in the 
eastern half of the country. Lower prices were quoted for one route this year 
in the western half of the country and for other contracts covering bandwidth 
next year.
For OC3 bandwidth between Seattle and Los Angeles for calendar year 2002, the 
bid was $.0015 a DS0 mile a month, down $.0005/DS0 mile/month from Tuesday's 
price. 
The offer on that contract moved higher for bandwidth delivered to Enron 
Corp. (ENE) pooling points and lower for bandwidth delivered to LighTrade 
pooling points, traders said. 
The offer was $.003/DSO mile/month for delivery to Enron pooling points, up 
$.0004/DS0 mile/month from Tuesday. 
The offer for delivery to LighTrade Inc. pooling points fell to $.0021/DS0 
mile/month, down $.0005/DSO mile/month from Tuesday. 
The variations were based on differing views held by market-makers using the 
pooling points. 
One trader attributed the lack of buyers in the West to falling prices. 
""Everybody thinks the price is going to go down and nobody wants to be long,"" 
he said. 
Another trader agreed that prices are expected to fall, but rejected the idea 
buyers fear being stuck with over-priced capacity. 
In Eastern markets, prices generally rose Wednesday for contracts with 
delivery dates this year. Those increases were seen in the New 
York-Washington, D.C.; New York-Chicago and New York-Dallas markets. 
Sellers are seeking higher prices because buyers are running out of time to 
get deals done on contracts that include bandwidth for June. There's less 
than two months left for provisioning circuits for June. 
In most of those same markets, prices fell on contracts with delivery dates 
in calendar year 2002. 
The exception was the market for OC3 bandwidth for calendar year 2002 between 
New York and Washington, D.C. The bid remained at $.0021/DS0 mile/month while 
the offer moved to $.0047/DS0 mile/month, up $.0015/DS0 mile/month.

 State reviews draft plan to prohibit energy exports 
Published Sunday, March 11, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY STEVE JOHNSON 

Mercury News 


To the concern of some of its neighbors, California appears to be getting 
more serious about the idea of banning its electricity generators from 
selling to other states on days when power supplies here are critically short.

A draft proposal to prohibit such exports was circulated late last week by 
the California Independent System Operator, which oversees most of the 
state's power grid. Although officials there could not be reached for 
comment, the proposal said the agency plans to seek approval for the ban from 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which supervises power wholesalers.

The proposal would require California generators ``to make full capacity 
available'' to this state when electricity reserves dip below 7 percent, a 
condition that results in a Stage 1 emergency. Rolling blackouts can result 
after a Stage 3 emergency, when reserves fall below 1.5 percent.

Gov. Gray Davis and other California officials have been mulling over the 
idea of such a ban for months. They are concerned about California's power 
being shipped elsewhere, particularly when the state is scrambling to find 
enough electricity to keep the lights on.

A Mercury News analysis in December found that thousands of 
California-generated megawatts -- enough to supply several million homes -- 
were routinely being sold to other states during hours when power here was 
critically short.

In addition, the draft proposal said banning exports could help prevent 
generators from engaging in ``megawatt laundering,'' in which they 
artificially inflate the price of their power by selling it out of state to 
an affiliate or an associate and then back into California just before it is 
needed. While in-state power suppliers are somewhat limited in what they can 
charge, no such constraints apply to power sold into California during 
electrical emergencies.

But because California is highly dependent on electricity imports, some 
experts fear that banning energy exports could backfire. They said other 
states that periodically rely on power from California might retaliate by 
barring their generators from selling power to the state.

``Steps that would essentially Balkanize the intertie could be 
counterproductive,'' said David Danner, energy policy adviser to Washington 
Gov. Gary Locke, in reference to the major high-voltage line known as the 
intertie that links California to the Pacific Northwest.

Danner praised Davis' recent efforts to solve California's energy problems. 
Even so, he said, any restriction on the flow of electricity could provoke 
anger in Washington state, where record-low rainfall has hurt the ability of 
the region's hydroelectric dams to make power and where some residents have 
seen their utility bills soar.

``I get calls every day from people . . . who say, `Why should I sit in the 
dark when all the power gets shipped to California?' '' said Danner, noting 
that Washington residents have been asked to drastically cut back on their 
electricity this year. ``There is some resentment.''

Roy Hemmingway, an energy specialist in the office of Oregon Gov. John 
Kitzhaber, expressed concern that the proposed ban would hinder what he 
called ``the mutually advantageous exchange of power between the Pacific 
Northwest and California.

``We in Oregon are pretty sympathetic to the extremely difficult situation 
that California is facing,'' he said. Even so, he added, ``I am hoping this 
proposal would have some flexibility in it.''

688,"Jeff, I am too simple to understand this!  What does removing the direct 
access language do? I do not recognise the document from which it was removed 
, hence I do not know whether this is bad or good for Enron! However from 
your last statement - ' has no proposal before it implementing the 
prohibition' - I am interpreting   that the implementation of the  Direct 
Access prohibition is no longer on anyones agenda so that would be good for 
Enron. 
Hope you are still having fun! 
Kathryn  



The Commission just voted out one half of the ""Bilas Alternate.""

The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating 
that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass 
through DWR costs to customers.
However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the 
Bilas language on Direct Access.  The decision therefore did NOT include the 
Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct 
Access prohibition.  Carl Wood called including Direct Access ""the height of 
arrogance.""  
The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting.
That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the 
prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the 
prohibition any time soon.

Best,
Jeff

Calpine appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed amendments to
AB 1X.  The proposed amendment would delete language now in section 80110
which provides:  ""The department shall have the same rights with respect to
the payment by retail end use customers for power sold by the department as
do providers of power to such customers.""

That language is extremely useful for maintaining that the department may
directly bill customers if, for example, the CPUC does not adopt a
sufficient rate recovery mechanism.   It is very important to use that we
keep that language intact.  I don't believe this should be a problem for any

701,"Hello everyone.

First let me say how much I enjoyed meeting and working with you last
Saturday. I know how busy all of your lives are.  I appreciate the energy
you put into a long, beautiful weekend day you might have spent playing
with family and friends.  Thank you for the commitment you brought to the
entire day.  I appreciated the number and quality of questions, and your
engagement in class discussions.  I look forward to working with you again
next class, and beyond.

The remainder of this message concerns the impromptu exercise you will do
the morning of February 24, as well as a few reminders.  The message is
relatively long, so you might want to save or print it and read it when you
have time.

Before I get to our impromptu exercise for next week, I want to make a few
comments about impromptu speaking.  People give many more impromptu-type
speeches in their lifetimes than prepared speeches.  To cite one
researcher, Rick Isaacson states in his book, ""Fundamentals of Impromptu
Speaking,"" that the average person gives more than 20 impromptu speeches
for every prepared speech.  That ratio is too high for many of you who give
business presentations regularly, but even you will give more ""off the
cuff"" speeches than prepared ones.  Being effective in impromptu speaking
also helps you organize and deliver answers to surprise questions you may
receive from superiors, clients, and others.  You chose a good exercise.

Now, a few words about topics.  Bring at least five, more if you feel like
it.  Remember to put them on individual slips of paper.  I plan to bring a
few myself, just to be sure we have a good assortment.

You might want to write one question or topic in each of five different
areas.  For instance, a standard business topic, like bank mergers, social
responsibility issues, or the business future of the Pacific Rim; a Haas
topic, like requirements, the availability of electives, or costs; a Bay
Area topic, like traffic, the environment, or bridge retrofits; a social
topic, like welfare, education, or abortion; a political issue, like
campaign reform, taxes, or immigration; etc. etc.  You might even want to
include a light topic, such as entertainment (perhaps asking what the Bay
Area's best restaurant is, or who will win the Academy Awards, or what rock
band is best).  Or brainstorm and come up with five from a similar area.
Just remember that you will be speaking on topics others give you, so be
kind.

You could just state the topic and let the speaker focus the speech, or you
could pose it as a question, such as: Should U.S. organizations offer
better family leave benefits?  Topics are OK, because they allow the
speaker to completely determine his or her own approach, though a question
helps the speaker focus.

We will break into four groups.  Each person will select three topics from
a ""hat,"" and will choose one to speak on.  Generally with this type of
exercise, it is good to give the speaker a minute to think about the
speech, though many people choose not to take the entire minute.  Then the
speech itself should be 1 - 3 minutes - we will make the time limit more
specific on Feb. 24.

After each speech you will coach each other by providing constructive
critical feedback.  We should have time for everyone to give at least two
impromptu speeches.

I also want to say a few things about the final speech session in the
afternoon.  We will do eight speeches. take a break, do eight more, take
another break, and finish with eight speeches and course evaluations. We
will have a short coaching session after each speech, including comments
from me.

Also, please remember that I plan to start class right at nine, to give us
as much time for the impromptu exercise as possible, as well as to have
time for the opening exercise (which is a quick nonverbal game that is fun,
invigorating, and educational).  We also will spend a little time
discussing the articles I gave you.  For the most part, I want you to use
those articles to help you revise your prepared speeches, though the
articles also contain ideas we may want to discuss.

Finally, remember your blank video tapes!  I really do want you to contact
me after our second session.  This class is too short to devote enough time
to my fully commenting on your speaking abilities.  If you bring a video
tape on the 24th, we will video your final speech and we can go over the
video together at some later time convenient to you and me.  Even if you
choose not to video, we can still meet to discuss your final speech and
other exercises.  I want you to know that I am also available for other
communication advice after the completion of our class.

I look forward to seeing and working with you all on Saturday, February 24.
I will send you a short reminder to bring your topics and blank tape closer
to class day.

Analysts Scrutinize Other Strategies

Here=0F's a look at analysts=0F' take on how the other largest carriers did=

those won by its =0F""designated entity=0F"" (DE), or small-business, partner=
 Alaska=20
Native Wireless, which bid $2.8 billion for 44 licenses.

Through that alliance, analysts note, AT&T Wireless gained spectrum in Los=

Angeles and New York, bringing its holdings to 45 MHz in those markets.  It=
=20
also added licenses in other major markets.

AT&T Wireless told analysts last week that the additional spectrum would=20

CINGULAR WIRELESS:  The carrier has 85% equity in DE Salmon PCS LLC, the=20

It also won licenses that could shore up Cingular=0F's spectrum position in=

Bureau OKs Satellite Operators For Intersatellite Communications

The FCC=0F's International Bureau has modified the licenses of 10 operators=

FCC Delays 700 MHz Auction Again at Request of Industry

Large carriers had supported in comments Verizon Wireless=0F' request for a=

Aerial v. Underground Facilities Is Topic of City-CLEC Debate

Municipalities and competitive local exchange carriers sparred last week ov=

whether the FCC should preempt several Ohio cities=0F' authority over the=
=20
placement of telecommunications facilities.

Their debate centered on one question:  Does requiring a competitive local=

aerial facilities where the incumbent=0F's facilities are located, constitu=
te =0F""

Predictably, the two sides split on the issue.  CLECs said that subjecting=
=20
them to different requirements from those faced by incumbent local exchange=
=20
carriers constituted discrimination and created a =0F""barrier to market ent=

CLECs Tout Effect on Economy But Seek Help from Congress

Competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) have played a major role in=20
fueling the economic growth of the last decade, according to a new study by=

the Association for Local Telecommunications Services (ALTS).

Still, Congress should consider legislation to help CLECs overcome the=20

to address its complaints about ILECs are the following:

(1) Separate ILECs into wholesale and retail units;

(2) Allow the FCC to impose steeper penalties for violating pro-competitive=

ALTS also takes aim at municipalities, which it says have caused =0F""excess=

(2) Require franchise fees to be based on the actual costs of managing the=

(3) Bar cities from imposing =0F""unreasonable=0F"" telecom and universal ser=

requirements on telecom carriers;

(4) Ensure that carriers have a private right of action in the courts to=20
enforce the rights-of-way provisions in section 253 of the 1996 Act; and

(5) Establish a process for obtaining rights-of-way across areas under=20

The study acknowledges that CLECs face =0F""financial impediments=0F"" to ful=

Court Upholds FCC Rules Giving ILECs Road to Pricing Flexibility

The case centered on the FCC=0F's 1999 pricing-flexibility order in Common=

ap=20
regime to gain greater flexibility in setting rates for interstate services=
=20
if they met certain competitive =0F""triggers=0F"" (TR, Aug. 9, 1999).

For example, ILECs can win relief from some pricing rules if the FCC finds=

 Per your request, I have prepared the following summary.

Western RTO Development:

RTO West.
Area to be included -- WA, OR, ID, MT, Western WY, UT, NV-North & South and 
hopefully Canada (BC Hydro and possibly Alberta)
Filed with FERC ""Stage 1"" documents in October 2000 -- Governance, Bylaws, 
Draft of Operating Agreement, etc.
Stage 2 development begun January 2001 with of complete proposal in July 2001
Earliest practical operation Fall 2002 (optimistic based on quick on approval 
time)
Plan Quality -- Good overall 
Attractive Features -- independent board, single control area and real time 
voluntary energy market, all parties on same tariff, a tradeable transmission 
right with ""use or lose"" anti-hoarding provisions.
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to 
existing users for a ten year period (""use or lose"" will mitigate for short 
term rights but long term rights on existing system will be tough to get).
Desert STAR.
Area to be included -- AZ, NM, CO, Eastern WY
Governance established and Board has been organized.
Have not yet filed a complete plan 
Earliest practical operation Winter 2002 or beyond, depending on when they 
actually file their proposal
Plan quality --  Potentially promising
Attractive Features -- similar transmission right regime as RTO West
Unknown -- whether they will have a single control area, whether 
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to 
existing users, board selection committee was manipulated by publics (however 
in practice the independent board selected seems to have been little affected 
by the search firm nomination process)
CA-ISO.
Area included -- CA IOU's only
Fully operational but with CA/FERC jurisdictional struggle over Board 
appointment and independence.
Modifications to meet Order 2000 have been filed which appear to move 
transmission rights close to the proposals under discussion in RTO West and 
Desert STAR


Cooperative Regional Organization Activity:

Seams.
A joint task force of parties involved in RTO West, Desert STAR and CA-ISO 
began meeting in November 2000
Three major seams issues identified and work begun
Scheduling time lines -- aligning processes between three RTOs so that 
business across seams boundaries is not hampered for administrative reasons.
Nature of transmission rights and effect on loop flow -- making the 
congestion management systems work between the three RTOs.
Export fees -- goal is to eliminate pancaking of fixed cost charges between 
RTOs, perhaps by annual transfer payments between RTOs or some other 
reciprocity agreement.
RTG Consolidation.  
WRTA. SWRTA and WSCC voted to merge in to a single organization, the WIO 
(Western Interconnection Organization)
WIO will have three committee:   Planning, Operations, Market Interface.  
The Northwest organization (NRTA) has decided to stay independent for now, 
but if RTO West forms it may just disappear as a separate organization. 

If you need more detail, please let me know.

I realize  it is too late for changes and I support the Manifesto as is.
However, for the record I like to point out that the list of stakeholders
that must come to new arrangements (bottom of page 5) should have included
the utilititie's holding companies that siphoned the CTC funds out of the
state to purchase generation assets in other parts of the country. Given
that the stranded costs are way below what was predicted they should share
some of the pain by refunding at least a portion of the CTC collection.

Dow Jones Electricity Indexes, specifically their NP15/SP15 indexes.
- the indexes are based on weighted average prices and total volumes
- they measure ""bilateral one-day prescheduled, financially firm transactions""
=> therefore the Dow Jones Index more accurately reflects market pricing
- Dow Jones has the right to randomly audit the data providers

why not the ex-post ISO?
- generators are not selling to California's ISO because of the $150/MWh 
price cap,
=> therefore prices coming out of the ISO do not reflect real market prices
- if generators are not selling into the market, there is no liquidity, 
therefore prices are not reflective of the prices that buyers must pay

why not use the ex-post ISO price on an interim basis?

the divestment of assets in the oligopolistic generation sector, now

727,"Jeff, we need to add some discussion focused on QF issues in California and 
how resolution to certain items would enhance QF ownership and provide the 
utilities with optimal performance of the QF's and perhaps encourage new 
capacity development at existing QF locations.


The utilities should be motivated to enter into buyout, buydown, blend and 
extend, negotiate fixed energy prices and other restructuring transactions 
with the QF's.
The utilites have the ability to hedge the floating price currently being 
paid to the QF's.  They should be motivated to look into these structures.
Utilities should provide some clarification to the energy prices under QF 
PPA's.  There is alot of risks around SRAC and PX that affect both the 
utilities and the QF owners.  It seems like resolution to that risk is 
beneficial to both the utility as well as the QF.
QF's should have the ability to move excess capacity and energy into either 
the market and/or to the utility.  That  would create additional economic 
incentives for the QF's to run and perhaps increase their capacity.

As I mentioned in the meeting today: I would add:
Utility solvency problems are not as pressing as they make them out to be.  
Assuming that they  own 10,000 MW of generation with book costs of $50/MWh.  
Assuming that the 2001 power costs are $150/MWh alone, would allow an 
increase in the value of these assets by $13billion dollars.      The 
government could offer to take over the assets today for about $22b (2001, 
2002, and original estimated value), leaving the utilities with enough money 
to pay for existing debt plus whatever debt they are likely to incurr to the 
end of 2001.  They are trying to steal this value by threatening bancruptcy.",Lay Davis,50 150 $13billion dollars about $22b,

California Consumer Groups Seek Rate Protection Electricity: Activists push 
legislators to promise that customers won't be forced to cover rising 
wholesale costs.

Consumer activists on Tuesday blasted increasingly aggressive strategies by 
Southern California Edison and the state's other big utilities to recover 
their mounting wholesale electricity costs and called for lawmakers to 
promise that ratepayers won't bear the brunt of such costs. 
Three consumer groups unveiled a ""ratepayer protection pledge"" at news 
conferences in Santa Monica, San Diego and San Francisco that will be sent to 
all California lawmakers and candidates for the Legislature. 
""The politicians and utilities got us into this mess by promising lower rates 
with a plan that has failed miserably,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, president of 
the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
""Californians do not want any more lip service about consumer protection and 
lower rates. This time we want it in writing."" 
Edison International unit SCE, meanwhile, said it wants to develop measures 
to help customers manage the higher costs that have zapped the California 
electricity world this summer. 
Currently, residential and small-business customers of SCE and PG&E Corp.'s 
Pacific Gas & Electric utility are paying rates that were frozen by the 1996 
law that deregulated the state's electricity industry. Those rates will 
remain frozen until March 31, 2002, or until the utilities pay off their 
""stranded assets""--investments such as nuclear plants that became 
uneconomical under deregulation. 
Customers of San Diego Gas & Electric, a Sempra Energy subsidiary that paid 
off its stranded assets more than a year ago, had their rates capped by the 
state Legislature in August after record wholesale electricity prices caused 
bills for the utility's 1.2 million customers to double and triple. 
The utilities are running up a huge tab of wholesale electricity costs--$5 
billion and growing--that they can't pass on to customers because of these 
freezes. Who will pay these costs--consumers, utilities and their 
shareholders, or a mixture of both--has not been determined. 
SCE on Tuesday, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said 
it has amassed enough credits through the pending sale of generating assets 
and the valuation of its hydroelectric properties to pay off its remaining 
$1.3 billion in stranded assets and thus qualify to have its rate freeze 
lifted. PG&E made a similar filing two weeks ago. 
SCE also said that the utility and its shareholders should not be on the hook 
for costs of delivering electricity to customers, currently totaling $2 
billion and growing, and that it soon will file with the California Public 
Utilities Commission for authority to recover these electricity 
""undercollections"" from customers when the rate freeze is lifted. 
The Rosemead-based utility will file a plan in the next few months detailing 
a ""rate stabilization"" plan for customers so that they won't be exposed to 
wild market fluctuations in electricity prices, said Jim Scilacci, SCE's 
chief financial officer. The utility would expect to establish new rates and 
expand an existing level-pay plan to smooth out any electricity charges it 
would be allowed to pass on to customers. 
But three consumer groups--Rosenfield's Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights, the Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union--criticized the 
utilities for wanting to back out of a deal that has allowed them to collect 
$14 billion so far in extra electricity and other transition costs since 
deregulation began in 1998. 
The groups said they will mail to all lawmakers and legislative candidates a 
pledge to oppose any legislation or other efforts to require ratepayers to 
pay the electricity costs that have built up during the rate freeze. The 
groups intend to keep a list of each politician's position on the pledge on 
the Internet at http://www.turn.org and http://www.consumerwatchdog.org.","NANCY RIVERA BROOKS

Long-Term Power Contracts Present Dilemma for Utilities Energy: They see 
risks in proposals by electricity- generating firms if wholesale rates were 
to drop significantly.

California electricity users just can't seem to buy a break. 
After a summer of sky-high wholesale prices that briefly socked the bill to 
consumers in San Diego, various power marketers have come forward with a deal 
for the state's big utilities: Sign long-term contracts for electricity, at 
one-third to one-half current prices, and everybody goes home happy. 
But utilities and independent power generators have yet to sign such 
bilateral contracts despite industry assurances that the deals could offer a 
way out of the state's continuing electricity crisis. 
The aversion of utilities to the contracts' risks, regulatory uncertainty and 
the unsettled energy market overall are cited as causing the stalemate. In 
any case, the standoff is yet another sign that the deregulated California 
electricity market isn't working as expected, with residents, small 
businesses and utility shareholders the ultimate losers. 
Power merchants, which complain that they have been cast as heavies and as 
market manipulators during the summer-long electricity crunch, say the 
contracts they have offered to utilities illustrate how they are putting 
""solutions on the table,"" as one executive put it, that so far have not been 
picked up. 
Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International, and PG&E Corp.'s 
Pacific Gas & Electric received permission from regulators last month to sign 
long-term contracts to buy energy directly from generators and bypass the 
California Power Exchange, where wholesale prices soared this summer on 
higher-than-expected demand and generation shortages throughout the West. 
San Diego Gas & Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy, got a green light to sign 
such bilateral ""forward"" contracts last week. The utility's 1.2 million 
customers suffered through a summer of doubled and tripled bills before price 
caps were enacted last month; retail prices in Edison and PG&E territory 
remain frozen under terms of the state's landmark 1996 regulation bill. 
Those limits on rates have saddled the utilities with $5 billion in 
uncollectable costs--the difference between the skyrocketing wholesale rates 
and the prices they can pass along to consumers. Doubts surrounding whether 
the utilities will recoup any of that growing deficit is causing increased 
nervousness on Wall Street. 
On Wednesday, Edison International shares plunged $3.19, or 14%, to $19.88 on 
the New York Stock Exchange in heavy trading, as investors focused on the 
risks the company faces in borrowing to cover power costs. The stock now has 
slumped 24% from its recent high. 
PG&E Corp. slid $1.92 to $25.39 on Wednesday, extending its loss to 20% from 
its recent high, also on concerns about its borrowing needs. 
After the state's Public Utilities Commission authorized bilateral contracts, 
power merchants including Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc. and Dynegy 
Inc. came forward, offering to supply power to the utilities at fractions of 
the going wholesale rate. 
The power merchants have been touting energy as cheap as $50 per 
megawatt-hour in contracts spread over one to five years. That would seem to 
offer big savings over the average Power Exchange electricity price so far 
this month of $122 per megawatt-hour and the $166 average for 
August--dramatic spikes upward from the $40 average of August 1999. 
Why, then, have no deals been cut? 
Edison and SDG&E say that the Public Utilities Commission's right of review 
would create huge potential liabilities for their shareholders if wholesale 
electricity prices were to fall. 
The risk is that prices on the Power Exchange could drop significantly 18 to 
24 months from now, when added generation capacity coming online in 
California should ease shortages. That could leave utilities paying more 
under contracts than on the open market. 
""The PUC could look at the transactions, find them to be imprudent, say the 
difference between the contract price and Power Exchange price was the cost 
of our actions, and then try to recover the difference from shareholders,"" 
said Kevin Cini, Southern California Edison's manager of energy supply and 
marketing. 
The PUC could possibly take such action any time the contract price turns out 
to be more than a 5% ""safe harbor band"" above the average Power Exchange 
wholesale price over the life of the contract. ""We think the safe harbor 
should be 20%,"" Cini said. 
A source at the PUC--some of whose members have been against bilateral 
contracts on grounds they distort the workings of the Power Exchange--said 
the utilities want a ""blank check"" to make deals and bypass the commission's 
mandated oversight role in setting retail electricity rates. 
""The utilities don't want any constraints on what they can do,"" said a PUC 
administrative source who asked not to be identified. ""They don't want the 
PUC to take a retroactive review and say this was unreasonable and disallow 
some costs, nor do they want pre-approval and be subjected to review."" 
Industry observers say that the PUC's right to review all contracts longer 
than two years hamstrings the utilities' ability to hedge their risks in the 
volatile state energy market. 
""The utilities can judge the risks. What we need is the PUC to allow the 
utilities to enter into these deals without the second chance of looking at 
them,"" said Greg Blue, senior director of Dynegy, a Houston-based power 
merchant that owns several power plants in Southern California. 
Regulators and consumer advocates, meanwhile, are concerned that allowing the 
utilities to sign contracts for supply represents a merchant role they 
relinquished under deregulation. 
Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer 
watchdog, said the utilities could someday lose some of their retail customer 
base, ""leaving the remaining customers to pay contracts costing more than 
what was available on the spot market."" 
Stanford professor Blake Johnson believes the California wholesale market 
will one day ""settle out"" as a mixture of short-term contracts on the Power 
Exchange and long-term bilateral deals. Until then, he said, he can see the 
risks on both sides of the issue. 
""When the house is on fire,"" he said, ""it's not the right time to buy the 
insurance policy.""

757,"Cal-ISO seeks forward contracting authority
  
09/20/2000 
Generation Week 
(c) Copyright 2000 Pasha Publications, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
The California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) ""most reluctantly"" asked 
FERC last week to approve tariff amendments that would allow the system 
operator to obtain forward contracts. 
Further, in an effort to discourage utilities from leaning on the ISO for 
power, The ISO wants to allocate the costs of those contracts to scheduling 
coordinators whose forward schedules do not reflect their actual real-time 
demands. The allocation of those costs would be proportional to the sizes of 
the deviations. This would be a change from the current system, in which 
energy purchasing to balance load is spread among all market participants. 
""Fairness, as well as providing appropriate economic incentives to scheduling 
coordinators to align their forward and real-time schedules, dictates this 
allocation,"" the Cal-ISO's filing states. 
Recently, Cal-ISO President and CEO Terry Winter had unsuccessfully sought 
approval from the ISO Board of Governors to approve an amendment to the ISO's 
tariff to require scheduling coordinators to include at least 90% of actual 
loads, with generation and imports sufficient to balance their schedules, in 
final day-ahead schedules, and 95% of actual load in final hour-ahead 
schedules. Scheduling coordinators would have had to bear the costs of the 
ISO's out-of-market power purchases to balance the load. Coordinators would 
have been allocated the costs of those arrangements in proportion to the 
deviations of their actual real-time loads from their scheduled loads (GW 
8/30). 
The ISO is asking for authority to enter into forward contracts without first 
soliciting bids because a formal bid process would take too long in a 
fast-moving market. 
FERC has directed the ISO to enter into forward contracts as a means of 
better assuring that load requirements are met. FERC expressed its concern in 
an order refusing San Diego Gas & Electric's request for a cap of indefinite 
duration on energy sold in the California Power Exchange. FERC ordered ""the 
ISO to immediately institute a more forward approach to procuring the 
resources necessary to reliably operate the grid."" 
The ISO said it is in total agreement with FERC's observation that a 
reasonable supply portfolio would make use of forward contracting as a hedge 
against price volatility. The ISO noted that the grid operator and FERC are 
in agreement that fulfillment of forward contracting is a responsibility that 
best resides with load-serving utilities. 
""Unfortunately, and for reasons not at all apparent to the ISO, the utilities 
thus far have been denied that authority,"" the Cal-ISO filing stated, noting 
the decision to empower the utilities rests California Public Utilities 
Commission. The ISO said it is applying for the tools to enter into forward 
contracts, but expressed hope that load-serving entities would ""receive and 
exercise the authority to discharge a responsibility that more properly is 
theirs."" 
The ISO said it doesn't want to be placed in the position as a competing 
market player. 
""The ISO continues to believe that its market activities should be 
constrained to an absolute minimum and that, most particularly, it should not 
be competing against load-serving entities for the energy needed to satisfy 
load that is reasonably predictable,"" the Cal-ISO said. 
The Cal-ISO wants forward contracting authority because the grid operator 
needs to buy increasing amounts of power at the last minute to balance supply 
and load on the grid. The ISO has been scrambling through real-time and 
ancillary services markets to find this balancing power. 
Originally, the California market system was set up so that utilities would 
buy most of the state's power needs through the California Power Exchange's 
(Cal-PX) day-ahead market. State regulators have not given utilities 
authority to do extensive forward contracting outside the Cal-PX, and 
utilities have been increasingly inclined to under schedule their actual 
needs in the Cal-PX and lean on the ISO to provide the balance of the power 
for their customers. 
Saying that underscheduling of load continues to be a problem and cautioning 
that unseasonably warm days occur in the fall, the ISO asked FERC to waive 
the typical 60-day notice required for tariff amendments and allow the 
changes to take effect immediately. 
""What the ISO seeks are the tools necessary to enable it to contract if 
available forward commitments appear reasonable,"" the system operator's 
filing says. The ISO said it does not believe other, related FERC orders 
require it to forward contract. ",Terry Winter,,"Cal-ISO Copyright 2000 Pasha Publications, The California Independent System Operator FERC ISO the ISO Board of Governors San Diego Gas & Electric's the California Power Exchange California Public Utilities

Figures show state lost big on extra power 
Posted at 9:53 p.m. PDT Monday, July 23, 2001 
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK 
Mercury News 
State figures show California may have lost about $14 million this month 
selling surplus electricity for less than it cost. 
The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a 
loss. But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much 
excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts -- 
and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be 
needed. 
A Republican lawmaker said Monday the loss also shows Democratic Gov. Gray 
Davis' energy policies are needlessly costing consumers. 
``This whole thing is a mess,'' said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, who 
requested details of the state's surplus power sales. ``The government needs 
to get out of the power business before it costs Californians even more 
money.'' 
A state spokesman didn't dispute the $14 million figure outright but said it 
is an approximation based on average prices and that the actual loss probably 
is less. 
``It's a number I'm sure he likes very much, but it's definitely an estimated 
number, and it could be far lower,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the 
state Department of Water Resources. 
Campbell responded that the loss also could be higher. 
The state has spent $415 million on power so far this month. 
State officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer 
conservation have left California holding more power than it needs. The 
revelation was a stunning turnaround for a state that months ago was paying 
top dollar for power, expecting shortages this summer. 
Price that was paid 
The state bought 3.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity for July at an 
average price of $118 per megawatt-hour, according to a response Friday by 
the Department of Water Resources to Campbell's inquiry. The state has sold 
178,000 surplus megawatt-hours in July at an average price of $37, the 
department said. 
Based on those average prices, the state paid $21 million for the surplus 
power, which it sold for $6.5 million -- $14.5 million less than it cost. 
A more precise calculation of the state's loss is difficult because purchased 
power is acquired at different times and prices and pooled as a 
``portfolio.'' 
Purchases included long-term contracts that averaged $138 per megawatt-hour 
as well as cheaper spot-market buys. 
State officials last week said they were selling surplus at $15 to $30 a 
megawatt-hour, while some traders cited unconfirmed sales as low as $1. 
Hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just 5 percent of California's 
July purchases, which totaled $415 million. The $6.5 million from sales will 
help lower the state's power bill, he said, adding that utilities routinely 
sell some extra electricity. 
``Despite the fact that we're in somewhat of a surplus, any power-buying 
operation in the world is going to have to plan for these types of 
situations,'' Hidalgo said. ``It's not unique, and in fact it's normal 
operating procedure for any utility.'' 
Other Western utilities, including Portland General Electric in Oregon, have 
said they, too, are selling some surplus power at a loss and describe it as a 
cost of doing business. 
The suppliers buying the state's surplus electricity on the cheap include the 
big out-of-state energy companies that the governor has called price-gouging 
``snakes.'' Among them are Duke Energy, Dynegy Power and Marketing, El Paso 
Power Services, Mirant, Reliant Energy and Williams Energy. 
`Best bid' taken 
Hidalgo said the state took the best offers it could find. 
``It's only reasonable to get the best bid you can,'' he said. 
Campbell said the $14 million loss is troubling because ratepayers or 
taxpayers will have to cover the cost, whereas a private utility could be 
forced to eat the expense if regulators determined it was unreasonable. 
State officials say what's more important is that the overall cost of power 
is dropping, from an average daily tab of $64 million in May to $25 million 
this month, in part because the state has so much power.

781,"Adding to Kristin's update, here's the summary of a meeting that just occured 
with Assembly leadership staff and industry on the Assembly's latest version 
of an ""Edison MOU"":

The Speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time, he would bet 
that the Assembly would not convene on Friday.
He also said that, if it doesn't happen on Friday, nothing will happen until 
they get back from recess on the 20th of August.
The Assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether 
they intend to move forward with a vote on Friday or recess.
From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership, it 
appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing.  The proposal:
Retains Direct Access (though they said that they are continuing to be 
pressured by the Treasurer, who wants DA suspended due to the bond issuance)
Places 80% of Edison's past debt with large customers (leaving 20% with small 
customers, which business customers or strenuously opposing).
Eliminates all references to any purchase, or option to purchase, Edison's 
transmission. (They said there simply ain't the votes to buy, or consider 
buying, Edison's transmission in the Assembly)
Maintains the Senate provision, which would pay the banks, pay the QFs, but 
place with Edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $1billion owed to 
suppliers. (Even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions.)
Creates a tradeable, renewable portfolio standard (conceptually similar to 
the one created in Texas).
The new bill is created by 1) amending SB78 and 2) gutting a different bill 
passed from the Senate to the Assembly, SB39, and replacing it with the new 
version of 82XX.  The two would go together to create the Assembly's newest 
proposal.
If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficult 
time getting the votes necessary to pass in the Senate, since the Senate has 
considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the Assembly 
version.
Will report back on whether the Assembly's going forward or adjourning for 
recess as soon as we hear.

797,"Davis' deadlines on energy much easier set than met
By Emily Bazar
Bee Staff Writer
(Published Feb. 23, 2001) 
Exactly one week ago, Gov. Gray Davis sounded hopeful, optimistic even, when 
he predicted that the state and its debt-ridden utilities would forge an 
agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom. 
Problem is, it won't work out that way. 
Negotiations between state officials and the investor-owned utilities have 
produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today. 
Davis' predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before. 
For weeks, he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that 
haven't been met. On deadline days, even when there's little substantive 
progress to report, Davis often holds news conferences anyway -- many of them 
on Friday afternoons after financial markets close. 
The Democratic governor's office scheduled an ""announcement"" for today in Los 
Angeles, even though one utility representative said agreement is far away. 
Davis' actions have fueled speculation that he's trying to force consensus by 
setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news, and tarnishing 
the state's credibility in the process. 
""I can't see how you would negotiate such a complex deal, like the purchase 
of the transmission grid, in such a short period of time. It doesn't seem 
realistic,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an 
association of wholesale generators. ""I guess the people I represent have 
turned it off. They have stopped listening. They hear it and say, 'OK, sure. 
Here's another photo op.' "" 
Last Friday, Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the 
utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities. 
""I believe we'll have agreement before next week is out, on exactly what 
should go in a piece of legislation,"" he said at the time. ""And hopefully, 
that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week."" 
Legislative veterans said his comments were ill-advised and unrealistic. 
Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., but no agrement was reached. 
""These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,"" said PG&E 
spokesman Ron Low. ""On some issues, we are very far away from agreement."" 
Sources said PG&E has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission 
lines, which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal. More progress 
was reported with the two other near-bankrupt companies -- San Diego Gas and 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison -- although sources said talks 
with them were far from concluded. 
Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for 
months: 
In November, the governor promised to present a comprehensive ""plan"" by Dec. 
1 to stave off a full-blown energy crisis, but ended up offering only a 
modest slate of proposals. 
Davis called Feb. 12 a ""drop dead"" date by which he hoped to cement a deal 
between lawmakers and the utilities. There's no deal yet. 
Davis told reporters that he and the state's legislative leaders would reach 
a ""consensus agreement"" on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday. 
It didn't happen; he made the announcement alone. 
Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton, 
said it's important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of 
politics is to delay. 
However, he cautioned against missing deadlines. 
""You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish, because 
the more that you establish and not meet, the more that begins to lose its 
value as a political tool,"" Panetta said. 
The governor can't continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing 
consequences, cautioned Steven Fetter, managing director of the Global Power 
Group at Fitch, a credit-rating agency based in New York. 
At some point, he warned, creditors and power suppliers may push the 
utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, which would trigger an official 
deadline that can't be ignored. The dispute would be tied up in court at a 
judge's discretion. 
""Eventually, there is going to be a real deadline,"" Fetter said. ""The problem 
is it's probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov. Davis. It's a 
deadline that will be set by the banks and the (electricity) suppliers."" 
In several cases when deadlines haven't been met, Davis has held a news 
conference regardless, unveiling little new information and scant detail. 
On Jan. 26, for instance, the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan 
to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated. 
One prong of the plan: ""Aggressively promote energy efficiency, conservation 
and demand reduction among consumers, businesses and public entities."" 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set 
deadlines because it's important to show that the state is making progress, 
particularly to Wall Street. 
He added that it's not the governor's fault the deadlines have been missed. 
""Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to 
foresee or have control over: court decisions, actions by creditors, weather, 
you name it,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor sets deadlines that continue to 
move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that."" 
Many of these announcements came after 2 p.m. on Fridays, triggering 
suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate 
the markets. 
Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is 
commonly used by politicians who don't want to send stocks soaring or 
tumbling by making an announcement, Panetta said. 
""You want people to evaluate what's happening so there isn't a panic reaction 
to a news flash going over the wire,"" he said. 
But market analysts say that ever since PG&E and Edison stocks plummeted in 
early January, the governor's statements haven't significantly affected their 
performance. 
""There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that 
I don't think it makes much of a difference,"" said Ed Schuller, a senior vice 
president for the full-service brokerage firm Sutro & Co. ""It's beyond that 
point now.""

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)

846,"Scouting Colorado

Colorado, playing the toughest schedule in the country, was winless in four
games before storming into College Station and ending the Aggies' 22-game
home winning streak, 26-19, last week.
And the Buffaloes get to play the host this week when Texas comes to
mile-high Boulder for a 2:30 p.m. game Saturday. It will not be televised.
""That sure got my attention,"" said Texas coach Mack Brown. ""College Station
is a tough place for the visiting team.""
Colorado coach Gary Barnett has had a tough year up to last week. The
Buffaloes opened the season with a 28-24 loss to Colorado State, then fell =
to
Southern Cal, 17-14. Next up was Washington and the Huskies prevailed, also
by a 17-14 score. Powerful Kansas State pulled away in the second half for =
a
44-21 victory.
After the K-State loss, Barnett threatened to strip the Buffalo decals off
his players' helmets if they didn't start playing better.
Barnett went with true freshman QB Craig Ochs  all the way against A&M, and
he came through big, hitting 15 of 25 passes for 239 yards and one touchdow=
n
and running 18 yards for another touchdown.
Sensational freshman RB Marcus Houston is out with an injury, but Cortlen
Johnson dented the tough Aggie defense for 99 yards and a touchdown Saturda=
y.
WRs Javon Green and Roman Hollowell are swift and productive and TE Daniel
Graham also is a threat.
Defensively, the Buffs are led by a trio of returning linebacker starters,
headed by Jashon Sykes.
The Buffs return five offensive and six defensive starters from a team that
went 7-5 last year in Barnett's first season at the helm.
For the Longhorns to win, the defense has to prove the Oklahoma game was a
one-time disaster and go back to playing smash-mouth defense. It also has t=
o
pressure Ochs into some freshman mistakes.
Offensively, the Horns have to come out with their best shots early. They
haven't scored an offensive TD all year and haven't moved the ball at all i=
n
some of their first quarters this season. Unless the offense plays better
than it has been playing, it will be tough to win this game.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Big 12 Roundup

Oklahoma travels to Manhattan Saturday to play Kansas State in a battle of
top 10 undefeated powers.
Texas also visits Colorado in a game that will have a major bearing on the
races in both divisions because both teams already have one league loss.
Oklahoma is the only team in the Southern Division without a league loss,
while Kansas State and Nebraska are the unbeaten teams in the North.

Recruiting Roundup

Texas still has 16 commitments and the Longhorns plan to sign 22 to 25
players, with several of the remaining spots going to defensive linemen.
Tommie Harris, the great DT from Killeen Ellison, is the No. 1 guy on UT's
wish list, with Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia, Cal., the only
other big defensive lineman who is seriously considering the Horns.
This is a bad year for the big guys in the middle, so Harris and Jakes are =
as
important as anyone remaining on the Longhorns' wish list.
Here's a list of the Horns' 16 early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, Livingston
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview
Running Back (2)
Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee
Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson
Linebacker (2)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison
Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson
Defensive Back (5)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.4, San Antonio Holmes
Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42, Tyler
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands
As you can see, the Longhorns are almost through recruiting offensive
linemen, running backs, linebackers and defensive backs.
They want to sign one QB, one TE, one or two WRs, Waco's great LB Derrick
Johnson (who had 30 tackles in his team's loss to power Tyler John Tyler
about 10 days ago) super safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple and any other gre=
at
prospect who wants to come.
They should be able to get a QB and TE, and they might get one WR, but
probably won't be able to get two.
They lead for both Johnson and Brandon.
If things fall like they appear to be developing, there will be at least fo=
ur
spots left for defensive linemen, and possibly more, depending on whether t=
he
coaches will sign 25 players.
But right now, it doesn't look like Texas will be able to sign a lot of top
defensive linemen because the only ones who are leaning the Longhorns' way
are Jakes, DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., DE Kevin Everett of Port
Arthur Jefferson (who might be better suited to playing TE).
Harris appears to be wide open.
If the Horns don't fill all their defensive line needs this recruiting
season, they should be able to next year because there is a much better gro=
up
of the big guys who are juniors this year.
RECRUITING NOTES: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch visited the Texas
practice Thursday and spent a lot of time after practice talking to head
coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis, but he said he isn't
ready to commit and wants to look around some more . . . The other QB Texas
is recruiting, Brent Rawls of Shreveport Evangel, visits Florida State this
weekend and says he might be ready to make a decision by next week. He also
has visited Texas and Purdue, and Purdue appears to have a slight lead base=
d
on his belief that he would have a chance to play quicker with the
Boilermakers. . . LB/DE Jonathan Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is bein=
g
recruited by most colleges, including UT, as a defensive end. Colleges are
wanting DEs with great speed as outside pass rusher and Jackson ran a 4.56 =
at
a summer camp. That is very fast for a 6-3, 230-pounder.

Olympic Gold

Current and former University of Texas  student-athletes and coaches

UT Women Get 2 More Stars

College basketball coaches love always try to recruit players with height,
quickness, ball-handling ability and a good shooting eye.
The trouble is that few players have all of those abilities.
But coach Jody Conradt, who already had two outstanding recruits with all
four of those traits, landed two more last week for the Texas women's
basketball team.
Kala Bowers of Woodward, Okla., and Jody Bell of Chestermere High School in
Calgary, Alberta, Canada, two 6-2 stars who are so versatile that they have
played point guard at times, are the latest additions to Conradt's recruiti=
ng
class.
Bowers is a national top 25 player who was one of just four high school
underclassmen to be invited to try out for the 2000 junior national team
She also considered Colorado, North Carolina, Stanford and Nebraska. She
averaged 15.8 points and 7.4 rebounds last season.
Her high school is 53-2 for the last two seasons, winning one Oklahoma stat=
e
title and finishing as the runner-up to the state champion the other season=
.
""Last year, our point guard got hurt, so Kala played point guard for us,""
Woodward coach Kim Kramer said. ""She's so versatile she can play any
position.""
Bell averaged 14.5 points and 11.4 rebounds for Chestermere High School in
Calgary. She was a member of the Canadian junior national team.
She considered only warm-weather schools and wound up  picking Texas over
Arizona State.
Chestermere coach Brian Utley said Bell ""is a 6-2 player who can handle the
ball like a guard, run the floor and shoot the three. She's an inside/outsi=
de
player with skills you normally don't see in a girl her size.""
""She has great all-around skills,"" he said. ""Texas got an outstanding playe=
r.
She really enjoyed her campus visit to Texas and really liked coach Conradt=
.
She said there were too many good things about Texas for her to go anywhere
else.""
Conradt also has commitments from forward Heather Schreiber, 6-2, of
Windthorst, the state's hottest prospect, and 5-11 forward CoCo Reed of
Houston Jersey Village.
Like Bowers and Bell, they  are fine ball handlers and shooters.
Schrieber and Bowers are both on at least one national top 25 list. Schrieb=

already joined, recruit a  Longhorn friend and get him or her to join.
There has never been a better time to join because this is the year the
Ex-Students Association is sponsoring a membership campaign to better serve
the university in many ways, including expansion of the scholarship program
that already funnels nearly $2 million annually to deserving students who
want a degree from the University of Texas.
Jim Boon, executive direction of the association, says all UT supporters ar=
e
welcome to join, not just those who attended or graduated from Texas.
""We're letting people know you don't have to be a UT graduate to join the
only organization that serves all of UT-Austin,"" Boon said. ""It's a matter =
of
pride that the country's largest university have the largest alumni
association""
""But even more importantly,"" he said, ""we couldn't continue to reward
outstanding professors, encourage excellent teachers in our public schools,
talk to legislators about improvements in higher education and provide all =
of
our other behind-the-scenes services without growing our membership.""
Boon pointed out that whille every UT graduate is a Texas Ex, not every UT

847,"DJ Texas Power Export Capacity Returns To Normal

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Southwestern Electric Power Co. confirmed Monday that a
breaker problem near the 600-megawatt eastern direct-current tie has been
repaired, allowing exports from Texas to return to normal.

The breaker problem, which began last month at the coal-fired Welsh plant
in
Cason, Texas, could have lasted all summer, the utility had warned the
Independent System Operator for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

The breaker problem had limited exports by 100 MW from Ercot into the
adjacent
Southwest Power Pool.

SWEPCO is a unit of American Electric Power (AEP).

The east DC tie connects the transmission network of TXU Electric and
SWEPCO.

The east DC tie is the larger of two devices in the state, which allow a
combined 800 MW of power to be imported or exported from Ercot to SPP.

Ercot's northern DC tie, which connects the West Texas Utilities Co.
system to
Public Service Co. of Oklahoma, is rated at 220 MW.

",,
850,"With the first round of RTO filings and responses complete, it is a good time 
to step back and review the highs and lows that occurred in 2000 and lay out 
our plan going into 2001. 

A. 2000 Key Facts --

1. FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS.

It does not appear that FERC (in its current form) will modify its standing 
policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let 1,000 
flowers bloom.  While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a 
different position, we have seen no signals that anything will change.  Faced 
with this policy, as the initial RTO filings made clear, almost all utilities 
are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic 
transmission assets.  Accordingly, most of the proposed RTOs do not remove 
the fundamental problem - the Native Load exception.

2. THE MIDWEST CAN'T MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST.

The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO.  The three big 
utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd, 
IP, and Ameren (probably 40% of total load in initial MISO).   Key problems 
for the MISO include (a) MISO's not-for-profit status (key IP claim), (b) 
parties interest in taking energy east (key ComEd need), and (c) fair 
retention of 3rd party wheeling revenues (Ameren want).    Meetings with 
regional stakeholders (public power, industrials, State PUCs) have been 
productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred 
option, however we await action from the FERC.  MISO is also telling everyone 
that can listen that if the big three pull out, it probably won't continue.  
While the MISO process is very open to the public (not so with the Alliance 
RTO), neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the 
details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met.

3. SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED - NOTHING.

Rather than take a major step forward, Southern and Grid South (SCANA, CP&L, 
Duke) have initially filed non-compliant RTOs.  Grid South does nothing to 
advance a market, much less provide transmission service in a 
non-discriminatory fashion.  In fact, Grid South simply takes the current 888 
OATT and ""combines"" the three utilities for wheeling through purposes.  

4. PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERC'S SHINING LIGHT.

PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was 
necessary (rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the ""right 
example"").  PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order 2000 in 
that filing.  PJM is also expanding.  So far, Allegheny Power and DQE have 
agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called 
PJM West.  In terms of market coordination, PJM has been publicly reluctant 
to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools (PJM, 
NYISO,  NE-ISO, and Ontario IMO).   The other pools are not getting very much 
accomplished in their efforts.  For example, NE-ISO has indicated that it 
won't have the Day-Ahead market ready until 2003 at the earliest.  

5. ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME.

ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail 
access (pilot program beginning next summer).  The rules are still being 
structured.  We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines don't 
overwhelm good market structure.   Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading 
our efforts and are very active.  

6. SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG

In a surprise move, the actions so far in Grid Florida, while certainly not 
perfect, appear to be moving in the right direction.  The FL PSC has gone 
from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right.  
Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during 
this Legislative session; Enron will be involved.

B. 2001 Steps - 

1. FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION.

FERC will have new leadership some time in early 2000 (if we can get a 
President).  Enron is developing a coordinated political plan (Capitol Hill, 
media, Administration, industry allies) to impress upon the next 
Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue 
to drive wholesale market reforms.  Without a stronger mandate, it may prove 
difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of 2001.  More importantly, it 
will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail 
wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight.  In those RTOs 
that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception, no 
amount of meetings or filings will change the parties.

2. COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK.

It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to 
ensure that Enron's objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs.  
The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to 
coordinate day-to-day activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no 
opportunity is missed.  This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs 
of the commercial teams.   We continue to have at least one person dedicated 
to each RTO market.

NYISO   -  Howard Fromer
NE-ISO  -  Dan Allegretti
IMO   - Aleck Dadson
PJM  - Tom Hoatson
MISO/Alliance - Jeff Brown / Dave Mangskau
Grid South - Tom Chapman / Joe Connor
Southern  - Joe Connor
Florida  - Dan Staines
SPP  - Ron McNamara
ERCOT  - Robin Kittel

Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out.  
Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June / July to also work on wholesale 
market issues.

3. PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS.

NE-ISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January 
15, 2001.  While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration 
matters, not much progress has been made to date.  Moving power between the 
pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling 
rules.  FERC is aware of these problems.  Again, FERC has not done anything 
to mandate compliance with Order 2000.  We have deployed an additional 
resource in Houston recently to help support Enron's involvement in the tight 
pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all 
developments as close to real-time as possible.

4. CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES.

The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for 
ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO.  We continue to 
advocate our agenda (to anyone that will listen).   This work is time 
consuming (much spent listening to ""junk"" from monopolist Transmission 
Owners) and detailed.  Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs 
initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our 
resources.

5. FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT e-trans.

Project e-trans has resulted in a new business consortium - 
etransconsortium.com.  This combination of APX, Cal PX, and Alstom ESCA has 
developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the ""market 
front-end"" for any RTO (e.g., day-ahead market, transmission exchange, 
etc.).  Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates 
our policy objectives.  We are now turning our attention to finding the right 
Grid Operator.  We are in discussions with National Grid, American 
Transmission Company, MISO, and PJM (although they may want to do something 
very similar).  The goal remains the same -- to have a fully functioning 
entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use 
this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action.  I will be taking 
a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in 2001.

6. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION 
DIVESTITURE

Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets 
through direct access and divestiture.  It will take (1) non-discriminatory 
transmission access, (2) retail choice, and (3) generation divestiture to 
enable a fully thriving wholesale market.  Of course, additional market 
openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California.

I hope this helps put some framework around our activities.  If anyone wants 
to discuss this in more detail, I'd be happy to meet individually or as a 
group.

Given the number of litigation issues, the Linklaters Dabhol team needs another senior lawyer to help lead various efforts (which I have advocated).  Christopher Walker has recommended that Greg Reid of Linklaters join the team.  I believe that Greg is currently head of Linklaters International Arbitration group.

I've spoken with Barry Hunsaker and Stephen Wallace regarding Greg.  Both had very favorable things to say about Greg:  Hard-working, detail-oriented, smart, etc.  Neither of them had any reservations about Greg although he apparently does have a sharp sense of humor (so I can see why he and Chris get along).

Greg would not handle the ""India side"" of the litigation efforts which would remain with Chris.  He would help with the ""London side"" and the lender enforcement side (to the extent that occurs outside India).  In any event, Chris would remain as the leader of the overall litigation effort and we will expect Chris to keep tabs on matters Greg is handling to ensure the overall coordination of the effort.

Let me know if you have any comments or objections to Greg's involvement.

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

I haven't seen or talked to you in a while.  It will be fun to
(potentially) work with you and Lorraine again -- I can at least treat you
guys to a couple of good lunches!

Next Friday will be fine for me.  I am out of town through Thursday, but
open all next Friday - so just let me know if something on the 9th would
work for ya'll -

I think there are five potential deal areas on the table:

1.  Restructure existing ECS deals (bisti, bloomfield, gallup-switch from
MTM to accrual, hubbard, WT1)
2.  Increase netback from Gallup demand management (up to $2MM/year);
possibly MTM the remaining balance?
3.  New ECS/EES deals
4.  RCM Project -- $20 MM to $100 MM guaranteed incremental cashflow and
earnings for GPG in 2002
5.  ETS Trading/Risk Management Project - use SCADA data for incremental
earnings creation through trading/risk management


See you then.

917,"The posting process as discussed below in Steve Kirks email is what we believe is the best way to handle the sale of any incremental Needles only capacity.  

 In regard to new generally available capacity, for example as a result of a ROFR contract not rolling over,  the capacity would be posted as generally available, and again, per the tariff we are not required to agree to amend a primary point.  We would suggest use of a posting/open season that follows the turnback capacity for sale with the parameters for bidding laid out, including the time period for which we are accepting bids.  If no acceptable bids are received, and a shipper asks to amend their primary point, the tariff provides the right to decline unless agreed.  However, if you have given a shipper the contractual right to change their primary point ie, request an available point, you will have to accept the request.   Hope this helps and concurs with our discussion today.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

Shippers can still contract via fax and in writing; however, they will now (I believe after this coming weekend) by able to do requests and contracting electronically.  This include capacity release.  There were a few minor changes in the shipper requests requirements, but I believe most of these were already occurring; we just updated the tariff language.

Bennett is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. The Vikings will observe him in practice before deciding how much he will play. He may share carries with Doug Chapman.

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/07/01
Taylor has been upgraded to questionable for this week's game. His condition will be assessed at practice before the Jaguars make a decision. He still appears to be a very risky start for Week Nine.

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/07/01
Alexander (ribs) is listed as questionable for this week's game. Larry Parker would likely start in his place if he can't play.

Plaxico Burress <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Burress is suffering from a shoulder injury but will start Sunday. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Amos Zereoue <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=133462&>, RB PIT - Free Agen! t ! Updated 11/07/01
Zereoue, still recovering from a shoulder injury is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He missed last week's game because of the injury. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/07/01
Bettis is listed as probable for Sunday's game but will start. He is suffering from a sore wrist. 

Tim Dwight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Dwight will miss Sunday's game with a collapsed lung. Reggie Jones will be the No. 3 receiver against Denver.
! Doug Flutie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12375&>, QB SD - Russell Updated 11/07/01
According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, Flutie (concussion) is expected to start against the Broncos. The veteran QB said he is feeling fine. ""I thought I felt great after the game, and I felt better this morning and I feel even better this afternoon; so, as far as I'm concerned, I'm fine,"" he said. He will be re-evaluated on Thursday, but the results are not expected to be of any consequence.

Freddie Mitchell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235231&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
According to published reports, Mitchell has moved past Na Brown and is now Philadelphia's No. 3 receiver. He will see an increase in playing time as a result, and might be worth picking up in deeper leagues. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/07/01
According to the Charlotte Observer, the MRI performed on Weinke's injured shoulder showed no serious damage. Carolina's medical staff has indicated that Weinke should be able to play on Sunday against St. Louis, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event.

Jim Harbaugh <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1030&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Harbaugh was signed by the Carolina Panthers on Tuesday. He'll serve as a backup to Chris Weinke, and won't have much value as a Fantasy player this season. 

Bill Gramatica <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235069&>, K ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/07/01
Gramatica suffered a dislocated shoulder last weekend against Philadelphia, but he isn't expected to miss any playing time. He'll kick wearing a shoulder harness to protect the injury, which shouldn't get in the way of his kicking duties. 

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/06/01
Brunell is dealing with a strained quadriceps and may miss practice on Wednesday. His status for Sunday's game against Cincinnati is uncertain at this time. 

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/06/01
According to Head Coach Jim Mora, there has been no new medical news on James' injured knee. He is questionable for Sunday's game against Miami at this point. 

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 11/06/01
Pathon (foot) hopes to be ready for Sunday's NFC East battle against Miami. The Colts' wideout has missed four games and is ! li! sted as questionable for the contest. 

Santana Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Moss (knee) will have his workload increased in practice this week. The rookie wideout will be listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Kansas City, but don't expect him to post big numbers even if he does play. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=29&>, DT TEN - Frank Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Tim Dwight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12340&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Dwight suffered a collapsed lung during Sunday's loss to Kansas City. He's expected to be released from the hospital on Tuesday, but there is no defintive timetable for his return to the filed. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 11/06/01
Faulk participated in p! ra! ctice on Monday and looked as though his knee was holding up very well. ""He's obviously been keeping in pretty good cardiovascular shape while he has rested the knee,"" coach Mike Martz told STLtoday.com. ""He looked fine out there today. We probably could have played him (Oct. 28 against New Orleans) but this is the best thing to do. He's in good shape."" If Faulk is on your Fantasy roster, be sure to get him into your starting lineup this week. 

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 11/06/01
According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Hasselbeck will start this weekend's game against Oakland. However, coach Mike Holmgren wouldn't dismiss the possibility of Trent Dilfer playing if Hasselbeck struggles in the game. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Buckhalter suffered a shoulder sprain during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is expected to participate in practice on Wednesday, however, and will be available for this weekend's game against Minnesota. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/06/01
Wheatley was inactive for Monday night's game against Denver due to a knee injury. The big tailback is day-to-day. 

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&rando! m=! 1591&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/06/01
Glenn has told the league that he is suffering from chronic depression, which is the reason for his recent problems with the New England Patriots. As for his status for this weekend's game against Buffalo, coach Bill Belichick told the Boston Globe that ""he (Glenn) will be questionable this week. He's making progress."" 

Travis Henry <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 11/06/01
Henry suffered a hip injury Sunday but is expected to play this week. He was able to practice. 

Dedr! ic! Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1711&> , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Ward (foot) has been cleared to practice this week. Ward said that his foot was improving, but didn't seem too confident that he would be available for this weekend's game against Indianapolis. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/06/01
Taylor, who missed his fifth consecutive game this weekend, looks as though he'll miss Sunday's game against Cincinnati. Taylor will go through some individual drills this week, but coach Tom Coughlin doesn't seem optimistic that he will be ready in time to play against the Bengals, saying that he expects Taylor to return ""at some point."" 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/e! li! nk?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Despite splitting a few snaps with Mike McMahon in the first half of Sunday's game against San Francisco, Batch is still Detroit's No. 1 quarterback. ""Charlie is the quarterback of this football team,"" Mornhinweg told the Detroit Free Press. ""I want to make that clear, and I made that clear to Charlie as well as Mike. But it is important in developing a quarterback to get him some time in a league game when the game is still on the line."" 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/06/01
Gary was declared inactive for Monday night's game against Oakland. Now that Terrell Davis is back in the starting lineup, Gary's Fantasy value is very minimal. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/06/01
Davis started Monday night's game against Oakland, and was impressive in his return from injury. T.D. rushed for 70 yards on 17 carries in the game, and will likely remain Denver's featured back for the remainder of the season barring another injury. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/06/01
Leaf will get his first start! a! s a member of the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday against Atlanta. He'll replace Clint Storner, who will now serve as Dallas No. 2 quarterback. Leaf looked decent in his short outing against the Giants, but he's not worth a roster spot on your Fantasy team at this point.

Gary was declared inactive for Monday night's game against Oakland. Now that Terrell Davis is back in the starting lineup, Gary's Fantasy value is very minimal. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1164&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/05/01
Hearst bruised his knee in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable for this week's game against the Saints. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1593&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/05/01
Schroeder missed his second consecutive game Sunday because of an ankle injury. However, he continues to make progress and should play this week, according to published reports. 

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=188183&>, Active RB Updated 11/05/01
Smith suffered a bruised shin Sunday. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. 

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/04/01
Mathis caught one pass for minus-two yards against the Patriots. He is definitely not performing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy reserve.

Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 11/04/01
Smith had a huge game against Tennessee, catching seven passes for 120 yards. He is one of the top receivers in Fantasy Football and worth starting on a weekly basis. 

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1859&>, Active WR Updated 11/04/01
Thrash caught four passes for 80 yards and two TDs at Arizona. Don't expect good numbers from Thrash every week, because he tends to disappear against more established defenses.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/02/01
Plummer has been very inconsistent this season, so starting him as a Fantasy player is always a gamble. He had a solid game against the Eagles on October 7, but we'd avoid using him this time around as Philly looks to avenge an early-season loss to the Cards. 

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 11/02/01
Favre threw only one TD pass and was intercepted three times in his first meeting with Tampa Bay this year. Expect slightly better numbers from him at home against the Buccaneers this week. Favre may throw more than one TD pass, but expect at least one interception as well.

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 10/28/01
Bruce left Sunday's game in the second quarter with a reported broken left pinky tip, but was able to return in the second half wearing a splint.

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 10/28/01
Dillon rushed 27 times for 184 yards and two TDs, and also caught three passes for 18 yards and a score. While he has been an inconsistent back for much of the season, Dillon can tear apart poor run defenses like Detroit's. He's still a reliable weekly Fantasy starter.

Dorsey Levens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1591&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

960,"Hi Bubba!

Lacy got her eye exam yesterday.  He said that she is very near sighted, but 
the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all.  That was a relief. She's been 
having headaches, so I was concerned. They probably have been from her blood 
sugars being out of control.  She is doing so much better now.  I have 
stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much 
better. She's acting a lot more like her old self now. A lot nicer to me.  I 
guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of Tiger Dolls was what was 
wrong with her.  She doesn't say the cruel things to me that she used to.  I 
knew something had to be wrong with her.  I thought surely I had not raised a 
child with such a mean spirit.  Anyway things are a lot better.

Tell Cole that Mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as Lacy's.  Let 
him call to tell me about it.  I hope he gets his teary eye ""fixed"".
Lacy's eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes.  
He couldn't believe her teeth are so perfect without braces. And she is so 
tanned, you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she 
smiles.  She has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next 
week.  We'll talk later about when we are coming to your house.I'm going to 
Longview to a singles retreat Sat.in case you call & I'm not there.  Will be

977,"Steve, 

I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 
2000.  Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.  But since 
our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where 
HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.  ENA then transports the 
gas to a delivery point.  If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an 
additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery 
point.  This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and 
completing the scheduling in reasonable time.  Plus, it just doesn't make 
sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as 
HPLC.  Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned.

Thanks for your help.

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance.

CEOs Speak on the Strategic Importance (or Lack Thereof) of Information
Technology in the Energy Industry
By: Jon T. Brock, Director, Strategic and Competitive Intelligence

Four CEOs participated in a panel entitled the ""CEO Mega Panel: View From
the Top"" at the 48th annual EEI/AGA Energy Information Technology Conferenc=
e
in Phoenix this week.  The moderator was Charles Bayless, former chairman,
president and CEO of Illinova.  The remaining three CEOs included: Keith
Stamm, CEO, Aquila Energy; Dr. Matthew Cordaro, president and CEO, Midwest
ISO; and James Pignatelli, chairman, president and CEO, UniSource Energy.


ANALYSIS:  This panel was diversified in a very interesting manner. The
conference organizers did a good job in getting a cross-section of the
energy industry in transition.  The trading organization specialist was
represented with Aquila, the ISO specialist was represented with the Midwes=
t
ISO, and the vertically integrated utility was represented with UniSource
Energy.  Each panelist was asked what role information technology (I/T)
played in their respective organization.  Their answers may surprise you.

Dr. Matthew Cordaro of the Midwest ISO went first.  Dr. Cordaro stressed
that I/T was very critical to the operation of an ISO, saying ""it is=20
essentially
the foundation of the ISO."" He mentioned that the Midwest ISO had started
from scratch and would have to be able to handle hundreds of thousands
of transactions every week in a real-time operation.  Among the=20
responsibilities
that the Midwest ISO is entrusted with are: monitoring the congestion on
the grid and taking appropriate action, preventing gaming through market
monitoring, settlement processing (who owes who what), and handling the
dispute process.

The Midwest ISO signed a contract with the Regional Transmission Organizati=
on
(RTO) Alliance on July 20 of this year to deliver an integrated control
center system (ICCS) that, when complete, will provide $50 million in=20
infrastructure
for the MISO.  The RTO Alliance, which consists of ALSTOM ESCA Corporation
of Seattle, Open Access Technology International (OATI) of Minneapolis,
Perot Systems of Dallas, Texas, and TenFold Corporation of Salt Lake City,
Utah, will deliver an electricity transmission system that will enable
MISO to match electricity demand with available transmission. The hardware
and software in the ICCS project will support MISO's operational functions
including transmission planning, reservation, scheduling, real-time monitor=
ing
and control, settlement and billing.  Dr. Cordaro also stated that Lodestar
was involved in the MISO and that communications had been outsourced to
AT&T Solutions.

Keith Stamm of Aquila Energy went next.  Keith began by clarifying Aquila's
focus as trading: owning very little assets in a high-volume, low-margin,
high-volatility business.  I/T is very important in the trading business.
 Real-time information must be known and disseminated appropriately to
the right individuals.  Keith believes that one of Aquila's strategic asset=
s
and strengths is its risk management system.  Aquila strives for a real-tim=
e
calculation of risk.

Aquila Energy, a subsidiary of UtiliCorp United, Inc., has been a surprisin=
g
winner in the trading marketplace this year, showing a 113-percent growth
since last year with $9 billion total revenue for the past six months,
of that $55 million in trading revenue compared to $18 million in 1999.
The EBIT was $34.2 million vs. $9 million a year ago. Aquila has gathered
top traders and intellectual, financial, and risk management personnel
to enthusiastically participate in the power marketing race.

Keith mentioned a recent alliance with five other companies =01* including
top traders AEP and Duke Energy =01* as an investment step Aquila perceived
was necessary to keep pace with trader tycoon Enron and other online tradin=
g
platforms. The Energy Trading Consortium (Duke Energy, AEP, Aquila Energy,
Reliant Energy, Southern Company Energy Marketing and El Paso Energy) is
in progress to create an exchange that the participants hope will reap
benefits from the transaction cost, liquidity, volume and speed of exchange=
.
 This consortium differentiates itself from EnronOnline by bringing many
buyers and sellers to the platform as opposed to one-to-many.  Another
competitor recently launched is e-Speed's TradeSpark.

James Pignatelli of UniSource Energy went last and had some controversial
statements concerning information technology.  James stated that I/T in
the vertically integrated utility is not strategic, at least not at the
present time.  James believes that I/T will become strategic someday (in
the deregulated market).

James claims getting frustrated with platform switching in the I/T arena.
 He mentioned pulling in his I/T folks and saying, ""Let's switch the=20
distribution
network to DC power and once the public has bought new appliances, we'll
switch back to AC."" While James' comments may have been controversial with
the more than 500 attendees and approximately 50 energy CIOs in the audienc=
e,
he does have a point.  The vertically integrated utility's core strength
is to generate power and distribute it to ""captive"" customers reliably.
 While some I/T systems (like outage management and SCADA devices) may
be strategic in this sense, the other parts of I/T are questionable and
could be candidates for outsourcing.

James claims to be working on B-2-B and B-2-C initiatives at the moment.
 His vision for B-2-C is a smart chip in the residence that has access
to instantaneous pricing information.  The residence will ""buy"" electricity
for itself from the most efficient supplier and it will be able to reduce
load, thereby reducing the T&D utility to a simple conduit for service.


James and Charles Bayless both were involved in New Energy Ventures prior
to its sale to AES.  In 1997, Tucson Electric invested $3 million in NEV
and Charles Bayless (then Tucson Electric's chairman, president and chief
executive officer) and James Pignatelli (Tucson Electric's senior vice
president and chief operating officer) served on New Energy Venture's=20
administrative
committee.

It is interesting to view the different parts of the energy marketplace
as it unbundles and the profound impact that is occurring on the associated
I/T systems.  If one were to stop and think about it, deregulation could
not occur without the complex I/T systems that are employed today in the
marketplace.  I wonder what Thomas Edison and Samuel Insull would have
thought about an unbundled electric marketplace.  It is, in fact, undoing
their design of an integrated electric system constructed for operational
efficiency.

1012,"Britt- great memo.  I'm sure you guys are in the course of discussing these 
very issues, but here's my two cents worth. 
1.  Once we decide on an optimal forum, the key step before filing a lawsuit 
is the assessment of our probability of success--for different reasons than 
is usually the case.  We need to weigh the chances of a favorable judgment 
against El Paso against the probability and extent of collateral damage to 
our defense (not just TW but all of GPG) in Quinque, et al.  
2.  I like our case a lot based on what I've seen so far--if I've got it 
right, our claim is that El Paso breached the 1990 measurement agreement by 
not calibrating the meters as required and therefore by allowing the error to 
arise and remain uncorrected for so long.  Under the NM statute, we may get 6 
years worth of recovery ( or more, I guess, if they did something to toll the 
SOL).  Under the Texas SOL, maybe less.  Do we have a good argument that the 
1% standard in the measurement agreement and the 2% standard in El Paso's 
tariff do not absolve them of conversion or breach liability?  Seems to me 
that El Paso will argue that the FERC tariff preempts our contract 
rights--but I think the law is on our side there.  
3.  The tricky issue then becomes whether our prosecution of the claim 
against El Paso plays into the hands of our adversaries on the Quinque mess.  
If so, how do we quantify that risk to allow a rational balancing of the pros 
and cons.  I'm glad smart guys like you two will have to do that thinking.  
As usual, I'll try to stay on the sidelines and nod intelligently when you 
make a recommendation.  DF

1023,"Per our conversation and/or my voicemail, we are currently evaluating recapitalizing EOTT's subordinated units.  Specifically, we are considering converting Enron's subordinated units (7 million in total) to either cash or EOTT common units.  The exchange ratio would be between .25 - .35/unit.  For example, assuming a .30 (30%) exchange rate, the value to Enron would be as follows:

1.  7,000,000 * .3 = 2,100,000 units
2.  2,100,000 * $16.95 (today's closing price) = $35.59 million

Additionally, we would convert the APIs (currently valued at $9.3mm on the balance sheet) using the same exchange rate.  For example, assuming a .30 exchange rate, the value to Enron would be as follows:

1.  $9.3mm * .3 = $2.79mm

I would appreciate if you could determine the Net Income/Loss for the transaction (sale/conversion of the sub units and the APIs) under three scenarios (.25, .30 and .35 exchange rates).  Stan and Mitch will be meeting with Skilling on Wednesday early afternoon so I would appreciate if you could get back to me as soon as possible.

Egan does not have a contract number so Brenda will determine that.  Also,

Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression 
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a 
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make 
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a 
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and 
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE 
compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.   
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental 
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental 
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the 
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it 
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.  
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing 
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure 
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other 
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression 
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights 
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more 
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for 
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed 
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should 
be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after 
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  
Please realize that this is a ""window"" and the opportunity will close 
after Noon on June 23, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value 
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on 
this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  ""open season"" request on Dominion Gathering.

I just wanted to mention a few things.  I'm sure you are doing them already 
most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.

Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field
Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in 
Tagg
Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg
Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal
Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for 
every EOL deal
Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this, 
just let me know and I'll follow up.

Thanks.

If any schedules are cut that are EPE generation, we need to handle it in a 
specific way.  Our first attempt should always be to make the downstream 
marketer sell the energy at PV (or wherever the cut is) just like we would on 
any Enron schedule.  Be forceful and do not simply agree to back down 
generation.  It was a firm sale and it is their power.  However, if they 
cannot find a home for the power, or are unwilling to, tell them you will be 
forced to sell it for them and let them know that they would most likely get 
a higher price than you would, as they have more interest in that price.  If 
all else fails, you may book out the schedules by backing down EPE gen.  If 
you do this, the price you buy the energy back at must be lower than the 
generation cost.  EPE is never pleased when we buy back a firm schedule for a 
price higher than the gen cost.  If you do bookout a schedule, show it as a 
purchase in the EPE model with a comment as to what it is.  If you have any 
questions about the cuts or correct enpower procedure, ask Bill or myself.

I had along talk with Joel at Cargill today and discussed future business 
opportunities with them. As everybody that worked this weekend knows Cargill 
has been buying from EL PASO at way above market all Saturday and Sunday. 
They are taking this power to MARKETPLACE where LA Trannie is taking it to 
NOB S/N. They are selling this power to utilities in the NW for a low price. 
They do no do to much business in the West and don't have our knowledge and 
connections. I told Joel that we would be very interested in buying this from 
him at a competitive price.  

Whoever works Monday day needs to set up a BPA Account for LADWP - SNO 
account on the DC with Enron paying everything. 

I also discussed the posibility of us selling them power at MEAD. They would 
not want the 7MW scraps from LV, but are very interested in the LV 50MW 
pieces from 11-16. This could be a good way of selling LV at a very good 
price. 

I do believe they have this trannie all month and this could be a really 
sweat deal for us. So lets be ""fair"" to these guys as I am sure once we get 
to know them there are other things we can do with them.

Before we are certain who is leaving and who is staying it might not be the

Two quick things...

First- from volume management:
When scheduling a service customer such as Harbor or WheelabratorShasta, 
Arco, Tosco, etc. we need to be sure to schedule using the customer ID in 
CAPS.  Otherwise RT has no generation and we are considered short (please see 
myself or Kourtney with questions).


Second- from the preschedulers:
If we sit at Lisa or Stacy's desk, please be sure to log out of the computer 
and their phone.   Their computers are not necessarily for Real-Time use,  
but I would like to be sure that we can continue to use these computers at 
night.  If they aren't happy with the cleanliness of their desk, or with 
having to reset their computers each morning, etc...we will probably lose 
this priviledge.

Other than that, 

Keep up the good work.

A quick reminder.  When doing a buy/resale where we are purchasing from a 
counterparty, please make the buy price the price you pay the counterparty 
and the sell price the price the counterparty pays you.  So for a $5 
buy/resale at 130/135 the legs would be a buy at $135, and a sell at $130.  
In scheduling you will see a positive price of $5.  A negative price in

A busy day in India that is likely to generate substantial press.

MSEB sent us 2 letters stating that there will be no Phase II performance 
testing, MSEB will not pay any further amounts under the PPA and MSEB will 
draw no further power from Dabhol.  MSEB requested that DPC stop providing 
availability declarations.  These letters turn the vague ""recission"" letter 
that we received last week into a more concrete repudiation by MSEB.

On Friday, MSEB filed a 120 page petition with the Maharashtra Energy 
Regulatory Commission seeking relief on a number of issues.  MSEB's position 
seems to be that because they are no longer bound by the PPA, that the MERC 
is the appropriate regulatory body to regulate the MSEB/DPC relationship 
(e.g., determine the price for power and the amount owed by DPC on the 
misdeclaration claim).  The MERC ruled today that it likely has jurisdiction 
in this matter and granted some interim relief to MSEB (including stopping 
any arbitration proceedings by DPC against MSEB).  We are preparing a 
petition tor the Bombay High Court to overturn the MERC's actions.

The Government of India continues to state publicly that it will not buy 
power from Dabhol.  Accordingly, we have existing counterparties (MSEB and 
GOM) that do not want Dabhol's power and are not creditworthy and no 
reasonable hope at present to find other viable counterparties.

Credit Derivatives
FOW - November 7, 2001
By Jane Douglas-Jones

In the weeks following the terrorist attacks in the US, credit derivative
traders reported record levels of activity. ""In the immediate aftermath of
the events of 11 September trade ticket size went down,"" says one broker. ""A
lot of people were prepared to make markets in $5m or euros where previously
the average ticket size was $10-15m. The nominal size of the trade went down
as a result of the level of uncertainty and volatility in the markets.""

Traders report that credit default swap trade volume soared to three times
the normal level. ""If nominal ticket value went down by half and trade
volume went up three-fold, overall volumes were up by 5 00/0 in terms of the
actual business being written,"" explains the broker.  After the initial
shock of the devastating attacks, the market recovered its poise and
analysts and traders soon realised the credits that would be most affected.

""Clearly, airline stocks took a pummelling,"" says one trader. ""Prior to the
event, British Airways was trading around 100 basis points for five year
default swaps. After the attacks, BA widened dramatically to 350/SOObp.
Spreads on this credit did come in from this level, but they have since gone
back out again and are currently trading around 380/450bp. Meanwhile, we saw
a credit event on Swiss Air, and German airline Lufthansa also went out,
with all the European airlines following suit.""

Insurance sector
As was expected, the credit derivatives market also saw heightened activity
in the insurance and reinsurance sector. ""There has been a lot of activity
around companies such as Zurich Re,"" says the trader. ""Zurich spreads moved
out from around	20/40bp to 50/100bp. The credit did trade towards the
offered side once or twice. Zurich spreads have stayed in this range despite
the fact that the company has downsized its profits and upsized its
predicted loss (effectively doubling the amount of provision) as a result of
the terrorist attacks.""

Similarly, names such as AXA, Agon, and Aliance have all been actively
quoted in the aftermath of 11 September and spreads have widened
considerably on these names. For example, as FOW went to press Aliance
spreads went out to 7Obp before tracking back in to 35/55bp. In addition,
sectors that have not been considered directly affected by the attacks, such
as the auto sector, also moved out as a result of the potential slowdown in
the US.

""We have seen principle investors in the credit derivatives market trading
either with a view or going by what the spot markets are doing,"" says one
dealer. ""We have also seen quite a few investors gaining synthetic exposure
to bonds by selling default swaps.  Recent weeks have proved a significant
test of the liquidity in the default swaps market. In some areas, the bond
market was extremely thin and it was difficult to trade. However, with
default swaps there was always a price in no more than five minutes. The
market was both traded and tradable.""

Europe
The European credit derivatives market has also had to contend with the
demise of the UK's train operator, Railtrack. ""Railtrack is going to be a
credit event on bankruptcy rather than restructuring,"" says one structurer.
""There was a thought initially that it would go via restructuring and that
would have been an interesting test of the modified ISDA restructuring
supplement. This is still very much an issue in the market. While the US has
adopted the new version, by far the majority of business being done in
Europe and Asia uses the original ISDA 1999 definition of restructuring. The
new restructuring Z supplement has simply not been accepted and I do not
think it ever will be accepted. I expect that we will soon move back along
the lines of the original ISDA wording with perhaps one or two tweaks. 

Overall, traders say that the market has survived the seismic shock of the
events of 11 September extremely well. ""There was no mad panic,"" says one
broker. ""The credit derivatives market made a fair and measured response in
the face of tragedy."" 


ISDA publishes amendments to master agreements
IFR - November 3, 2001

As part of its effort to improve counter-party risk management practices,
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association last week released nine
amendments that can be added as attachments to ISDA master agreements. Many
of the changes included in the document were inspired by the market
turbulence in 1998, ISDA said. Ultimately, the amendments will form the
basis of an initial draft of a new master agreement.

Using one amendment, a failure to pay becomes a default one local delivery
day after notice of such failure is given to the relevant party. ""Many
market participants found three local business days after notice to be too
long a period during times of market stress in 1998"" ISDA noted in a
commentary on the amendments. A local delivery day is a day on which
settlement systems are generally open for business.

Under a second amendment, market participants can use a replacement value
method of valuing transactions after early termination of a master
agreement. The replacement method combines elements of the market quotation
and loss methods into one valuation provision, 1SDA said, noting that the
quotation or loss methods are still valid. Because the inability to
communicate notices via email or fax proved unduly restrictive in 1998, an
amendment was added allowing market participants to use these channels to
give notices.

An amendment stating that the occurrence of termination events should be
treated in a manner similar to an event of default also featured on ISDA's
new list of amendments that may be tacked on to master agreements.
According to ISDA, this option was added because a number of members hold
the view that most termination events are credit-related.

ISDA initiated a review of its master agreements' provisions in 1999. The
process took into account recommendations by the counter-party risk
management policy group's 1999 report ""Improving Counter-Party Risk
Management"".


Emerging market issuers press ahead 
Financial Times - November 7, 2001
By Arkady Ostrovsky

Emerging market borrowers are pressing ahead with planned international bond
issues, despite a deepening debt crisis in Argentina. 

Fitch, the credit rating agency, yesterday said Argentina's planned debt
swap would amount to a default. Fitch cut Argentina's credit rating from CC
to C, indicating an imminent default, and left it on rating watch negative. 

""Although the proposed debt exchange has been described as voluntary, public
statements by Argentine officials imply that in the absence of such an
exchange, public debt held by domestic investors is unlikely to be
serviced,"" Fitch said. 

Fitch also said the terms of the new instruments would be inferior to those
of existing debt, including lower coupons and longer maturities. 

However, despite all this, emerging markets remained surprisingly calm with
no visible signs of contagion developing. Emerging markets bond spreads had
hardly moved since last Friday's announcement and the yield spread of some
countries, including Brazil, had even tightened. This is because there is
little leverage in the system, compared with the 1998 Russian crisis, and
because most market participants were prepared for an Argentine default. 

Several emerging market issuers said they were pressing ahead with bonds
despite Argentina's troubles. 

Bulgaria is likely to launch its debut euro-denominated international bond
next week. Its finance minister said yesterday the country would not launch
the bond if it had to pay a coupon above 8.5 per cent. 

But bankers close to the deal were confident Bulgaria could borrow at
between 7 and 8 per cent, or between 380 and 420 basis points over the
eurozone benchmark, depending on the maturity. Bulgaria is considering a
three-year or five-year issue of up to Euros 255m. 

Emerging market analysts said Bulgaria's economy was in good shape, despite
eurozone economic slowdown and falling export revenues. The country, rated
B2 by Moody's and B+ by Standard & Poor's, has attracted healthy levels of
foreign direct investment by selling its banks to foreign banks, has pegged
its currency to the euro and has met several Maastricht criteria. 

""Bulgaria is the final country to offer extra value as an EU convergence
play. It is unrecognisable as the state engulfed by crisis five years ago,""
said Charles Robertson, emerging markets analyst at ING Barings. 

Latvia, which is on a roadshow in London today, is also pushing ahead with a
bond issue. Sibneft, Russia's oil company, said it would also go ahead with
a three-year Dollars 250m bond issue this month, although other oil
companies have chosen to postpone their issues until next year. If
successful, Sibneft could become the first Russian corporate to issue
international bonds since the 1998 crisis. 

Moody's yesterday assigned Sibneft a rating of B1, a notch above Russia's
sovereign credit rating. 


Dumping ""W""
FOW - November 2001
By Jane Douglas-Jones

Basel Committee for Banking Supervision has been busy in recent weeks. The
Committee has issued guidance to banks on customer due diligence processes,
reviewed its Internal Ratings Based Approach (EBB) to specialised lending
exposures, and published crucial papers on operational risk and market
discipline. In addition, the credit derivatives market breathed a sign of
relief at the Committee's decision to dump 'w'.
In the first of a series of updates on the proposed new Basel Capital
Accord, the Basel Committee's Capital Group has decided to incorporate the
'w' factor (a residual risk charge for credit derivatives) into pillar two
of the Accord's framework, which deals with the supervisory review process.

This move was welcomed by the banking industry and the International Swaps &
Derivatives Association (ISDA), neither of which has been backward in
expressing disapproval of 'w'. The news that the charge is to be assimilated
elsewhere in the Accord came as no surprise given the uproar since w's birth
in the January 2001 Basel consultative paper. As FOW reported (see May
issue, It's the end of
as we know it, page 21), the charge was derided, at ISDA's AGM, by the very
regulators one would expect to defend it and the future of the 'w' factor
has looked bleak since then.

However, some market participants were worried that the Committee would
stand by the charge both because of the immaturity of the credit derivatives
market and also because of the worry that credit risk management instruments
could be used for regulatory arbitrage. ""Any sign of traders using a
derivative to 'get around' a capital charge or regulation has been, in the
past, punished by conservative and complex rules,"" says one source. ""Recent
evidence of this can be found in the securitisation market.""

The demise of 'w' has not meant the end of regulator concern about credit
derivatives. The Capital Group states: ""One of the Basel Committee's
objectives in considering the treatment of credit derivatives in the trading
book is to minimise the possibility of regulatory arbitrage... the Capital
Group is planning to specify a rule that is already implemented by many
supervisors. This rule provides that when a bank conducts an internal hedge
of a banking book exposure using a credit derivative in its own trading
book, in order to receive any regulatory capital benefit it must transfer
the credit risk to an outside third party (ie an eligible credit protection
provider).""

Meanwhile, the Accord's add-on matrix for potential future exposure
calculations does not explicitly cover credit derivatives and rules differ
across countries. 'The Capital Group is working ~to provide proposals that
will harmonise this treatment.

Op risk
The Risk Management Group
(RMG) of the Basel Committee
has also been hard at work. The Group has made a number of significant
changes to the January proposals including:
	*	Refinement of the definition of operational risk
	*	Proposed reduction in the overall level of the operational
risk capital charge from 200/0 to 120/0
	*	Introduction of a new regulatory capital approach that is
based on banks' internal risk estimates (the ""Advanced Measurement
Approaches"" [AMA])
	*	Consideration of the role of insurance as a risk mitigant in
the regulatory capital calculations.

The Group now defines op risk as ""the risk of loss resulting from inadequate
or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events"".
 
Due diligence
In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the US in September, the Basel
Committee has issued guidance and minimum standards to banks on customer due
diligence processes. ""Systemic customer due diligence is an essential
element of banks' risk management,' says William McDonough, chairman of the
Basel Committee. ""It is critical 'to safeguarding confidence and the
integrity of the banking system. The importance of a rigorous approach has
been underscored by the recent terrorist attacks in the US."" 


Basel Committee, IOSCO, IAIS Publish Cross-Sector Reports
Dow Jones Newswires - November 7, 2001

LONDON -- Two cross-sector reports aimed at supervisors in the banking,
securities and insurance industries were published Wednesday by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision, the technical committee of the
International Organization of Securities Commissions, and the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors.

The reports deal with cross-sectoral comparisons of risk management
practices and regulatory capital, and with core principles of the respective
sectors the organizations deal with.

The reports were published by the Joint Forum, established in 1996 to
examine supervisory issues related to financial conglomerates.

In paragraph 11 I would suggest that you consider adding the reason given by 
El Paso for this requested change: internal accounting flexibility, i.e. that 
they may wish to house these swaps in some other El Paso entity in the future 
for bookeeping convenience.  When this change was agreed it was with the 
understanding that the Guaranty would follow the swaps.  Even if the actual 
documentation is ambiguous this was the explicit understanding of those 
present at the time the request was made and the change agreed.

1158,"Hello Mark,

Both Bob and myself have left messages to speak with you about email 
retention time.  Those messages must have been lost, so I have decided to try 
email.

The group we work in, Technical Power Services,  is project oriented.  We are 
an extension of the Engineering department.  As you are well aware the 
development, and construction of power projects can be a minimum of 9 months, 
to as long as 4 years plus.  To give an example, the work that has been 
started on the coal initiative. At $4-$5 mmbtu for gas, the development of 
coal plants becomes more economical.  This development is just starting, 
nothing will be decided for a couple of years, then if it goes ahead 
construction could easily be 3 years or more.

What we are trying to stress is the information that is started in the 
beginning of a project needs flow through to the end of the project, which in 
most instances is longer than a year.

Some of the current power projects we are developing have COD date in 2002 to 
2004.  The retention of email is important to the projects.

The companies that we deal with will be keeping the correspondence and if we 
don't have our own copies, I think you know where this is going.

We would like to discuss this with you.  There has been folders set up in the 
Public mailbox system to give us more than the 100MB limit.  This is very 
helpful since some drawings files we receive can be over 10MB.

We are patiently waiting to speak with you on this subject.

Thank you.

1159,"FYI, attached is the presentation about the Fort Pierce Repowering Project 
that was conceived, put together and made to Louise Kitchen while I was in 
Florida earlier this week working on the Ft. Pierce project. I provided input 
on the contractual legal risk posed by the most current drafts of the  
FPUA/FPRP Development Agreements ( incidentally, the draft Development 
Agreements were approved by the CIty of Fort Pierce and the Fort Pierce 
Utilities Authority Monday and Tuesday). It isn't that clear from the way it 
was formatted, but the risk is described by bullet point with a short 
description of the risk and potential mitigants.

I made no attempt to address other project legal risks in the presentation ( 
for example, the various procurement and  EPC contract risks or legal aspects 
of the development risks ). My understanding is that the attachment was used 
in a presentation seeking authorization to spend an additional $500,000 under 
contracts and commitments already authorized in the prior I - DASH for the 
project. I have not heard whether a formal DASH for this amount is 
contemplated or required. The commercial team is contemplating a full DASH 
for the project prior to executing the Development Agreements on or about May 
11, but that DASH may be hard to complete with precision as we won't have any 
of the three EPC contracts for the deal, and perhaps not the terms of the 
Mitsubshi consent related to the use of the turbine,  negotiated by that time.

1163,"Dan, initially Aleck Trawick was involved with our PPA position when this 
matter only involved what seemed to be a narrow administrative law dispute 
with respect to the Power Pool Council and its proposed rule changes.  
Frankly, I never envisioned that if we were to pursue or consider pursuing 
any remedies against Alberta, the Balancing Pool, the Power Pool Council 
and/or the Power Pool, that the matter would be handled by Aleck.  As you 
know Aleck is putting together a memo due today respecting certain of these 
issues.  After that, I would like responsibility for this matter and all 
litigation matters transferred to Robert Anderson and/or Dalton McGrath.

With respect to our conversation yesterday, the matter will be referred to 
Jim Derrick, General Counsel of Enron Corp., and has been reviewed with Mark 
Haedicke, John Lavorato, and Rob Milnthorp.  At this time in the year Jim is 
very busy, but Jim will review the matter and make decisions respecting the 
use of Canadian counsel sometime in the New Year.  From Rob Milnthorp's, John 
Lavorato's, Mark Haedicke's and my perspective, Robert's and Dalton's

June 25-27, 2001, San  Francisco, CA
Presented by: Infocast 


[IMAGE] Concerns  regarding the price and availability of electricity have 
brought an urgent  call from state governments, regulators, utilities and 
consumers  throughout the West: Build more power plants, and build them 
quickly!  However, as natural gas prices scale to new heights and with the 
electric  transmission system contributing to power outages in San Francisco, 
it has  become clear that the problem is more complex, and that plant 
developments  alone won't resolve the power crisis in the west. While it is 
clear that  something must be done, and done quickly, it is not nearly as 
clear what  the right combination of ""fixes"" is. What is the most 
cost-effective  solution to the energy shortfall?  

This conference, Energy Infrastructure Crisis in  the West, will offer a 
comprehensive view of the shortcomings  of the current energy 
infrastructure--generation, natural gas pipelines  and storage, electric 
transmission-and how these shortcomings might be  addressed through 
development. You will hear from legislators, regulators,  and state officials 
how they are encouraging the development of new energy  infrastructure, and 
from developers and utilities what it will really take  to quickly respond to 
infrastructure needs. Specific issues that will be  addressed include:  

Legislative, utility and consumer views on how to solve the energy  crisis  
Developing new generation--what should be done to expedite the  process?  
Electric transmission bottlenecks--can a solution be quickly found?  
Beefing up the region's natural gas infrastructure--comparing  pipeline and 
storage expansion proposals 

If you are considering  the development of energy assets in western power 
markets, attending this  conference is your best opportunity to learn about 
the prospects for  success. Plus, don't miss our exciting half-day 
pre-conference workshops  ""Economic Evaluation of Quick Fixes to Local Power 
Supply Problems"" and  ""Establishing Demand Response Programs that Work"".  

Register by Friday, May 25, 2001 to receive a SPECIAL DISCOUNT and attend for 
only $795.00  for the conference and $200.00 per pre-conference workshop.

?
As those of you who were able to attend the RRG meeting on  March 23 may 
recall, we received a number of suggestions that the Stage 2 work  process be 
restructured to a more sequenced approach.? That is, in the near  term we 
should focus on key critical path tasks and then return to additional  work 
efforts once the critical path items have been more fully  developed.
?
In response to these suggestions, we have substantially  revised the RTO West 
meeting calendar for the remainder of March and for the  entire month of 
April.? The revised calendar has now been posted on the RTO  West Stage 2 
Main Page, which you can view by clicking on the link  below:
?
http://208.55.67.64/Stage2Index.htm
?
Please note that this revised calendar for the most part  
reflects?cancellations of meetings of work groups whose work has been  
temporarily suspended.? The areas of primary focus for the near term are  the 
congestion model and work on suspension of existing transmission agreements  
among Filing Utilities and the corresponding transfer payments and conversion 
of  rights.? Those working?in these areas may schedule additional meetings  
in April as needed.? There will be?one additional area of work during  April, 
which will involve taking an integrated approach to dealing with issues  
around tort liability, commercial liability, and credit worthiness and 
credit  risk.? Gary Dahlke sent out an e-mail?on this topic some weeks ago 
to  the people who participated in the Stage 1 work on the Agreement 
Limiting  Liability.? So far there are no scheduled meetings?for this 
additional  work effort, but we expect there will be some meetings scheduled 
during the  month of April.
?
Please be assured that the areas in which work is being  temporarily 
suspended?will be addressed; it is just a matter of marshalling  everyone's 
resources in the near term to the most critical tasks.
?
Thank you all very much for your helpful comments and  suggestions.

FERC has stated in several orders what it considers ""material changes"".  You 
may want to look at Duke and Consumers procedures to make sure you are Ok 
with the interpretations.  Those are some of the orders that I would look to 
should a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change.

Also, per your comments on No. 16.  I agree with you on ""commenced 
construction.""  What I mean by ""commenced"" includes the utility purchase of 
easements, etc.  I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing 
to live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to 
proceed and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the 
costs.  [[Customer may want to wait to proceed until it sees the FERC 
decision.]]  Thanks.

interconnection agreement sooner.  Attached is a draft that has not been 
reviewed by Sierra's executives yet, but I talked Gary into giving it to us 
anyway.  

Concerning our transmission request, Gary indicated that Sierra will have to 
perform a study because some other parties are supposedly ahead of us in the 
queue that would affect the available transmission capacity.  He referred me 
to a table on the following OASIS cite showing the competing transmission 
requests.  Stan or Don - please look at this table to see if you think 
Sierra's position has any merits.  I'll give you more details in person.  
Some tariff interpretation issues may also be involved depending upon whether 
other parties are actually ahead of us in the queue.

1207,"We have put together the following list of issues for the request for 
rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order.  We would appreciate your input 
about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who 
will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA).  Requests 
for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001.

We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap 
and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit
$150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?)
Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not 
be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts.
The FERC should clarify its statement that ""to the extent the IOUs' resources 
exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at 
wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules.""  A literal 
interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and 
prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their 
generation and load is located.  We don't care about the IOUs trading options 
but we are concerned about less liquidity.
Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request 
for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from 
Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs.

V project, in spite of having significantly revised the filing on August 1 to 
include TECO in the Phase V project.  FERC staff is working on issuing our 
Environmental Impact Statement, which has been delayed due to the TECO 
filing.   We remain on target, however, for timely receipt of our certificate

RESIGNATION

I am hereby officially tendering 
my resignation as an adult. I  have 
decided I would like to accept the 
responsibilities of an 8  year-old [IMAGE]again. 

I want to go to McDonald's and think 
that it's a four star  restaurant. [IMAGE]

I want to sail sticks across a fresh mud 
puddle and make a  sidewalk with rocks. 

I want to think M&Ms[IMAGE]are better than 
money because you can eat  them. 

I want to lie under a big oak tree and 
run a lemonade stand  with my friends on 
a hot [IMAGE]summer's day. 

I want to return to a time when life was 
simple; When all you  knew were colors,  
multiplication tables, and nursery  
rhymes,[IMAGE]but that didn't bother you, 
because you didn't know what you  
didn't know and you didn't care. 

All you knew was to be happy [IMAGE]because you were blissfully unaware of 
all the  things that should make you 
worried or upset. 

I want to think the world is fair. 
That everyone is honest and  good. 

I want to believe that anything is 
possible. I want to be  oblivious 
to the complexities of life and be 
overly excited by the  little things [IMAGE]
again. 

I want to live simple again. I 
don't want my day to consist of  
computer crashes,[IMAGE]mountains of paperwork, 
depressing news, how to survive  more days 
in the month than there is money in the 
bank, doctor  bills,[IMAGE]gossip, illness, 
and loss of loved  ones. 

I want to believe in the power of 
smiles,[IMAGE]hugs, a kind word, truth, 
justice, peace, dreams, the  imagination, 
mankind, and making angels[IMAGE]in the snow. 

So . . . here's my checkbook 
and my car-keys, my credit card  bills 
and my 401K statements. I am officially 
resigning from  adulthood. 

And if you want to discuss this 
further, you'll have to catch  me 
first, cause........ 
......""Tag! You're  it."" [IMAGE]

Pass this to someone and brighten 
their day by helping them  remember 
the Simple [IMAGE]things in Life. 
((((((((((((((HUGS)))))))))))))) 

[IMAGE]

Hope Ya'll join  me !

Sorry I didn't get this to you earlier today, but I was hung up on Enron 3rd qtr deals all weekend and didn't get a chance to work on it until tonight.  I did check it for consistency with Andersen's documentation and everything is consistent.  FYI - I promised Andersen that I would return their original documentation without retaining or distributing any copies, so I will not have their documentation in any company files.  Let me know if you have any questions (713-853-7046).  Thanks.

I apologize for the delay, earnings release had us swamped!

After discussing the SOP with our expert partner network in Chicago, they
said they believe that this SOP has a 50-60% chance of passing.  Definitely
not a slam dunk.  That group gave me some general guidelines that are
helpful when responding to the standard setters:  stick to the current
literature (other authoritative literature that contradicts/supports your
position), cost vs. benefit analysis of implementing the new rules,
usefullness of new information required by the new standard to the reader,
and try to stick with the facts and try not to be negative (i.e. ""we don't
like it"" type statements).

We are still drafting the official Firm position on the SOP.  However, we
generally agree with the concept that accounting for PP&E/Depreciation
should be consistent and comparable between companies.  Please note, that I
am not trying to persuade you to support the Firm's preliminary views,
rather trying to make the letter more effective when AcSEC reads their
letter.

My comments are on the draft letter attached, with my suggestions and
comments in yellow.  Call me if you have any questions.

1236,"Jim,

I understand that unfortunately you are not able to meet with Keith next
week.  In view of this I attach a note which sets out our logical arguments
for not remaining part of a global programme.

To answer some of your questions more specifically:

We have got an indication of current market premiums from our broker, Steve
Wynne (he has not alerted the market).  Steve has been our broker since 1994
and until recently worked for JLT.  He now has his own company (Kingsbridge)
but retains a business arrangement with JLT.  Steve has extensive knowledge
of the UK water industry and has serviced Wessex to a very high standard
over the years.  Steve would use all the major UK carriers to establish a
programme but I would expect using Royal Sun Alliance and Winterthur at
least (as we have previously done) as they are very active in the UK water
sector.  We do not have any intentions to use a captive (our existing one is
currently being liquidated) as in essence there are very little advantages
of doing so.

Steve and Wessex have just begun the renewals process for the local
policies.  Also understand Steve contacted McGriff about global policy
renewals but got very little response.

All renewals are less than 3 months away and information gathering is
beginning.  Suggest we need to resolve this issue over the next few weeks.

Wessex recognises it is a subsidiary company and Enron has significant
buying power.  However for the reasons set out we still think it makes more
sense to have its own standalone programme topped up by Enron if needs be.

I am happy to discuss or meet on any of this.

Mark

Dear Outpost.com customer,

As you may recall, I sent you an email about five weeks ago about the
tough times for dot-com companies and the tough times we were
experiencing here at Outpost.com. Amazingly, about 7,000 of you sent
us, well, they were pretty close to love letters, in response. Today
I am thrilled to be able to tell you that it now appears that, like
The Rolling Stones, we will indeed be here forever.

We have just announced that our friends at PC Connection have agreed
to acquire your favorite company, Outpost.com. The best part is that
we will remain Outpost.com and we will remain in our gorgeous
headquarters town of Kent, Connecticut. Thus, we will continue to do
business with you as we always have, with a deep commitment to you,
our customers, with our rather healthy sense of humor, and with the
enormous resources that will now be available to us through the PC
Connection family. And yes, the gerbil stays. We wouldn't have it any
other way.

The most immediate impact this will have on our business is that,
effective immediately, we have access to tens of millions of dollars
of inventory on a daily basis. This will help us speed your orders on
their way to you much sooner. The gerbil brought in some of his
buddies to work in the warehouse, so we now have many more hands
(paws?) available there as well.

Needless to say, we are awfully excited about this. PC Connection is
a company we have long admired, and to say that this is a good fit is
quite an understatement. So, the bottom line is that you are stuck
with us. We just won't go away and we plan on finding new and even
more clever ways to entertain you as you shop for a very long time to
come. As a matter of fact, we would really appreciate it if you could
help us name this silly gerbil as we are all getting tired of calling
him, ""Gerbil"". You can do this at:

http://www.outpost.com/template/contest/gerbil/index/

Thanks again for all your support over the past six years. It has
been an honor serving you and getting to know you.

name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's ""Mijo's"" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say ""Mira, tan cute!""

when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, ""I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00.""
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's ""Mijo's"" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her

In preparation for the Outlook migration, we have come up with the basic 
structure of the public folders needed for EWS Legal.  The initial access to 
create and/or rename folders should be given to the users identified next to 
the group and/or subgroup (i.e. for Enron Global Markets - grant access to 
Alan Aronowitz and Nita Garcia).   Upon completion of the migration, the 
assistant assigned to each of these groups will procure access to others in 
her group and create additional folders as they may be needed.

Please let us know if you have any questions regarding the attached 
information.

Thanks.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

 What is meant by a ""new review of this agreement""?  Have they reviewed the 
master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit 
requirements into the standard agreement?  
 I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in 
numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a 
Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or 
purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply 
because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other 
parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability 
provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc.  
Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not 
signed, no agreement.  
 Let's discuss where we go from here.

believe it is in Clement's stack to work on.  I will call him to see where he

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX ""1""  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

""Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day.""

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

",Hyvl,,Customer's Business Day
1309,"Dan,

Here is the latest Westport contract with a few changes I need you to take a 
look at.
Also, in Section 8, what are payment securities? They would like this to be 
defined.
They also would like Section 9 to be bi-lateral.

One other question Westport has is - If the delivery point (screw compressor 
meter) is off the acreage lease, can all the fees be charged back to the 
royalty owners?
I told them you may not want to give an opinion on this and they are alright 
with that.

Let me know your thoughts on all the above.

 The below two documents are the credit worksheet and the contract 
relationship documents which you provided.  The credit worksheet states that 
the guaranty should cover ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. and additionally should cover the master energy agreement with 
EPMI.  Do we have a date of execution or effective date for such master 
energy agreement.  The contract relationship document merely states that the 
guaranty should cover the new master firm purchase sale agreement  that ENA 
is negotiating with Engage and an master energy agreement between EPMI and 
____.  No agreements of any type are specified for ECC or Clinton Energy 
Management Services, Inc.  Also, are any of the Master Swap agreements that 
ENA has with Engage to be covered by the requested guaranty?  I believe that 
we need to get together at your convenience and determine exactly which 
contracts Enron Corp. is to cover with the guaranty agreement being offered 
as a part of the security for the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.

1316,"Grant,
 I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do 
not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the 
above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
 1. I have deleted the word ""DRAFT"".
 2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the 
contract would be executed by the City.
 3. I have changed the word ""may"" to ""shall"".
 4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency 
Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a 
particular point.  I do not think their is an omission.
 5. I have added the word ""reasonable"".
 6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided, 
if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement 
and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the 
issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination 
Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be 
necessary to attain closure.
 7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be 
required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's 
obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend 
the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was 
pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was 
otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
 8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a 
holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article 
3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default 
extends for more than 5 days during any month. 
 9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate 
rating applies to ENA.
 10. I have changed ""a"" to ""the""
 11. I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an event of 
Force Majeure.
 12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due 
when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language 
would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a 
particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as written.
 13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you 
review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were 
referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling it in 
using language that had been provided by the City.
 14. I added the word ""reasonable"".
 15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP.
 16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the 
provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2% 
over prime language.
 17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs 
to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment grade and I 
understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.  ENA is not a rated entity and 
that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating.
 18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the 
requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have 
made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know 
that before we execute the Contract.
 19. I have added the word ""reasonable"".
 20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should 
have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract.  
 21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.  We can agree to 
meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am willing 
to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer.
 22. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our 
Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows 
a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the 
person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.  Therefore , we 
object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.  We believe that 
each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should 
stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to 
the terms and provisions of the Contract.  

 I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you 
care to discuss any of these matters.

1.  as I indicated this morning, ""money"" means actual currency - notes and 
coins - not funds transferred by wire into an account, which would likely be 
treated as an ""intangible"" resulting in the various requirements/concerns I 
pointed to this morning regarding perfection by registration;

2.  although, in their view, the validity of the transfer approach would be 
recognized by a court (in Ontario at least), given that the intention of the 
Transfer Annex is to provide security for contingent obligations under the 
Master Agreement and the lack of relevant case law, there is a material risk 
that the Court would nonetheless characterize the transfer as a security 
interest subject to the requirements for perfection.

With our present understanding, in the absence of any definitive case law, 
and without an unequivocal opinion we can rely on, I am not sure we can rely 
on the transfer approach to solve the problem, particularly with high volume 
counterparties who likely are going to create the largest exposures.

! In abnormal market conditions (as reasonably determined by Koch in good=

a legal incorporated entity means you are embodied as a legal entity after 
filing or creating certain organizational documents under state or federal 
laws (you could be a corporation, partnership,  governmental entity or other 
type of entity).   A division is not a separate legal incorporated entity.   
It is one and the same entity as the incorporated entity.   It is a ""dba""  
(which means ""doing business as"") or ""assumed name"" for an incorporated 
entity. Any division of an incorporated entity can, and usually should, trade 
under the same master as the incorporated entity (unless the company gives us 
some reason elsewise).  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not 
understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same, or 
there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being 
aggregated.That is why we always want the name of the incorporated entity as 
part of the counterparty name when we transact with a division.  Examples 
might be ""Tana Jones Inc., acting through its TLJ Company Division"" or ""Tana 
Jones Inc. d/b/a TLJ  Company"" or ""TLJ Company, a division of Tana Jones 
Inc.""  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a 
division and incorporated entity are one and the same (and we may have to 
talk to them), or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their 
trading from being aggregated with the corporate entity.  Legal and/or Credit 
should direct you when a division should trade under the legal entity's 
master.

Good morning.

As you may know, last Thur. Enron honored this year's recipients of the
Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholars at a dinner in Austin.  In addition to
the three recipients, Business School Dean May and several of my
colleagues, Enron attendees included Sally Beck, Cindy Justice, Karen
Marshall (newly-appointed coordinator of higher education initiatives for
Enron Community Relations Dept.) and Rick Causey.

I write you at this time to advise you I had occasion to discuss two
current Enron/UT issues with Rick:
I.  Spring 2001 Conference Participation by Jeffrey K. Skilling
II.  UT Participation in EnronTraining Activities
Per my conversation with Rick last Thur., I followed up on that discussion
with an e-mail this morn that touched on those two topics.

I.  With respect to the first, I wrote Rick this morning that:

1.  We at the UT Center for Energy Finance Education and Research (CEFER)
are planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2001 (late Feb.
or early March) to discuss four topics:  Risk management, Deregulation,
Real options, and International/globalization.
2.  The Conference will kick off with a dinner/keynote address Thur.
evening, then continue all day Fri.
3.  I have had several discussions with you regarding Conference timing,
structure, participation and content.
4.  Further to Rick's agreement to do so during our discussion last Thur.,
in today's e-mail I asked Rick to extend an invitation to Jeff Skilling to
be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.

II.  With respect to the second topic, Rick and I also discussed UT
partcipation in Enron Corp. internal training for incoming Enron Corp.
analysts and associates.  Consequently, I e-mailed Rick this morning a
specific set of issues -- ""Valuation and Risk Management in Energy Markets""
-- which my UT colleagues and I have covered in public as well as
customized exec ed settings, and which we would be pleased to customize for
presentation at Enron.  FYI, I am enclosing a copy of said topics at the
end of this e-mail.

I look forward to seeing you again soon, and to your UT visit on 10/11.  Best,
Ehud

if you wish to use SAS, there are a few simple things you need to do:

1) you need to get a Unix password if you don't already have one (your user 
id will be the same as on the NT network, but a different password is issued)
2) you need a program called ""Exceed"" on your PC.  request it from IT (you 
already have this if you are already a user of LIM on the Unix platform)
3) you need an ""ftp"" program on your PC. you can go to www.download.com and 
download one (i like wsftp)
4) Exceed is funny in the way it runs. When you invoke Exceed (or LIM 
Advanced User (under Infobases) if you already have this) it will install 
itself the first time, and will then ""disappear"" to the Taskbar. you need to 
*right* click on the taskbar on Exceed, and then choose ""Tools"" and ""Client

I have discovered the two sources of discrepancy in the ""transaction dollars"" 
on EOL, between my numbers and those of EOL. First, EOL records all index 
trades with the Henry Hub price (since the index price isn't, inadvertently, 
recorded with the trade, as I told you), whereas I went back and appended the 
contemporaneous index price to the trades. Second, EOL ignores all Basis 
trades in reporting transaction dollars, whereas I append a rough size to 
them of the ""price"" as the basis, times the quantity.

I'm sorry I wasn't ready in time with my numbers; I took the task of accuracy 
very seriously.

the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest
privately owned
manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing 
its
finances,
so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annual
revenue and
to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the
business of
manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R))
food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other
products.

Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that
emphasizes the
long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win
solutions with
its suppliers, customers and partners.

As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its
expenses
goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of
researching
those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand
(people
eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).

CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very
successful,
with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in
these arenas.
CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports 
the
purchasing
function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a
multidiscipline and
multinational team with a lot to offer.

Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based
on
manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in 
this
area.
Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to
talk to.

In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to
anything
at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to
pursue the opportunity
we discussed in the future.

I am looking forward to our video conference call.

Kind regards,

Avi

1474,"Hi Vince,

	Amitava and I have received a request to build a non-firm power curve for each region from David Hoog's Double Trigger folks.  The objective, as they explain it, is to allow the Desk to buy non-firm from the market, buy David's outage product, and sell firm to the market.  Accountants would like a curve to mark the non-firm position.
	My initial thought is that the desk should provide this non-firm curve, but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in David Hoog's court to build the curve if David wants to sell his product internally to the desk.  
	Assuming we build the curve, the next issue is how to define ""non-firm""?  The only way I can think of is to tie the non-firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units.  This will allow the purchase of David's outage product to cover the non-firmness risk.  Tying the definition of non-firmness to a whole region seems implausible ",Vince Amitava David Hoog's David,,

iron within the next several years.  The structure is still very early in its 
development, but I think there will be commercial opportunities for Enron in 
bandwidth and electricity.  I would be interested to know what issues you two 
would see as the greatest hinderences and possibilities for these markets.

1476,"Executive Summary
Discussions continue today over bill AB1X, focus will be on price and term.
New legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the 
utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities' hydro assets in 
exchange for rate increases.
Wednesday, state receives bids from auction, rate ranges are expected to be 
between 5.5 and 8.0 cents per kilowatt hour.
Mid week, audit  findings will be released; audit expected to show PG&E's 
utility subsidiary handed over $5B to the holding company. The holding 
company used $4.4B to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock.
State commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible 
bankruptcy scenario.  Bankruptcy still very possible for both 
      companies.
Davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue 
solutions or ""bail out"".

Legislation
There will be continued discussion regarding bill AB1X in the Senate today.  
The discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour as 
well as the term.  Assemblyman Keeley, the author, indicated that he believed 
5.5 cents was ""a fantasy"" and impossible to obtain. 

Today, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred 
Keeley, D-Boulder Creek will introduce legislation whereby the state
would temporary or permanently take both PG&E and Edision's hydroelectric 
facilities or transmission lines (or both) in exchange for keeping the 
utilities out of 
bankruptcy.  The state would allow PG&E and Edison to impose rate increases, 
however, the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this 
month by the CPUC as an emergency surcharge.  The money collected from 
consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state 
would then enter into long-term contracts with power generators.  Under the 
bill, the state of California would control 10% of all California's 
electricity.  As you 
can imagine, this legislation has not received unanimous praise.  According 
to recent corporate filings, PG&E's hydroelectric plants alone would be 
valued 
between $3 and $5 billion.  This amount just happens to be what Davis 
estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee 
once 
the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is 
escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $12 billion in debt.  
Davis 
is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help 
with about $4 billion in debt, while the utilities, of course, say the full 
$12 billion should 
be covered. 

On Wednesday, state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy 
suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their 
effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come.  Davis 
insists there are already several bids for his 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour 
ceiling, though few 
agree with his opinion.  A handful of smaller, independent electricity 
providers with about a 30% share of California power market, indicated Sunday 
night they would come down to ""less than eight cents"" or less than half of 
what they currently charge, in return for the stability of long term 
contracts.  Because 
consumers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current 
PUC rules, any hope California has to ""work off"" the back debts for these 
utilities lies 
in hitting something very close to Davis' price cap, without falling back on 
higher prices for consumers.  The level of bids will be particularly 
important since bond
rating agencies moved to put the state of California on a Credit watch on 
Friday, worried that there was no obvious long-term repayment plan for the 
billions of 
dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state.

Utility's Audit
By the middle of this week, California auditors will release their findings 
about how much money PG&E and SoCal Edison actually owe to institutions 
outside their own holding company structure. This will define the limits of 
what the state will guarantee, if they guarantee any of the debt. The truly 
explosive 
part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of 
dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years.  A  
source with
knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last 
three years, PG&E's utility subsidiary handed over about $5 billion to the 
holding 
company. Of that total, the holding company used $4.4 billion to pay 
shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock. 

Another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current 
power crisis when regulators, at the time of deregulation (under the 
direction of 
Former R-Gov. Pete Wilson), forced the two utilities to sell at least half of 
their power-generating plants.  Auditors are expected to say that if the 
utilities 
still owned all these plants, electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt 
hour, compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in December and January.

Bankruptcy
The threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities.  Senior 
advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility 
companies that 
ended in bankruptcy.  As all the parties involved hunker down for another 
intensely political week, they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy, but 
to push 
this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an 
advantage.  Under such conditions, the risks of one or more of the players 
fumbling and
triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy, is still quite high. 
 
California's political leaders order a series of independent analyses to 
determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy, the state or the two 
utilities.
The short answer was that no one has any idea.  Below are the findings of the 
report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge:

1) Would the companies be eligible for Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy? 
Some of the advisors thought that PG&E and Edison's finances were so 
bad that Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option.  
Advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate 
debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the 
companies into full liquidation.   This would most certainly be guaranteed 
chaos.
2) Could the bankruptcy court actually force the PUC to raise the price of 
electricity to consumers? The legal basis for passing on rate increases to 
consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought, particularly if there 
is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies.   And 
there is still the 
question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge.
3) If the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets 
seriously and finds that PG&E and Edison cannot afford to buy electricity, 
he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages.
4) If the utilities go into bankruptcy, the first creditors in line would be 
the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges.  The state could become 
almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier  
(one of the reasons why suppliers won't sell electricity on credit to these 
companies now).
5) If the two companies went bankrupt, it would be the largest bankruptcies 
in history, straining just about everyone involved in the process.
6) The corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets 
from the utility by the FERC for PG&E and already in place for Edison 
may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies 
currently think. This is particularly true if this week's audit shows the two 
corporations transferring 
billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder 
dividend payments.

Davis
Opinion polls show that Governor Gray Davis is getting high marks for his 
job, and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits.  One of Davis 
concern's is, according to a senior official in the Governor's office, that a 
deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so 
anti-utility and 
anti-business that it cripples future growth in the state.  According to a 
senior official, ""No one thought Howard Jarvis and his property tax 
initiative would 
succeed in destroying our education system, but he did, with one just ballot 
line and a lot of popular revulsion. The threat of direct, popular action
is at least as large now as then.""  Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield is 
already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that 
individual 
electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay 
their debt through higher rate-payer bills.  This official goes on to say, 
""The 
anger at utility companies is so high here, that almost anything Rosenfield 
could think of would pass and we couldn't do anything about it.""  This threat 
has 
begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always 
appeared wide open to political leaders -- floating a bond issue or a 
guarantee 
for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure, 
and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next 
several years. ","bill AB1X Davis Keeley Bob Hertzberg Fred

",Kim Dale Vince,,
1478,"Shirley: 
As requested, herein is information regarding the meeting with Vince Kaminski.  
The presentation on the EGE tool's applications and the Allegheny Energy case study is timed to take an hour.  If the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for Tuesday, May 29, might I request it be set for late afternoon (as my other appointments are the next day).  
And, as Vince will recall, I was Co-Leader of the energy consulting business of PHB Hagler Bailly, and developer of the Ramp Up, Real Time, 75check and Electric Strategy tools.  Presently, I am CEO of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC).
    Background
The U.S. power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years.  Rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively.  Utilities, who still control most power plants, endeavor to adopt the entrants' methods.  Yet, inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread.
Utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades-old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling.  Many utilities, notwithstanding the industry-wide trend towards profit maximization, cling to ingrained routines.
Inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale.  A utility may operate a relatively small system (fewer than a dozen plants).  A small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers, playing the wholesale market at the margin.
For a variety of reasons, utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units, let alone shut down any (even temporarily or seasonally).  Economically inefficient units continue to be committed, week after week, and run in the half-load range.
    EGE Objectives
EGE identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines.  Taking into account transmission and reliability factors, the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant.
    I. An industry participant can use EGE as a basis for a medium or long-term wholesale power transaction with a utility; or to price wholesale power more aggressively, to take market share from the utility (i.e., compel changes in unit commitment habits).  
    II. An industry participant can use EGE to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition.  
    III. A power plant developer can use EGE to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility's unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized.
    Specific EGE Concepts
EGE reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities.  
It produces indicative statistics such as:
    a. the frequency distribution of starts per week;
    b. the frequency distribution of starts by day/15-minute segment during the week;
    c. the frequency distribution of load level;
    d. the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start;
    e. average heat rate and approximate fully-allocated cost in the half-load range;
    f. average ramp rate from the half-load range;
    g. the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours; and
    h. forced-off maintenance outage rate (where indicated).
Indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month/year; in some cases, by temperature range.  (They can be by regional wholesale prices as well.)  EGE establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years.
EGE is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data.  EGE is now updated for the 4th quarter 2000 (through December 31, 2000).  EGE 1st quarter 2000 (through March 31, 2001) will be available approximately June 15, 2001.
EGE also compares and ranks generating units' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility (as well as other regional generators).  Some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half-load level for lengthy time periods (without an apparent reliability basis), splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units.
Other EGE supporting data:
    i. planned maintenance schedule (where indicated);
    j. actual maximum generating capacity;
    k. actual minimum generating capacity (actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government-reported values);
    l. average heat rate in the full-load range; and
    m. average heat rate in the three-quarter-load range.
With respect to a generating units' average heat rate in the half-load, three-quarter-load and full-load ranges, it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region.  It can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities, and changes in recent years in these parameters.
    The Real-World Example of Allegheny Energy
Allegheny Energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of EGE.  In the 4th quarter 2000, for instance, one high-cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning (52 times) and committed for the whole day (in all but two cases).  Arguably, there are power products that could substitute for this routine (in part at least) at a profit to the seller of the product and Allegheny Energy.
Another high-cost Allegheny Energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn (nine times) and committed for most of the coming week.  At another plant, two high-cost units were operated too often in the expensive half-load range (some 550 hours) and three-quarter-load range (another 400 to 600 hours); they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels.  Again, there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to Allegheny Energy.
    Offering of Energy Leader Consulting (ELC)
EGE is a procedure, not a software package or data base.  ELC believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities.
ELC transfers its ""knowledge"" about the EGE procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight-forward four-step process:
    1. Enron would select one to three target utilities.
    2. ELC would perform the EGE procedure on the target utilities.
    3. Employing this real-world analysis as a pedagogic tool, ELC, in a one-day seminar with Enron personnel, would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future (without the assistance of ELC).
    4.  Optionally, ELC would provide EGE supporting data, quarterly, to Enron.
The basic EGE supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program (virtually all fossil fuel units).  Parameters that are incorporated, and the data set format, will be specified upon request.  Custom modifications will be considered.

Here is my thoughts on the upcoming reorg.  In my mind,
it seems logical to create a team specialized in EWS trading/origination
support.  

I would suggest Vasant to oversee EBS support.  Where do you
want to put  the power fundamental team ?  Vasant has more 
experience to manage this team although they can be also classified
as trading support.  In term of head counts, I am inclined to let Vasant
supervise this team.

Afghanistan Ground War

We believe plans are progressing for ground action in Afghanistan to begin over the next week. Rumsfeld and Bush are both overseas and it is unlikely that the attack would commence prior to their return.  Forces earmarked for deployment include US Marines, US Rangers and British Marines. The Pentagon has reportedly suggested to London that it reclassify its marine commandos and paratroopers as ""special forces"" so the operation may still be depicted as an SF one. 

The tactical aims of such operations - which will see troops inserted by helicopter from Pakistan and then extracted via the same route - will be to destroy identified Al Qaeda targets in areas theoretically under Taleban control. 

Anthrax

More incidents today with media outlets and politicians being the primary targets.  There is a wide variety of media reporting on this, most of it unreliable.  We reiterate that the U.S. government is equipped to handle isolated incidents of cutaneous anthrax exposures, but is not equipped to handle air-dispersed anthrax attacks on a wider scale, or more contagious biological weapons such as smallpox.  The main impact of the current incidents (aside from those directly affected) is psychological; a further escalation of the sense of worry, which increases both political and economic pressure on the Bush Administration.  Politically, there will be increased pressure ""to do something"" not only against the bin Laden network, but possibly Iraq. Economically, the anthrax incidents are simply another serious blow to consumer confidence. The Congressional incidents also are delaying passage of the fiscal stimulus package.

Terrorist Sophistication Targeting Critical Infrastructure Not to be Overlooked

The anthrax incidents also represent yet another attack against US critical infrastructure.  Just as the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks represented attacks on our transportation infrastructure, financial infrastructure, and government infrastructure, so too do the anthrax attacks target our government infrastructure (Congress, Gov. Pataki) and our communications infrastructure (Fox/CBS/ABC/NBC & mail delivery).  Both the September l1th attacks and the anthrax incidents have hit targets that are significant both as critical infrastructure and as symbols of American power.  The threat at Three Mile Island reported last night suggests that the possibility of attacks against energy infrastructure should certainly not be ignored and should probably be expected.

***********************************************************************

NATURAL GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES

Despite high storage levels, with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash
market has bounced back from early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu.
However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased
US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA
expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.

*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are
increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.

*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential
and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a
weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the
industrial sector.

*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward
pressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security issues
around LNG shipments.

Today's focus: Companies worth investigating

By Mike Karp

Just what is a good working definition of Storage Resource
Management? As I pointed out last week, understanding a
vendor's definition of SRM goes a long way toward helping you
understand their approach to the technology and the value the
vendor can deliver.

Some companies don't lay out this information too well when
they visit prospective customers, either because they didn't
consider including it in their presentation, or (and this is
indicative of an entirely different type of company) they are
too focused on their technology for technology's sake.

Most of us shouldn't waste too much time on vendors that have
not thought about how they can help us - if they haven't taken
the time to understand our business needs, we probably
shouldn't take the time to listen to their needs.

We can perhaps be more generous to the other set of companies,
the group that often develops technology for technology's sake.
Those vendors are often young firms with ideas that are
exciting, new and frequently useful, but a reality check shows
that they need to realize (as has been so well pointed out in
the last few years), that this sort of business approach only
appeals to a very small segment of the market referred to as
""early adopters."" It doesn't carry much weight with the rest
of us, the majority of whom need to see proven business values
to justify their expenditures.

Historically, new and relatively small companies have fallen
into this second category: it's the ""two guys in a garage
syndrome."" These days however, I see several that are getting
past the technology-first bias and seem to be making a real
effort to provide us with business solutions we can actually
use. Every few weeks I like to point out one or two of these
for you, on the theory that while what they do may not be right
for most of you, it will likely be of use to some of you. And
when they lay out their value propositions and identify their
approach to SRM, it is easy for you to calibrate what they are
bringing to the table.

This week's interesting find is TrelliSoft, a company out of
Glen Ellen, IL (http://www.trellisoft.com) that provides SRM
services across a number of platforms. Its Java-based architecture
potentially means a single solution to solving problems across
a number of operating systems. The problems Trellisoft addresses
include disk space optimization, quota enforcement, storage
chargeback and capacity planning.

One feature I particularly appreciated is its ability to
identify files NOT backed up, which can go a long way toward
eliminating surprises during the business day.

If you would derive value from these capabilities in your shop,
Trellisoft is probably worth a look.

1503,"TITLE: Access on the Block: International Transmission Auctions Are Opening 
European Power Markets 
E-mail Category: CERA Insight 
CERA Knowledge Area: European Power 

Despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among European transmission 
system operators, regulators, and the European Commission in Florence, 
auctions of international transmission capacity (ITC) in France, the United 
Kingdom, Denmark, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, and the 
Netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the 
single European marketplace.

However, the patchwork auctioning of access to ITC leaves important issues 
unresolved. The most significant of these include the potential for gaming, 
third-party transit, and the allocation of auction proceeds. As they stand, 
these issues, CERA believes, are likely to lead to action at the European 
level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme.

Nevertheless, current plans to open most of Europe's ITC represent a 
watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and 
determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in 2001.

International Auctions Are Opening Markets 
A major portion of international transmission capacity on the Continent will 
be allocated by auction in 2001 (see Table 1). In CERA's view auctions for 
ITC are likely to have the greatest impact during 2001 in the following areas:

* Increasing market transparency. The posting of available transmission 
capacity on yearly, monthly, and daily bases will facilitate the market's 
efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity. For the first time, 
signals for new transmission investment, power flows, and transmission asset 
valuation will come from the market.

* Increasing cross-border trade. Although auctions may not reduce uncertainty 
in the marketplace initially, the effect of heightened transparency in access 
rules and prices will soon work to increase trade. Secondary markets for 
interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power 
products and work to increase the overall level of trade.? 

* Increasing price correlation. Auctions will replace nonmarket-based 
allocation methods such as long-term capacity reservation. The dynamic 
character of shorter-term auctions, combined with an expected secondary 
market for capacity, should bring access to international capacity in line 
with the needs of the market. In this way the market will be able to adjust 
more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate 
pricing points.

* Increasing competition. Once players have secured access to ITC at a given 
price, they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the 
capacity into structured deals. The result could be more aggressive 
maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike, resulting in 
greater competition at the national level.

* Reducing the competitiveness of imports. The results of international 
transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported 
power into domestic markets. Final prices offered for ITC will reflect the 
relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more 
expensive to import.

* Spurring investment in transmission. The money raised through auction could 
provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in 
upgrading international transmission links. Access to international 
transmission capacity between the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium in 2001 
was auctioned for 63 million euros (see http://www.tso-auction.org for 
details).? Auctions for access into Spain, France, and Italy are expected to 
realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets. 

Connecting Rather than Integrating Markets 
Auctions between national grids, or more accurately commercial grids, are a 
pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international 
transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis. The auctions will 
open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission 
system operators.

Even so, the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or 
the stated objectives of European policymakers. In CERA's view the following 
issues may eventually bring down the hammer on ITC auctions:

* Third-party transit. The bilateral nature of ITC auctions perpetrates the 
problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit 
through a third grid. This is ultimately inconsistent with the European 
Commission's objective of a single European power market. The fact that 
physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always 
transit third-party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach.

* Transaction-based scheme. Although still transactional in nature (tied to a 
specific deal), auctions fall within the European Commission's stated 
preference for market-based mechanisms for allocating international 
transmission capacity. It remains to be seen how successful this approach is 
in achieving integration of national markets. Action at the European level 
could move allocation of ITC in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms 
such as market splitting, counter trading, or redispatching. 

* Gaming of auctions. Auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission 
on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most. In practice 
it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided. Even though most of the 
auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity, tactical 
maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price 
of imported power.

* Allocating auction proceeds. One likely outcome of auctions will be the 
transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the 
rents currently reaped by other players. This will works to raise the value 
of transmission assets relative to generation, suppliers, or traders. It 
remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among 
transmission companies and the grid, as transmission is still currently 
subject to monopoly regulation.

1507,"Dear Vince / Christie,

Thanks for coming to Philadelphia to present an overview of the projects. We 
enjoyed meeting you and your colleagues and look forward to working with 
Enron.  I would also like to pass on my team's appreciation for the dinner as 
well.

We wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and 
additional information prior to our upcoming visit to Houston on January 
19th. Our project is going to be geared to the 3rd option you mentioned.  We 
plan on addressing some part of the Retail Energy Services business.  We are 
considering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either
(i)how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to 
serve retail customers, OR
(ii) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas 
for further investments.

However, we would like to get some more information on the Retail Energy 
Services before truly scoping the project.  We are also very open to 
suggestions, especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind; 
so please let us know.

We have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week, but 
here are the questions we have specific to the Retail Energy Services unit:

Can we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is 
in the annual report?
What is the pricing philosophy/overall structure?
Who are the customers and how are they acquired?
What would the customers be doing if they did not work with Enron?
What are the international expansion plans and capabilities?
Is there any important regulatory summary information we can have?

If this information is not already covered in the review material you sent, 
will you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information?

After we have reviewed the material sent to us recently, we may want to 
schedule a phone call with you and/or one of your colleagues directly 
involved in the Retail Energy Services business.  I would like to call you in 
the new year to discuss this further.  In the meantime, please feel free to 
call me at (215) 546-9416 if you need any information.

1538,"Dear Vince,

	We have been working on the curriculum for some of the educational
programs to be offered by the Energy Markets Institute that Arthur Warga and
I discussed with you in the summer.  I am attaching (tentative) curricula
for two important programs: (1) A graduate certificate in Energy Finance,
(2) A 5-year BBA/MS program in Energy Finance.
	Briefly, the certificate is a 5-course for-credit program that is
available to people with sufficient basic background in finance, economics,
statistics and mathematics.  This certificate includes coursework in
accounting issues specific to the energy industry, basic aspects of energy
sources and the organization and regulation of energy industry, forecasting
and time-series econometric methodologies, basics of financial engineering
and derivatives, real-options and project analysis as it applies to the
energy industry, and energy derivatives and risk-managament.
	The 5-year program is more ambitious. It seeks to provide a broad
but rigorous curriculum for future energy industry professionals and
managers. In the undergraduate component students take rigorous courses in
math, probability and statistics, economics, chemistry and physics, and
accounting and finance. This is conceived to be an ""elite"" and highly
demanding program where students have to handle the more demanding courses
in a variety of areas.  The 5th or graduate year of the program is given
over to the energy certificate and additional graduate courses in finance
and accounting.
	I know you are extremely busy, but it would be very helpful to get
your reaction (even at a broad level) to these programs and the type of
courses that are envisaged.  We view these programs to potentially form the
core of the educational activities of the Institute, but the next step would
be to develop more specialized programs (of shorter duration) aimed at
professionals already working on challenging problems in the industry. We
are in the process of setting up the Institute and developing its governance
and administrative structure. I will give you more details very shortly.
	On another topic, Darrell Duffie (with whom I interacted with a lot
during our student days at Stanford) will be coming to present a seminar at
the Bauer College on January 10. We very much hope to see you and the Enron
group there.
	Finally, I hope that you and all of your loved ones and colleagues
are as well as possible in light of the recent tragedies. We can only hope,
pray and work to see that these senseless acts never again occur anywhere.


Best wishes,

Praveen

I am an ex-Enron that was part of the ""cost cutting  measures"" implemented in early December.  One of the people I have spoken  during my job search is Mark Kierlanczyk from AON.  Mark suggested you  might be someone I could contact and talk to briefly about my job  search.
 
In general terms, I am looking for a job in finance  or structuring with an international company.  My ideal job would be one  that involved a mix of finance and origination for an international energy or  petroleum company, however I am very flexible.  Obviously, the market is  not real strong right now, especially in Houston, but I was hoping to ask  you if you have some ideas of how I might best proceed.
 
I am sure you are quite busy, but I would welcome a  moment to talk to when you have a couple of minutes.  (I have enclosed a  copy of my resume just to let you know where I have been...)
 
Many thanks,

We have backup tapes for deleted email.  David Cohen is aware of this and in fact we are following Wilmer Cutler's advice on all of these issues.  Britt's message is in response to a recently-received subpoena and is a precaution until we can speak with the Wilmer lawyers.

It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
complained to me about the same problem.

I hope you can look into.

Vince
 

 ",David Cohen Vince,,Britt the Special Committee
1543,"Hi Kate,

Firstly it was very useful to hold the informal discussion with him.  Sharad 
seemed hesitant due to the offer not being what he expected.  He asked me 
some questions about the ""bonus culture"" at Enron and suggested that it was 
not as good as at investment banks that he is interviewing with.  I sold him 
on the value he can extract from the excellence within the Research Group and 
the ability to join a growing organisation at a critical point in, but he 
still seemed reticent saying that he ""needs time"" which I understood to mean 
that he was looking for a better offer elsewhere.  He is a great candidate 
and it would be a real shame to lose him, given the difficulty of getting 
good candidates.

I discussed this with Vince and given how much we need him in Research in 
London and Vince agreed to discuss the possibility of an element of guarantee 
or sign on to help him make the right decision.

I think Vince will call you or Dale to discuss this.

Regards,

Anjam

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

US FERC Chairman Vows Action By Dec On Western Pwr Woes
? 
10/05/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will 
act no later than December in response to power capacity and volatility 
problems that plagued Western power markets this year, Chairman James Hoecker 
said Thursday. 
Hoecker, after appearing before the Senate Energy Committee, told reporters 
that he expected the results of an expedited staff investigation of the 
matter to be forwarded to the commission before the month is out. 
The commission will ""take serious action"" in response to the staff report 
""before the holidays,"" he said, without elaborating. 
Before the panel, Hoecker said he expected the commission to act in response 
to the staff's nationwide probe of problems besetting competitive wholesale 
markets before the end of this year. The staff report on the nationwide 
investigation is due Nov. 1. 
In meeting with reporters after the hearing, Hoecker appeared to indicate 
that the response to the Western market woes could come sooner than December. 
Hoecker outlined the tentative timetable after the Senate hearing into 
concerns the Pacific Northwest is becoming increasingly prone to power supply 
shortages in the coming years. 
The Northwest Power Planning Council projects that by 2003 the regions runs a 
one in four risk of a power shortage - and resulting grid blackouts or 
brownouts - during peak summer and winter demand periods as demand outstrips 
supply. 
In order to lessen that 25% risk to an acceptable 5%, the council determined 
the region would need an additional 3,000 megawatts of new generation 
capacity, either installed or imported from elsewhere. 
The hearing featured testimony from the Bonneville Power Administration and 
others regarding how California's grid capacity problems this summer have had 
an adverse affect on the region in terms of price volatility. 
Prepared testimony from BPA featured a graph illustrating that the region's 
spot market prices during the two years prior to California's power market 
restructuring never exceeded $50 per megawatt-hour, and typically were well 
below that level. 
Since the California power exchange began operating in May 1998, spot market 
volatility markedly increased into a price spike this summer in excess of 
$200 per megawatt-hour. 
But another key factor in the Pacific Northwest's problems was dry weather 
that depressed available hydropower generation from the region's massive 
complex of federally owned dams, said Stephen Oliver, BPA's vice president of 
bulk power marketing and transmission services. 
The difference between a wet year and a dry year is 5,000 megawatts of power 
generation capacity, Oliver told the committee. 
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who chaired the hearing, elicited from Oliver 
that operational changes mandated to aid migration of salmon and other 
endangered fish cost the system another 1,000 megawatts of capacity. 
""At this point, the pricing problems in California and the Northwest appear 
to be related,"" he said, citing near-record warm weather in the region and 
lower-than normal hydropower availability. 
Additionally, Hoecker attributed the region's price volatility to 
California's ""very high reliance on the spot market."" 
The supplies of power in the U.S. West are ""simply inadequate,"" Hoecker said. 
The picture painted by the hearing testimony served in contrast to the 
""rumbling"" of officials in California that imports of federal hydropower from 
the Pacific Northwest were contributing to California's market problems, 
noted Sen. Gordon Smith R-Ore. 
""It is the structure of (California's) market that has created the problem,"" 
said Smith, noting, too, that the state's discouragement of new power plant 
capacity has contributed to the problem. 
""It looks like the markets have gone haywire,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., 
who attributed the problems to deregulated power markets. He vowed to fight 
any congressional deregulation legislation that threatens to raise power 
costs in the Pacific Northwest.

	Price caps will not solve the problem
	
	By Adrian Moore and Lynn Kiesling 
	April 19, 2001 
	The drumbeat is again sounding for a return to wholesale price caps in 
California's electricity market. While well intentioned, such a move would be 
a grave mistake. 
	Price controls have a history of distorting markets where competitive prices 
are possible, leading to shortages of supply, inadequate investment, 
over-consumption, and a myriad of other problems. In the case of California's 
electricity crunch, a return to price caps would only increase the threat of 
blackouts, as the supply of electricity would not keep pace with California's 
appetite for power. Unfortunately, state leaders pushing for price caps 
ignore history's lessons and seem destined to repeat past mistakes. 
	California already experimented with price caps and it was a dismal failure. 
As California's wholesale power prices rose rapidly in the spring of 2000, 
the state Independent System Operator (ISO) quickly imposed a price cap. As a 
result, the amount of power supplied to the state decreased as suppliers 
pursued more lucrative opportunities elsewhere, selling their power in states 
without price caps. In fact, imported electricity declined 33 percent in 2000 
from the previous year. 
	Consumer prices in two-thirds of the state were not affected and consumers 
did not reduce demand. Scarcity turned into outright shortages. ISO staffers 
spent much of their time rounding up power to keep the lights on hour by hour 
rather than tending to the needs of the grid. As supplies continued to fall, 
the ISO eventually lifted the caps to avert blackouts. 
	When a similar situation occurred across the Midwest in 1998, policy-makers 
pursued a dramatically different course which resulted in a dramatically 
different outcome. Policy-makers let market prices rise to attract both power 
and investment to the region, and now new power plants are being built. 
	So, if price caps are not the solution, what is? 
	California must choose between two directions for its electricity market to 
move out of its current dysfunctional state: a state takeover of the market, 
which is the direction Gov. Gray Davis' policies are leading, or a transition 
to a deregulated market with real choices for customers. Given the success of 
deregulating electricity generation in states like Pennsylvania and Texas, 
California should pursue the latter course. But the transition will not be 
easy. 
	First and foremost, California must articulate a vision of moving toward 
competition that will encourage new suppliers to enter the market. Too many 
state leaders are offering isolated policy ideas and conflicting proposals 
that do not inform the market in what direction policy is moving and what end 
state is sought. In other cases, the state is hanging a ""business not 
welcome"" sign on the door by scaring off would-be suppliers with high-pitched 
rhetoric and threats of state takeovers. 
	Once a clear vision is laid out, California will need to move toward a system 
where consumers pay market prices for electricity, as this is the only way to 
ensure that demand does not outpace supply. But this move will inevitably 
cause some transition pains. Laying out a clear plan for this transition will 
make it easier for the public to deal with. 
	The state also can encourage utilities to implement real-time pricing and 
metering so consumers can adjust their use of electricity as prices change. 
Again, by providing more information, customers are better able to manage 
this transition. 
	But the state should ensure that utilities do not simply pass all of their 
previous losses onto consumers through increased prices. The utilities helped 
contribute to the problem and must shoulder some of the costs. 
	Finally, if the state is going to move to a truly competitive market, 
utilities must be free to purchase power competitively. Rather than trying to 
oversee every transaction through a central pool, the state should encourage 
a voluntary, independent competitive exchange and develop bidding rules that 
attract both buyers and sellers, and enable utilities to purchase long-term 
contracts at lower prices. 
	Granted, the electricity crisis is no simple problem that the state can solve 
with the stroke of a pen or public speech about the need for conservation. 
Without a doubt, it is going to cause some pain. 
	But beyond the short-term difficulties,? California can still emerge? with a 
robust,? reliable power supply? that encourages new investment,? empowers 
consumers to choose? providers of their choice,? and lowers the cost of the 
fuel? our state's high-tech economy runs on.? A return to price caps? would 
all but eliminate? that prospect and shatter California's track record? as a 
forward-looking source of new ideas.

Pennsylvania 9 Special Election - May 15, 2001 - Representative Bud Shuster
(R) - resigned

Candidates: Bill Shuster (R) - son of incumbent, auto dealer
Scott Conklin (D) - county commissioner from Centre County


It is time for PACs to gear up and take notice of the special election being
held in PA 9.

Bill Shuster's pro-business stance results directly from his numerous years
of insight into the business world.  For the past decade he has owned a
small business in his district.  Prior to owning his own automobile
dealership, he spent years immersed in the auto industry.  He worked for a
supplier in Michigan for a number of years, and he also served as regional
manager for Goodyear in the Washington metro area.

In his BIPAC candidate interview, Mr. Shuster proved that he was very
knowledgeable of the issues that are most important to the business
industry.  His stance on health care, trade issues, market issues,
environmental regulation, and tax reform all were cohesive to the objectives
business hopes to accomplish in the 107th Congress.

Despite the fact that this should be a landslide win with a Republican
running in a Republican district, you will more than likely see a very
competitive race.  There is a weakened Republican base due to competing
factions within the state Republican Party.

The Supreme Decree will also allow Transredes=01, rate case, financing prog=

Detailed Report

This is a significant development in the Bolivian regulatory arena.  The=20
Supreme Decree, establishing a new tariff methodology for natural gas=20
transportation in Bolivia, was signed by President Banzer and was published=
=20
in the official gazette on Wednesday.  We officially learned about it=20
yesterday upon receipt of a certified copy.  The new methodology and=20
regulations are now in effect. =20

The decree provides for full recovery of Transredes' gas deferred account=
=20
over the next twenty years via a surcharge on ALL volumes exported from=20
Bolivia, whether transported by Transredes or not.  The magnitude of the ga=
s=20
deferred account is much greater than anticipated due primarily to severe=
=20
export shortfalls as compared to projected export volumes.  This is due in=
=20
large part to delays in the development of the Brazilian market and to=20
expiration of gas sales and export agreements between Bolivia and Argentina=
=20
(in 1999). Please see the attached graph comparing the volumes projected by=
=20
the Bolivian government to set transitory tariffs, prior to privatization,=
=20
with the actual volumes transported. =20

The gas deferred account is estimated to be approximately US$101 million=20
(plus approximately US$ 60MM for the hydrocarbon liquids deferred account,=
=20
giving a total of US$161MM).  Please see attached Gas Deferred Account and=
=20

The recovery mechanism for the gas deferred account represents the mitigati=

of a significant exposure that existed at the time we acquired the company:=

the transportation concessions are nonexclusive and producers have the=20
explicit right in the Hydrocarbon Law to build their own (bypass) pipelines=

yet the deferred account recovery mechanism placed the burden of recovery=
=20
solely on the transportation tariffs of Transredes.  The change in=20
regulations not only secures recovery of these amounts in a commercially=20
viable manner but will dis-incentivize threatened bypasses.

In the future, Transredes will also be able to fully recover all of its=20
prudently incurred costs and rate of return via tariffs charged for=20
transportation on the domestic and export oil concessions, and the export g=
as=20
concession.  We believe that the tariff mechanism for the domestic gas=20
concession may require additional detail work.  The mechanism provides for =
a=20
ceiling rate of US$0.41 for transportation in the domestic concession and a=
=20
surcharge on all export volumes of US$0.03. These tariff components will no=
t=20
be sufficient to recover the costs and rate of return contemplated by the=

e=20
no impediment to collecting the revenue shortfall in the Transredes export=
=20
gas tariff.  The regulatory team will continue trying to ""firm up"" this=20

The Supreme Decree will also allow Transredes' rate case to move forward. =

best thing to do to move ahead regarding the old unrecovered cash calls 
(""joint interest billings"") was to file an arbitration proceeding and get an 
objective  third party to settle the issue.  As you know, Reliance and ONGC 
owe EOGIL approximately  $7.1 and $10.3 million, respectively (including 
interest on non-payment).  The arbitration notices reflected only the 
non-payment numbers which are $5.8 and $7.3 million for RIL and ONGC 
respectively.   We finalized the drafting and dated the notices on July 29th 
and we delivered the official notice during business hours Monday July 31, 
2000.  This was the final step in a very long effort to resolve this issue in 
other means, but as I noted to the OOC after the June meetings this was the 
only solution in the end.   While nobody likes to file arbitration, the good 
news is in the end all parties seen this as the only solution and as best as 
I can tell, at least internally ONGC and Reliance support this decision.  If 
the issue gets external, I don't know how any of the parties will respond.

Calif. Senate Panel To Cite Reliant, Enron For Contempt

07/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Wednesday.) 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee Wednesday voted to 
cite Reliant Energy (REI) with contempt because the company has refused to 
provide documents for an investigation into wholesale electricity prices in 
the state, said committee Chairman Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana.
The committee also voted to forward a contempt charge for Enron Corp (ENE) to 
the full Senate, where it will be voted on. If the charge is approved, the 
Senate will vote on punishment, which could include hefty fines or 
incarceration of executives. 
Talks between Enron and committee attorneys Monday seemed to indicate the 
company would agree to committee demands, but since then it has become clear 
the company doesn't plan to comply, Dunn said. 
""If you had asked two days ago I'd have said we are cautiously optimistic 
about Enron. Now I'm pessimistic about it. We felt they were indicating to us 
a willingness to do what the other generators were willing to do, but the 
bottom line is that they are not, despite their cooperative-sounding words. 
We are no closer to them coming into compliance than we were a week ago,"" 
Dunn said. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation is requesting 
that Reliant and Enron provide 16 kinds of documents related to market 
behavior, rent a depository for the documents, and sign the committee's 
version of a confidentiality agreement. Both generators have refused to meet 
those demands, Dunn said. 
The committee will drop its contempt charges at any time before a full Senate 
vote if either generator agrees to its requests. 
A report detailing Enron's contempt charge will be sent to the full Senate on 
Thursday for introduction, but is expected to be referred to the Senate Rules 
Committee for review before a floor vote. 
Dunn said he didn't know how long the report would be considered in the Rules 
Committee, but he will ""certainly push them to do it as soon as possible."" 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company ""will continue to negotiate"" 
with the committee. 
Legislators are scheduled to begin a monthlong break Friday, but aren't 
certain that will happen because they still need to pass a budget bill and 
are trying to approve a bill to rescue Edison International (EIX) unit 
Southern California Edison before leaving. 
Dunn said it would take a few days to prepare a report on Reliant's contempt 
charge. 
""We may not be able to forward that report to the Senate floor until the day 
we get back from recess,"" Dunn said. 
No one at Reliant could be immediately reached for comment. 
The committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity 
generators for contempt, but all eventually agreed to provide the requested 
information. 
A Reliant spokesman said later that the company's main difference with the 
committee centered on the signing of the confidentiality agreement. Reliant 
would rather the committee secure a protective order before the company turns 
over the requested documents, said spokesman Richard Wheatley. 
""We respectfully decline to waive our objections, because we have a lot of 
trade secrets and proprietary information at stake,"" he said. 
When asked if the company would take legal action against the committee, 
Wheatley said Reliant was ""keeping all options open."" 
""But, really, we hope to work this out on an informal basis,"" Wheatley said. 
""We don't think this is that big of a stumbling block."" 
Enron filed suit against the committee last week over objections to its 
subpoena of certain financial documents, and said at hearings last week that 
it may sue over its contempt charge as well.

THE FINAL WORD 
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have 
been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.
They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, 
California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile 
California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as 
the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' 
power supplies. 
Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, 
power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These 
might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as 
hang-glide. California was going to rely on ""negawatts"" - dramatic power 
conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity 
that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a 
bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. 
With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms 
wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough 
to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation 
is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. 
Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they 
won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, 
and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly 
compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was 
wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state 
utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to 
Californians whine about electricity deregulation. 
There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission 
merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to 
meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, 
electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They 
were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden 
to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices 
were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. 
This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter 
what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, 
and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, 
purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light 
your house. You're in California. 
Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every 
dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the ""Information Economy"" is 
centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a 
yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold 
weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the 
free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California 
utilities to go $12 billion into the red. 
California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini 
beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed 
creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He 
threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called 
for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld 
electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and 
community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy 
independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded 
like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. ""Everyone should understand 
that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I 
have to,"" Davis declaimed. 
""Take"" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into 
some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because 
the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, 
Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the 
legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. 
Californians want to snatch that money back. ""Consumer advocates around 
California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning 
investments to their shareholders,"" reported the January 31 Washington Post. 
""They took the money and ran,"" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to 
Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and 
the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill 
authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. 
But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term 
power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The 
hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let 
the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. 
It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too.

We have made substantial progress just this week.  We will need to be 
diligent to determine which amendments will be offered in July and to guard 
against those we oppose.  Commerce Committee members are continuing their 
meetings this evening to further plan the upcoming mark-up.

The Senate Reliability bill will likely not be considered until Congress 
reconvenes in July.  Several Democrat Senators have now placed holds.  Under 
the Senate Rules, just one Member can block bill consideration under the hold 
process.  At this point, the hold is process vs. substance.

1723,"I reviewed the ECAR filing.  ECAR is requiring Enron to agree to use it as an 
ECAR control area.  I generally think it is a good filing and of importance 
because it is one of the first times that any reliability requirement of a 
region has been filed at FERC (ECAR asks FERC to balance commercial needs, 
reliability, equity, legal and policy objectives).  The compensation between 
ECAR control areas is meant to discourage Cinergy-type stealing from the 
grid.  It is mandatory for ECAR and ECAR invites other regions to 
participate.  

Inadvertant interchange (II) will be calculated over one hour.  The NERC 
performance subcomm. will balance the II to establish long and short 
parties.  Based on a proportional allocation, the short party will pay the 
long party its top incremental cost (highest purchase price or generation 
price for power) + 10% penalty.  A $15/MW offset is used as the price of 
power repaid in kind to the interconnected system based on existing NERC 
settlement procedures.  Price information is confidential.

The ECAR dispute resolution procedure is applicable (binding ADR is 
voluntary).  Parties retain the right to go directly to FERC.

Lloyd -- Are you OK with the specifics?

I do not see any reason to protest this.  EPSA wants to use the $15 offset to 
show what may be reasonable for generator interconnects and I am discussing 
it with EPSA.  We should file a routine intervention (to obtain pleadings, 
orders, etc.)  Interventions are due Friday, May 5.

Rick:  Per your request, please find the one page description of how the 
Washington D.C. office prioritizes both human and financial resources while 
fitting within the Enron budget process.   I have attached our 1999 
activities report which illustrates the process described below.  

Congress operates in a two year cycle while the Administration operates in a 
four or eight year cycle.  Thus, it is necessary for our prioritization to 
focus on the long term.  Within the context of the Congressional and 
Administration's Calendars, our office determines and communicates doable 
priorities based upon the environment in which we operate.  In addition, we 
actively work behind the scenes and commit resources to affect and change 
this environment.

 On an annual basis, we communicate federal legislative and global 
opportunities which we believe affect our operations via briefings to Steve 
Kean, who along with our assistance, submits our proposed goals to the Enron 
Management Committee,  Global CEO's , individual operating company heads and 
heads of key divisions.  Many dialogues and briefings occur resulting in goal 
adjustments and additions.  During this dialogue, we advise on possible new 
corporate strategies based upon political realities and communicate necessary 
resources required in order to achieve the legislative successes.  

Once this vetting process is complete (December-January timeframe), and the 
Management Committee prioritizes the federal Corporate goals, we submit our 
budget and assure this budget directly correlates to the necessary resources 
(both human and financial) detailed and allocated to meet these priorities.  
(Note:  the budget process usually occurs in the August-October timeframe).  
On the financial side, we keep current as to the rates and the expertise 
available on the market, as well as, track potential conflicts of interest.   
It's our job to know our environment and to lay out strategy.  On an annual 
basis, we adjust our resources which can include dropping some issues, 
reassigning personnel, hiring or letting go necessary outside counsel, etc.  

We remain mindful that in order to achieve legislative success, it is 
necessary to follow long-term planning so as to allow for us to build 
credibility, keep important political relationships viable and, ultimately, 
place us in the best possible political position to achieve success. 

Our budget does its best to recognize that the Congressional process can be 
unpredictable and that Congress reacts to fast occurring events and public 
reaction.   It is rare when we have not foreseen some form of a potential 
issue; thus, we always operate within budget.  An example of a contingency 
issue would be India setting off a nuclear device, a possibility we had 
accounted for yet could not possibly exactly predict nor could we predict the 
fall-out and precise Corporate impact.  However,we were still able to budget 
for possible permutations for such an occurrence and make adjustments as 
needed in order to meet our goals and stay within our budget.  Based upon the 
experience of the people in our office, we have been very successful in 
anticipating these type of occurrences.

Our report details our 1999 results and projects Enron priorities for 2000 
although neither the President's State of the Union address which outlines 
the Executive Branch's legislative agenda for 2000 nor the Republican 
Congressional response and 2000 Congressional legislative agenda has as of 
yet been delivered nor finalized.

Governor, Utility In War Of Words 
Davis furious as PG&E defends bankruptcy filing

N223519.DTL 
California's energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as Gov. Gray Davis and 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. traded barbs over who is to blame for the 
bankruptcy of the state's largest utility. 
In a series of tit-for-tat statements, each side laid claim to the moral high 
ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith. 
The governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews in 
response to The Chronicle's report Saturday that PG&E awarded $50 million in 
bonuses and raises to 6,000 employees just hours before Friday's bankruptcy 
filing. 
""PG&E's management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed,"" 
Davis said in a brief statement Saturday night. 
In a testy reply, PG&E countered that ""instead of focusing all his attention 
on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worsening energy crisis, the 
governor has launched a campaign-style attack on our company."" 
PG&E said Davis was criticizing ""thousands of men and women who have worked 
tirelessly and professionally through this crisis"" and concluded that 
""California would be far better served if the governor turned his attention 
to the crisis at hand."" 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, fired back yesterday: ""PG&E 
waged a public relations war on Friday. If they're looking for somebody to 
blame, they should look in the mirror."" 
Maviglio also said the governor was concentrating on reaching a final accord 
with Southern California Edison Co. for the state to purchase the cash- 
strapped company's power lines for nearly $2.8 billion. 
A last round of talks was scheduled to be held last night. 
""There are a few remaining details to be worked out, but it seems pretty 
close,"" Maviglio said, adding that an announcement of the deal could come as 
early as today. 
""The governor is spending his time negotiating with a responsible utility,"" 
he said. 
Along with the Edison deal, Davis spent the weekend huddling with energy 
advisers and lawyers trying to come up with an appropriate response to PG&E's 
bankruptcy bombshell. 
Efforts to stabilize California's dysfunctional electricity market suddenly 
have become much more complex. 
NOT MUCH CHANGED
Nevertheless, while PG&E's bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect 
of California's long-drawn-out energy mess, at the end of the day, it doesn't 
really change a thing. 
Consider: 
-- PG&E's financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility 
from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs. That rate 
freeze and sky-high electricity prices remain in place. 
-- California's energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not 
having built any major power plants for the past 12 years. PG&E's bankruptcy 
does nothing to affect that precarious situation. 
-- PG&E's foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that 
electricity demand is outpacing available supply. California consumers still 
face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer. 
""The crux of the problem is still the same,"" said Loretta Lynch, president of 
the state Public Utilities Commission. ""We face the same challenges we did 
before PG&E filed for bankruptcy."" 
She added, however, that PG&E's bankruptcy ""increases the uncertainty."" 
The utility doesn't see it that way. 
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said California's energy woes are no more uncertain 
now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with Davis to 
find an equitable solution to the state's troubles. 
""California remains in an energy crisis,"" he said. ""As we head toward summer, 
resources are going to be very tight."" 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
In the short run, consumers will notice no change whatsoever. Bankruptcy 
protection will allow PG&E to continue operating as usual while the company's 
creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills. 
Longer term, there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will 
soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with PG&E that conditions for lifting the 
rate freeze were met a year ago and that $9 billion in subsequent expenses 
must be borne by consumers. 
How much people's bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is 
structured. It would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing 
fees, 
but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost 
over a number of years. 
The big question mark now is how PG&E's bankruptcy will affect various 
political and legislative measures intended to keep California's lights on. 
The state's attempt to purchase PG&E's power lines is obviously finished, 
although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court. 
Meanwhile, the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the 
transmission systems of Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego utility -- 
although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be 
determined. 
""Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra 
and not PG&E?"" asked state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San 
Francisco. ""I don't know the answer to that."" 
A final accord with Edison this week would validate PG&E's apparent concerns 
that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy 
filing if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with Edison was 
unveiled. 
The Chronicle quoted PG&E insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to 
file for bankruptcy had been made early last week, even though senior company 
officials said the move followed the governor's Thursday night speech on 
solving California's energy issues. 
One reason PG&E opted to file on Friday morning was because a final deal with 
Edison was expected at any time, observers said. 
Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, noted that if PG&E 
had filed for bankruptcy after Edison came to terms with the state, ""they 
would be seen as a spoiler."" 
ENSUING CONFUSION
In any case, PG&E's surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for 
footing in the changed political landscape. 
Consumer advocates watched with dismay yesterday as the state's political and 
corporate powers slugged it out for supremacy. 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San 
Francisco, said all this finger-pointing will do nothing to ensure that 
Californians have ample supplies of electricity this summer. 
""These guys should grow up and come up with a situation that works for the 
public,"" she said.

Federal Reserve Board

Release Date: March 20, 2001 

For immediate release 


The Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting today decided to lower its 
target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 5 percent. In a 
related action, the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in 
the discount rate to 4-1/2 percent. 
Persistent pressures on profit margins are restraining investment spending 
and, through declines in equity wealth, consumption. The associated backup in 
inventories has induced a rapid response in manufacturing output and, with 
spending having firmed a bit since last year, inventory adjustment appears to 
be well underway. 
Although current developments do not appear to have materially diminished the 
prospects for long-term growth in productivity, excess productive capacity 
has emerged recently. The possibility that this excess could continue for 
some time and the potential for weakness in global economic conditions 
suggest substantial risks that demand and production could remain soft. In 
these circumstances, when the economic situation could be evolving rapidly, 
the Federal Reserve will need to monitor developments closely. 
The Committee continues to believe that against the background of its 
long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the 
information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward 
conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. 
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved 
requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of all twelve Reserve Banks.

1752,"Earlier today, the New York Public Service Commission released a 122 page 
draft report prepared by its staff evaluating the NYISO. The report concludes 
that the ISO must pursue a wide range of operational reforms and other 
consumer safeguards to ""ensure a more efficient and stable electric market 
that will better protect consumers from dramatic price increases."" The report 
culminates a months-long investigation begun by the PSC last summer in 
response to problems and price run-ups in the wholesale market.

The major recommendations in the Report, some of which have already surfaced 
in recent ISO Committee meetings, would be devastating to a competitive 
wholesale market and would largely reregulate prices in New York. They 
include the following (taken directly from the PSC's Press Release):

Reforming rules and procedures to improve the efficiency of the market and 
minimize opportunities for market manipulation, or ""gaming,"" by owners of 
electricity generating facilities;
Initiating a $150 per megawatt hour price cap on generators to maintain 
reasonable market clearing prices;
Creating a ""circuit-breaker"" mechanism that will prevent market power abuses 
at levels below $150/MWH;
Lowering price thresholds significantly to allow the NYISO to step in more 
quickly to investigate and mitigate price spikes;
Granting the NYISO retroactive refund authority to return to consumers gains 
that generators improperly derive from market power abuse; and,
Creating a strong deterrent against price abuses by penalizing generators who 
repeatedly use improper tactics to raise prices above competitive levels.

The NYPSC, of course, has no legal authority to impose any of these 
recommendations. However, they are likely to muster support from the 
Transmission Owners, governmental entities and loads, that usually control 
enough votes to just  pass a motion at an ISO Committee. This will set up a 
confrontation with the ISO Board, which is walking a delicate tightrope 
between maintaining its independence and supporting a competitive wholesale 
market on the one hand, and dealing with the politics of a hostile 
Administration in New York. Last summer, as you may recall, the Board 
rejected the $1000 bid cap pushed through by the PSC, voting instead for a 
$1300 cap. That action was set aside by FERC, which reimposed the $1,000 
level and then made it applicable in New England as well so that there would 
be consistency among the three Northeast ISOs (PJM already had the $1,000 
cap.) 

Thus, whether NY follows the lead of California is likely to be determined by 
FERC, and it will have to carefully consider the consistency concerns it 
raised last summer in ultimately deciding whether it's OK for New York to set 
price caps below its neighboring ISOs.

seating assignments as approved by senior management.  The construction is 
scheduled to be completed on February 9, and we'll be able to effect our 
moves the following Monday, February 12.  

The move paperwork will be handled as one complete request.  You may be 
contacted for your social security number, current location, etc. if we don't 
already have that information.

On another note, a couple of people have voiced complaints about the air 
quality on the 47th floor.  The air filters have been replaced with high 
density, thicker filters which should make a significant improvement.  The 
Facilities group will also perform some additional testing to check our air 
quality.

If you'll be out of the office on Monday and need help getting your desk 
packed, please let Elizabeth know by Thursday, 2/8.

1767,"Dear Mr Kean,

I am writing to you following a suggestion from Edith Terry (in Enron's DC
office) that I introduce myself to you with respect to prospective
employment with Enron. I will be permanently relocating to the United States
just prior to my marriage in Michigan this July and am looking to continue
my career in the energy sector. In particular, I have a strong interest in
the energy revolution taking place in the US, both on the commercial and
regulatory side and I would enjoy working for organisations, such as Enron,
that are leading this revolution. Edith suggested that you may be in a good
position to suggest opportunities within Enron for which I may be suitable.

I am currently based in Tokyo as the Australian energy representative to the
Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC), where I have developed a strong
knowledge of the Asia Pacific energy market. In this position I have been
closely involved in the development of the APEC Energy Demand and Supply
Outlook, as well as ongoing research in the fields of energy efficiency,
natural gas development and energy pricing. Moreover, as part of my work
with APERC I have maintained a close contact with APEC Energy Working Group
activities, including the APEC Energy Business Network.

Prior to my appointment at APERC, I worked at the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) in Canberra. During my term at
ABARE, I was closely involved in the development of the economic research
underlying Australia's position for the Kyoto climate change conference, and
also in the analysis of APEC (Asia Pacific) energy markets.

For you information, I have enclosed a brief resume which summarises my
background qualifications and experience.
Knowing that you have a busy schedule I would be most grateful for any
advice or assistance you are able to offer.

Yours sincerely,

1785,"I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for 
Bush.  I think the electricity section needs some additions though.  There is 
not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and 
power lines -- its largely a state and local decision.  Further, the problem 
has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to 
utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to 
opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Once utilities are in the 
open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the 
grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to 
connect to the grid.  The answer is open access, so power can get from where 
it is to where it is needed.  This has been clear for a long time, yet the 
current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their 
authority to make this happen.  The result: spiking prices and reliability

they give us ideas for humor and personalization.  A question is whether this 
would work for internal audiences such as all-employee meetings as well as 
external ones.  Once we understand their methodology and capabilities, we 
might find we can do some of this ourselves, and we would consult with them 
on an as-needed basis for future presentations.

***   CONFIDENTIAL   ***

Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I 
recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to 
understand those reasons).

The original group had 3 meetings between January and March.  The initial 
group consisted of:   
One of our initial directions was to form subgroups with specific tasks, and 
to give people across different parts of the organization a chance to work 
together.  This was organized as: 

Beginning in April, a new subgroup was formed of individuals that had 
individual responsibility for areas where EES might be active 
internationally, and consisted of:  
Rob Hemstock  (Non USA North America)
Amr Ibrahim  (Caribbean)
Luiz Maurer  (South America)
Thane Twiggs  (India)
Mike Grimes (Pacific Rim)
Kyran Hanks (Europe)
Harry Kingerski (USA)

The new subgroup, in effect, replaced the larger group and we have worked 
together through the year as specific, focused needs arose.  I have not 
reconvened the larger group for these two specific reasons:
1) it was clear that, to the extent there were EES international needs, they 
were already being met by Mark Schroeder in Europe and Luiz Maurer in Brazil 
(Scott Porter of EES, in Brazil, made it quite clear he was very happy with 
Luiz.)
2) International EES could not articulate a need from Regulatory Affairs that 
was not being met.  Mark Mueller from EES was very helpful in our initial 
discussions but he said EES was several months away from any viable business 
strategy or regulatory needs.  We were a group ""in search of a client"". 

Individuals in the (April) subgroup have been in touch with regional 
commercial counterparts and we talk as needed.


What did the group accomplish?


Specific products that were developed and shared with the group:

1) A presentation put together by Gloria Ogenyi on regulatory ""Lessons 
Learned"" that can have commercial value, and it includes slides used from 
some commercial presentations from EES USA.      
2)  A table put together by Kyran Hanks that shows regulatory attributes by 
country for Europe.    

3) Information sharing.  It was a good way for people across the organization 
and on different continents to get to know one another.  The contacts made 
were valuable.  (Personally, I know it was valuable for me to say in a couple 
of customer presentations, that Enron is the only retailer where I could, 
when faced with a problem, instantly have people on the phone with experience 
from 5 different continents who could help solve the problem.)


Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?

No, not the larger working group.  I think it is more effective to organize 
activity around specific needs and bring people together to perform the 
function as needed.  It is hard and was hard to keep everybody's attention if 
there is no specific task.


Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future?  
Any changes to the working group process itself?

See above.


Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able 
to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the 
feedback by confidential e-mail to me.  Because the PRC is coming up soon, 
please provide the feedback by December 1. 

Kyran Hanks, Mike Dahlke,  and  Amr Ibrahim were especially helpful in this 
process.  I reviewed Amr in the PEP.  We had high attendance and good 
participation from the rest of the team.  Gloria Ogenyi came in and did a

In response to Terry's comments, I have prepared an outline of what I think 
the Regulatory Risk Managment & Assessment Working Group will do.

Key tasks:

1. assist with the completion of the Regulatory Risk Management Process
 - do we have the right information
 - is the process leading to the right conclusions
 - etc.
2. act as chief liason for my group in Houston with the people in Government 
Affairs throughout the world
 - explain the process
 - explain the purpose
 -  help with questions from Government Affairs people thoroughout the world
3. act as Audit ""device"" for Mitigation plans
 - make sure that the Mitigation plans are followed through on by responsible 
party
4. provide oversight for ""risk"" assumptions
 - act somewhat as a neutral third-party for reasonableness of basic 
assumptions
 - ensure that the broader political context is captured in the modeling
5. other
 - ???

In terms of work load, I would hope that once the process is up and running, 
the work load will be minimal.  Clearly I would like the Working Group to 
stay informed of Enron's current Regulatory Risk position, but I don't think 
that this will be more than some overviews and responses to questions from my 
direct team.

Given this structure, I would hope that people with political knowledge and 
regulatory expertise are included.  For this effort, I need a team of people 
who understand every region of the world (or at least know how to find out 
about a specific country).

I hope this helps.  

Thanks,

State, Northwest trade blame for energy woes 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday,?December 13, 2000 
,2000 San Francisco Chronicle 
California officials have blamed the state's energy woes in part on the 
Pacific Northwest's not having enough extra power to share. 
But in Oregon and Washington, they're blaming California for not coming 
through on a decades-old bargain to supply much-needed electricity in the 
winter in return for the Northwest's juice in the summer. 
If the current power shortages worsen, consumers throughout the West Coast 
face an increasing likelihood of blackouts. 
Until now, California and the Pacific Northwest have enjoyed a mutually 
beneficial power-sharing arrangement whereby shortfalls in one area are made 
up for by surpluses in the other. 
""We've had a traditional reliance on California in the winter,"" said Dulcy 
Mahar, a spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, 
Ore., 
which sells power produced by federal dams in the region. ""Without 
California's electricity, we've had to take some extraordinary steps."" 
Chief among those steps is tapping into dam reservoirs that, in a normal 
year, would be used to generate power next summer. 
As a result, the risk is growing day by day that the Northwest will be unable 
to help meet California's surging energy demand in the months ahead, when 
millions of air conditioners are added to the state's already strained 
electricity system. 
""Next summer is going to be twice as bad as last summer,"" predicted Kellan 
Fluckiger, chief operating officer of the California Independent System 
Operator, which oversees the state's power network. 
""Each summer after that is going to get progressively worse until blackouts 
become a normal part of a hot summer afternoon,"" he said. 
The ISO called a Stage 2 power emergency at 5:10 p.m. yesterday as reserves 
fell once again to dangerously low levels. Power was cut to some voluntary 
users. 
Meanwhile, federal regulators agreed to consider a request from the 
California Power Exchange, which coordinates the state's wholesale power 
market, to restore price caps for electricity rates. A $250-per-megawatt 
limit was lifted by state officials last week. 
On Monday, wholesale power prices spiked as high as $900 and are expected to 
top $1,000 today. Last year at this time, electricity could be bought by 
utilities such as San Francisco's Pacific Gas & Electric Co. for a mere $45 
per megawatt. 
Against this backdrop, California and Pacific Northwest power agencies are 
scrambling to meet demand as a previously complementary relationship falls 
apart. 
""We never saw such a tight demand-supply situation,"" said John Harrison, a 
spokesman for the Northwest Power Planning Council, a four-state body charged 
with balancing energy production with environmental concerns. ""The timing of 
this really caught us by surprise."" 
California and the Northwest recognized years ago that power needs in the two 
regions are completely dissimilar. In California, demand for electricity 
soars in the summer, when all those air conditioners add to the state's 
already considerable energy load. 
In Oregon and Washington, demand climbs in the winter because nearly half of 
all homes are heated with electricity, a reflection of the region's 
historically dirt-cheap power prices. 
More than half of all power in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana 
comes from dams along the Columbia, Snake and other rivers. These include 28 
federally owned dams from which the Bonneville Power Administration sells 
electricity to customers basically at cost. 
For decades, the arrangement worked fine. California helped heat the 
Northwest in the winter, and the Northwest helped cool California in the 
summer. 
This year, however, everything changed. As California stumbled from one 
crisis to another amid a bungled effort to deregulate the power market, 
demand far outpaced available supply and a threat of blackouts has persisted 
since June. 
The state is now grappling with an unprecedented winter power shortage, 
caused in large part by an unusually high number of plants being down for 
scheduled and unscheduled maintenance or because they have exceeded annual 
pollution limits. 
Whereas California normally would be exporting power to other states at this 
time of year, it is now frantically hunting for out-of-state generators that 
can come through in a pinch. 
And without excess California energy supplies making their way across the 
border, power officials in the Northwest are struggling to find enough juice 
to keep homes warm as temperatures plunge this week about 10 degrees below 
normal. 
An arctic cold snap expected to hit last night will only make matters worse. 
According to official projections, the Northwest will come up short next 
month in meeting its power needs by more than 4,000 megawatts -- roughly the 
amount of electricity required to light up four cities the size of Portland. 
Exacerbating the situation is the fact that the region has faced an unusually 
dry winter so far. This has lowered reservoir levels behind dams and 
indicates a smaller-than-normal snowpack in the mountains, which would affect 
rivers in the spring. 
Mahar also said Bonneville and other power providers already were tapping 
into reservoirs to provide additional power through the winter. Unless the 
rain and snow arrive in full fury next month, Mahar said, this almost 
certainly will reduce the Northwest's ability to help meet California's 
energy needs in the summer. 
""Our reservoirs are like savings accounts,"" she said. ""When we cash them out, 
we don't have enough left in the bank."" 
Steve Johnson, executive director of the Washington Public Utility District 
Association, a Seattle trade group representing 28 regional utilities, said 
the shortfall in power from California would force the Northwest to improvise 
for weeks to come. 
""We're trying to buy energy every place we can find it,"" he said. 
Like many observers north of the border, Johnson is dismayed by California's 
efforts to deregulate the state's electricity market. ""We think you made a 
terrible mess of it,"" he said. 
And now, he pointed out, California's troubles have become a headache for 
other states as well -- with no end to the problem in sight. ","David Lazarus Wednesday,?December Dulcy

1800,"This past Tuesday, Ron Tapscott, Dwight Larson, Saeed Raja and myself met w/ 
all 5 counterparties from Cristobal (AEP, First Energy, CMS Energy, Detroit 
Edison and Virginia Power - collectively the Alliance Partners) to initiate 
the discussions and process of asset valuations.  Also, attending the meeting 
on behalf of the Alliance Partners was a representative from Arthur Andersen 
who will be assisting them in this process.  AA has also been working with 
the Partners since their own inception of forming an RTO.

Overall the meeting was productive and we focused on both asset valuations as 
well as structural issues.  We itemized a general list of data/info 
(deliverables) that will be necessary to begin the analysis/negotiation 
process.  We also highlighted a list of specific issues related to structural 
aspects which we (ENE) felt were critical path items and have to be addressed.

The Alliance Partners focus is that the combination of operating synergies, 
revenue enhancements, growth and financial engineering for a Pipe/Wire combo 
has to produce significant upside value that the Wires Co can't get on its 
own.  Of the 5 Alliance Partners, it is clear that 3 of them (AEP, First 
Energy and Detroit Edison) are definitely ""in the game"" and serious about 
moving forward.  We're not so sure about either CMS or Va Power.  The primary 
obstacle seems to be both parties apparent reluctance to divulge the level of 
financial/operating information (which they feel is too sensitive of info to 
be shared on an individual basis at this time) necessary to move the deal 
forward.  They did however agree to AA playing the role of an information 
clearinghouse whereby each Alliance Partner can send its individual data to 
AA who in turn will aggregate it into one ""Wires Co.""  Finally, both CMS and 
VP seem to be somewhat ""non-committal"" towards how they would participate 
(i.e., divest, lease, etc...) but AEP, First Energy and Detroit Edison all 
made it very clear that once the group (at least a majority thereof) decides 
to move forward, any entity not divesting would be excluded from subsequent 
discussions, etc... where values, structural issues, etc... are being 
discussed.  They would essentially be treated as a counterparty in an 
ordinary contracting process.

The path forward with action items and deadlines are as follows:

1/7 - ENE is to provide AA with basic GPG financial info pursuant to the list 
we discussed in the meeting (basically, FERC Form 2 data)
1/7 - ENE is also to provide to AA for each of the 5 Alliance Partners, the 
financial info, assumptions, etc... we have used to date in our analysis
1/7 - CMS to decide if they're interested in including their pipes (PEPL and 
TGP)
1/10 - AA is to distribute ENE's assumptions/info to each respective Alliance 
Partner for them to review/confirm/edit (as needed)
1/17 - AA is to have gathered the individual data from each Partner and 
""aggregate"" it into one Wires Co and submit it to all parties including ENE
1/28 - AA is to analyze and quantify the potential operating synergies for 
Wires Co and submit a new ""synergized"" version of Wires Co financial data/info
2/4 - next meeting with ENE and Alliance Partners scheduled in Houston at ENE 
office (Beth Ryan coordinating details)

1801,"On 3/30/98, Aquila filed a complaint at FERC against Entergy that Entergy 
reserved all of the firm import capacity (2000 MW) at four key interfaces, 
even though Entergy did not designate any off-system network resources to 
cover these reservations.  Aquila's transmission requests were denied or 
curtailed causing it to suffer financial losses.  Entergy responded that 
Aquila had a ""fundamental misunderstanding"" of Order No. 888 et seq. and that 
a transmission provider may deny tariff requests, if that transmission 
provider's own reservations ""are based on the legitimate reliability needs"" 
of its bundled retail customers.

Reservation facts:  Entergy posted on its OASIS site that it reserved 2000 MW 
of capacity at its interfaces with TVA (1100 MW), Southern (400 MW), Arkansas 
Electric Coop (250 MW), and Union Electric (250 MW) under the label ""Firm 
Import for Native Load.""  Entergy did not designate network resources in the 
same manner that it required from Aquila and other network customers.  
Entergy explained that its reservations were needed ""to meet the immediate 
reliability needs of the Entergy System and to accommodate native load growth 
over the next few years.""  (Entergy later told FERC that this was needed for 
""current loads"" only--not future growth.)

Entergy argued to FERC that it is able to satisfy its generation reserve 
requirements, while maintaining lower amounts of generating capacity within 
its control area, only because it can rely on the 2000 MWs at issue to reach 
neighboring control areas, therefore this is ""a legitimate reliability 
need.""  Entergy then claimed that Sec. 28.2 of the pro forma tariff (that 
requires a transmission provider, on behalf of its Native Load Customers, to 
designate its network resources in the same manner as any Network Customer) 
does not apply to a utility's uses of its transmission system to serve 
bundled retail customers. 

In a draft order issued today, FERC disagreed with Entergy and found that 
Entergy reserved virtually all of the firm capacity on four key interfaces, 
even though it had no off-system network resources.  Instead, Entergy used 
its firm transmission reservation to purchase power whenever it was 
economical.  Entergy denied all other firm transmission requests and 
entertained non-firm transmission requests only when it was unable to make an 
economic deal for itself.  Even though Entergy is not required to take 
transmission under its tariff for retail load, it is required to designate 
network resources and loads.  The off-system resource must be generation 
owned by the transmission provider or under contract.  

Although FERC found that Entergy violated the OATT and normally the 
transmission should be released, Entergy has now begun to designate network 
resources (these new procedures are pending at FERC).  Aquila also asked FERC 
for its financial losses of $281,000, but FERC said it lacked authority to 
order money damages.  FERC would order refunds of the transmission rate, but 
Aquila did not allege that it paid for services it did not receive.

Interestingly, FERC told Aquila that it could bring this matter up in Entergy 
Power Marketing's currently pending 3 year update of its market-based rates 
stating that  use of the transmission system on a non-preferential basis is a 
fundamental condition for market-based rates.  (Entergy argued against this 
saying that there was no allegation that it had profited.  FERC rejected this 
argument.)  Dynegy has already protested Entergy's 3 year update stating that 
Entergy is exercising market power by limiting new generation through poor 
interconnection procedures and agreements.  Enron filed one sentence support 
of Dynegy's protest.  I think this is why Entergy recently filed its 
interconnection agreement and procedures at FERC.

Comm. Herbert dissented saying that this was a ""technically"" from several 
years ago.

1802,"Good to hear that you're still alive and kicking after your recent world
travels.

You're right about GW -- it wasn't pretty getting there and the big question
will be whether he made himself so ugly that he's too damaged for November.
Honestly, I'm extremely disappointed in a number of ways with the campaign
he's run and especially with some tactical decisions made by Karl and the
rest of the staff who I don't think have served him particularly well. We'll
see if they learned any lessons.

My other buddy, Rick Perry, is going to be in NYC at the end of the month
and I'm helping to raise money for the event. I can't escape.

Excellent choice for vacation. You all will love it. Not only is it great
for us adults, I think your girls will really enjoy it as well. The one
thing I would recommend (before I bring in my file and bore you with too
much) is to try and stay in one or maybe two places and not move to
different hotels. It's easy to do day trips via car or train and it's great
to come back to the same place. Granted, we were there for two weeks and
were staying at a beautiful hillside, 5 bedroom villa with a pool, but it
gives you more flexibility in your schedule, i.e. if you want to take it
easy one day and just walk around the town you're in and have a leisurely
lunch. Off the top of my head (and I will bring in my file) my favorite
places were some of the obvious such as Florence which is good for at least
one if not two full days and Siena, where Sue Mara and her family were there
for the famous horse races in the city square, but also some of the smaller
towns were just as interesting. San Gimignano is famous for its towers that
rise out of the landscape, sort of like the Houston skyline, and do a day
bike ride through the Chianti region and hit at least one winery. We did one
around Montepulciano where we stopped for lunch. There are bike tour groups
that will arrange all of it for you. I would also make the effort to go to
the Tuscan coast and specifically Portifino, one of the most beautiful ports
I've ever seen. And then if you're kids aren't susceptible to car sickness,
I would do the drive along the Chicutira (sp?) coast which is a series of
little fishing villages. This is probably more than you ever wanted to know,
but the more familiar you are with the area before you go over there, the
smoother it will be so I also recommend buying a Fodders, or whatever it's
called. They're well worth it. Also be forewarned that if you rent a car,
they are very small. Fortunately, the Kean family is also small.

Job is going great and settling into big city life very smoothly. Our stock
has been taking a beating thanks in part to your guy, Clinton, and his
interventionists statements that erased $50 billion from the biotech sector
in one day last week. But we'll make up for it when we roll out our cure.

Call if you're up this way. Greetings to everyone on the floor.

By the end of the day, the Treasury had decided to move forward and hold 
another meeting with the CEOs, Governor Davis and various other Government 
officials.  Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video 
conference was set up with two locations:  one at DOE in Washington and one 
in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage.  It was tentatively set up 
for 2:30 pm CST.  I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve 
Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron.

Long-Term Forward Contracts

Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm.  It includes a 
draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products 
required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1.
Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, 
given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California.


Debt and Forebearance

Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday.


QF Contract Reformation

Parties continued discussion
No information was available by COB Friday.

Major Issues

State interest in resolving
State willingness to raise retail rates
Utilties' desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio manager
Willingness to ""call off the dogs"" for the suppliers and to release them from 
legal action
State willingness to offer up sites for power plant development
Ability to reach deal on QF contract reformation


Next Steps

If definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting, 
this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the 
week of Jan 15.

If agreement is reached, a massive amount of work is required immediately, 
such as:
FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 16.
RFO completion and release by Jan 18
Introduction and passage of necessary legislation to be executed by February 
2.
Preparation of contract between utilities and state (probably DWR)
Preparation of formal agreements among the parties on the terms on this 
settlement

1821,"Steve - We were hoping to provide a chart that plotted out the NOx emissions 
from existing fossil fuel generation vs, new cleaner generation.  This chart 
is not quite there.  However, it is a rough aggregate of the NOx generated by 
all of the existing fossil fuel generation over 50 MW in CA.  The data points 
were gathered from the EPA's Acid Rain CEMs (continuous emissions monitoring) 
database.  (I am working on a chart that's message is more clear.) As you 
will see, existing generation is significantly dirtier than what new, 
combined cycle plants would be.  In fact, of the utility units in CA 
reporting under Title IV, there are a number of steam plants with NOx 
emissions of 0.1 lb/MMBtu or in some cases more.  This corresponds to about 1 
lb NOx/MWh compared to 0.056 lb/MWh for a new gas combined cycle plant.  Even 
the cleaner boilers that are at 0.05 lb/MMBtu are 10 times higher than the 
new plants on an output basis.  

In otherwords, Dave Parquet is right that there is a lot of more polluting 
generation on line, while new plants have to meet ever tighter BACT 
requirements.



In the most recent version of SB 28 it looks like there are a lot of 
provisions focusing on the retrofitting of existing generation.  I suspect, 
the regulators are well aware of the discrepancies in emissions and would 
argue that the plants are going to have to clean up in the very near future.  
I am digging for more information on these timelines.

Gus, Marc, and I felt like the main short term fixes/solutions would be:

1.  Expanding the hours of operations for back-up generators.  (As I have 
previously stated, some of the local air districts have increased the 
permitted run hours for emergency generators from 200 to 500 at only 
""essential public services."")  

2.  CA requiring offsetting of emissions at only the ratios required by 
Federal regulations.  In many cases state requirements are more stringent.

3.  The EPA allowing the concept of the pollution mitigation bank - it is 
really going to be an issue of timing - once the CA government has the funds 
to start acquiring offsets they will be able to provide them prior to the 
operation of a new generation facility, However, there is going to be some 
initial lag time where the offsets aren't in the hands of the generation 
operators (which goes against the requirements of the Clean Air Act).

4.  The Feds working with the state and local permitters to create alternate 
sources of emission offsets.  There simply aren't enough in all the air 
districts.  As I stated, in my previous memo the USEPA has allowed, under the 
NOx SIP call, emissions allowances to be given to renewable and energy 
efficiency projects. CA is going to need guidance from the USEPA in how to 
create and count alternate sources of offsets in nonattainment areas.

5.  The USEPA better defining the nonattainment air sheds and pollution 
transportation pathways.  Apparently, there is not a central model of the air 
patterns in CA.  Thus, the 35 local air districts all having different 
requirements about inter-district offsets.

However, the real issues as Dave alluded to in his memo are going to require

1823,"The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no 
day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should 
post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at 
this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is 
fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to 
base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides 
the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission 
is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability 
to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or 
zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY 
City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined ""proxy 
buses.""

While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect 
congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now), 
the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the 
establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use 
their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push 
option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical 
market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.

If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to 
load.  Ideally, the load should have an ""network"" right from the generator to 
their load (or from load to the ""hubs"") in order to have the ability to 
manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use 
customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be 
grouped into logical ""zones"" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted. 
This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes 
critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.  
Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium 
to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced. 

Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market 
like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it 
has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to 
adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for 
lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they 
are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they 
demonstrate continued compliance.

Bottom line -- ""Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.""  Congestion 
does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is 
done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient 
real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the 
generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide 
greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business.  

Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a 
real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on 
non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load 
exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.",Kevin,,The Real Time Energy Market PJM Enron EES ENA NEPOOL FERC

1837,"Dan Walters: Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor?
When Gov. Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. 
All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the ""energy crisis,"" an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. 
When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. 
Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. 
At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. 
Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. 
Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. 
A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. 
That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. 
By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. 
Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. 
Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.",Dan Walters Davis Lynch Gray Davis Loretta Lynch,billions of extra dollars,Public Utilities Commission PUC Lynch Los Angeles Times Davis-Lynch Edison Legislature

(Dan, can you make sure these charts get to Steve?)

Attached are some updated charts that are more accurate with respect to 
Enron's current estimated cost of peakers in California.  Costs are up and, 
to the extent you use these types of charts, you should use these updated 
ones.  If you do not, this information will get attached somehow to our 
November 22 comments.

In general, the higher the cost to build, the worse a price cap looks in 
terms of disincentives to pursue a project.

Background on the Change:

Our origination people  (Chris Calger)  inform us that building a peaker 
plant in California is now more expensive than Enron estimated back in 
August.  These ""August"" numbers were circulated in a presentation by Tim 
Belden and were  filed with the FERC.

The peaker charts to reflect a  25% increase in capital costs.  An increase 
in costs is due to things such as: 

 longer development time (Cal ISO has dragged out the schedule)
 local permitting constraints (sound abatement, strict construction schedules)
 labor costs in California
 emission offset credit costs are higher than previously expected

These higher costs, along with the uncertainty created by price caps, has 
caused Enron to stop pursuing certain peaker, including Pleasanton.  Although 
price caps increases uncertainty and increases the cost of capital, I have 
not updated the charts to reflect a higher cost of capital as a conservatism.

1843,"Deregulation not to blame but Davis is: His inaction allowed a problem to 
become a power, and fiscal, crisis
By Pete Wilson 
(Published June 3, 2001) 

The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of 
hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a 
sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand. Five years ago, when 
deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature 
(and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer, 
including then-Lt. Gov. Gray Davis), California enjoyed an excess of supply 
over demand amounting to some 30 percent. 
Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition; first, to drive 
down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and, 
second, to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new 
generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and 
keep in California all the jobs that it would produce. 
And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in 
applications to build power plants, especially after the effective date of 
the legislation in 1998 and the defeat that year by California voters of 
Prop. 9 (which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation). The total megawattage 
of the filings for 1998 doubled that for 1997. After the effective date 
(March 1998) of the deregulation legislation, AB 1890, and the defeat of 
Proposition 9 (November 1998), removing the threat of repeal, the total for 
1999 was double that of 1998 -- exceeding the 5,000 MW mark in '99 alone. 

Just look at the filings for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 in the California 
Energy Commission graph (above). Far from causing the problem of energy 
shortage, as the Davis administration charges, deregulation caused providers 
to file -- by mid-2000 -- applications to build new power plants that 
promised to add 10,000 megawatts to California's power supply. 
That's why I signed it. 
I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB 1890 -- 
just as I (and every other governor in history) signed other bills which, 
though imperfect, promised significant and needed beneficial change from the 
status quo, which was certainly true of deregulation. 
No one could have anticipated in 1996 the combination of factors -- less 
hydroelectric output in the West, warmer summers, sharply higher electricity 
demand, constraints on natural gas supply -- that turned an electricity 
surplus into an electricity problem by 2000. The reason we will suffer power 
blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction 
allowed a problem to become a crisis. Now the power crisis threatens to 
become a state fiscal crisis. 
Governor Davis has been quoted as saying, ""If I wanted to raise rates, I 
could have solved this problem in 20 minutes."" Sadly, by temporizing on 
needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis, he 
made crisis inevitable. As a result, California bonds have suffered two 
downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies, and he has put in jeopardy state 
spending for parks, schools, transportation and other capital needs. He has 
been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state 
budget. 
The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in 
electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years, which 
gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation, or 
the curtailment of production of natural gas, which led to price spikes in 
recent years. It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting 
agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century. 
It ignored a 1998 warning by the California Energy Commission of possible 
energy shortages by as early as 2000. And when possibility became hard, hot 
reality in San Diego in 2000, it continued to ignore it, putting in place a 
political, palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem. 
Fully a year ago, or earlier had he chosen to do so, Governor Davis could 
have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of 
California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency, including 
explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy. These powers 
include the suspension of statute and regulation. It was this power that I 
used after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 to rebuild and reopen Los 
Angeles' shattered freeways -- just 64 days after their destruction, instead 
of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required 
by law. 
Fully a year ago, Davis could have acted unilaterally, without the 
Legislature, to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investor-owned 
utilities (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) recently complain of but eagerly requested at 
the time of enactment. 
He could have, by decree, suspended the provision that prohibited the 
utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers. 
He could have, by executive order, suspended and truncated the nightmarish 
process required by state law for approval of siting. Had he done so early 
enough, when he might even have made a difference this summer, and done so 
not just with peaker plants but also with large plants, he might have greatly 
accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow 
us to escape from blackouts, power price spikes and the severe job loss and 
economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither 
reliable nor affordable. 
All these actions, Governor Davis could have taken a year ago -- or earlier: 
A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to 
prevent it. He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it. 
Had the governor heeded the early warnings -- about hot weather, or the 
threat of insolvency to the utilities -- and had he acted, using the full 
range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have, he could 
have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become. 
We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast 
enough to avoid blackouts this summer. 
PG&E would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern 
California Edison would not be teetering on the brink. 
Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels. 
The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers' dollars. 
And California's jobs would not be threatened, as they are, by raiders from 
other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California 
employers to their states and steal our jobs. 
The blame game waged by the governor's office adds insult to injury. It will 
provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer. But it 
does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to 
mislead those who are not aware of the real, unhappy facts of California's 
present crisis. 
The honest explanation for it is simple, not rocket science: State government 
cannot ignore the law of supply and demand. It is not the state's 
responsibility to build power plants. But it is its responsibility to create 
a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers 
to do so. Deregulation, even with imperfections that the governor could have 
cured by fiat if the need arose, was a significant advance in achieving that 
incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest. 
The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of 
Governor Davis' failure to act. That is the plain, unhappy truth of the 
matter. I take no joy in saying so. I have been prepared to be helpful to the 
governor during this very serious challenge to our state's well-being, just 
as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition 
39 (the school bond issue) in the most recent election. 
Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him 
then, I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and 
a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in 
order to shift the blame for his own inaction.

1845,"At the close of our very productive meeting yesterday, I promised to
circulate a brief update on California's electricity demand trends; it
appears below as an attachment at the close of a note I circulated
within NRDC earlier today, which I thought would be of interest:

Today should have been a severe test for the California grid:  we had
the third straight day of high temperatures throughout much of the state
and the Southwest (weather forecasts earlier in the week had prompted
warnings of rolling blackouts).  As I write this at 4 pm on Thursday,
average temperatures throughout the entire PG&E system are above 90
degrees.  But peak loads for the day will not reach 40,000 Megawatts,
and reserve margins are comfortable (about 15% at the peak hour).
California's last rolling blackouts occurred six weeks ago (and those
were very modest in scale).  It is far too soon to declare victory, but
these are hopeful signs, and they will help relieve pressure on the
Governor to crank up dirty emergency generators.  NRDC's updated
assessment of recent CA electricity consumption trends (attached again
just in case you've lost it) indicates that demand reductions clearly
are a big part of the reason why things are looking up.  There are
plenty of reasons for continued caution:  the entire West can get much
hotter, hydropower conditions in the Northwest remain awful,  and
complacency could shift demand back up quickly (much of the recent load
reductions represent reversible voluntary actions).

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. moved in the right direction by releasing more detailed financial data and tackling problems at peripheral businesses, but the energy giant still has a way to go to make Wall Street happy, analysts said Wednesday. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Tuesday. The company took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments, measures Enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable with.
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said on Wednesday he was ""not thrilled"" by the announcement during a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. And for good reason. 
Moody's Investors Service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. 
""There appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved,"" Barone said. 
The writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company's operations went some way to appeasing Wall Street after a tumultuous year in which Enron's stock lost about two-thirds of its value, but analysts said they were not about to let Enron off the hook just yet. 
Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters said he remained concerned about Enron's quality of earnings and cash flow. 
Winters said he believed Enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns, but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk, which could adversely affect some of the company's financing arrangements. 
""Problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain, particularly overseas,"" he said. 
One such asset is Enron's 65 percent stake, valued at $1 billion, in the Dabhol power plant project in India, which has been stalled because of a long-running payments dispute with its only customer, a local utility company. 
Enron's stock closed down $1.64, or 4.85 percent, at $32.20 on Wednesday. 
For the year to date the stock is down about 61 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index , which has fallen some 24 percent over the same period. 
Enron was a Wall Street favorite last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the company's broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen sharply this year as sentiment toward broadband soured, new chief executive Jeff Skilling resigned after just six months in the job and wrangling continued over the Dabhol power plant project.

USA: UPDATE 1-RTO seen key to boosting New England power supply.
By Scott DiSavino

10/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the U.S. Northeast hinges, in part, on setting up a Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). 
RTOs are predominantly for-profit groups established to bring all of a region's high-voltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees the interstate wholesale power market, believes RTOs will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers, in turn improving service and driving down rates. 
""If FERC can drive the Northeast RTO to closure in a reasonable period of time, it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation,"" Enron Corp.'s managing director of global government affairs, Rick Shapiro, told Reuters. 
Houston-based Enron is the nation's top energy marketer. 
""How and when the RTO gets implemented will radically impact the market. It's crucial to the development of the market in New England,"" Mirant Corp. spokesman Ray Long told Reuters. 
Energy provider Mirant, of Atlanta, has 1,400 megawatts (MW) of generation in New England. The company is currently adding another 700 MW to its Canal station in Massachusetts. 
""Once we get the permits for Canal, we will reassess whether to proceed with the project. A big part of that assessment will depend on the RTO process,"" Long said. 
THE NORTHEAST RTO 
FERC wants to see four super-regional RTOs created in the U.S. - in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. 
Several regions have taken long strides toward developing RTOs, including a not-for-profit model proposed in the Midwest and rival for-profit plans vying for FERC approval in the West. 
FERC Chairman Patrick Wood, seeking to spur the development of RTOs, favors giving utilities until Dec. 15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market, though the commission has not voted on this plan. 
The Northeast RTO will include New England, New York, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region and possibly parts of eastern Canada. 
FERC said it wants the Northeast RTO to be built on the PJM market platform and to include the best practices of the New England and New York markets. 
PJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and Washington, D.C., is the nation's only fully functioning RTO. 
""The process FERC set in place to establish one RTO in PJM, New York and New England is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market,"" Long said. 
Long said Mirant determined a single Northeast RTO would save more than $440 million annually by eliminating the ""artificial borders that now exist between New York, New England and PJM."" 
An administrative law judge, acting as a mediator for FERC, considered three proposals for creating the Northeast RTO. 
The three plans were proposed by interested parties, including Mirant and Enron, and the region's grid operators - the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) in New York, ISO New England in New England and PJM. 
Last month, the judge asked the FERC to decide who will govern the Northeast RTO and what the timetable is to put the plan in place. The judge favored a plan put forward by the New York ISO and ISO New England. 
""If FERC implements the RTO plan proposed by PJM in 2003, consumers could save $1.5 billion ... $440 million a year ... over the New York/New England plan, which would not be implemented until 2006,"" Long said. 
Under the PJM plan, PJM would overlay its current market model across the entire region, while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets. 
""Although nothing is perfect, PJM is widely accepted as the best market in the region. New York and New England, which are younger markets, are still works in progress with some bugs to work out,"" Enron's Shapiro said.

Enron Seeks Replacement For AGA's Gas Storage Report

10/17/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE), the nation's largest natural gas trading company, isn't ready to let the regular report on U.S. natural gas storage inventory die, a company executive said Tuesday. 
Because the American Gas Association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year, Enron would like to see another organization take over the report, said John Lavorato, president and chief executive of the company's Americas Wholesale Services unit.
Speaking at a meeting with analysts, Lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals. 
Without a regular report on storage gas inventory, the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past, he said. 
The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration publishes monthly data on gas storage, but the information isn't as timely as data the AGA reports each Wednesday. 
The EIA issued its latest gas storage report Oct. 9. It showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of July. The data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities. 
It also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of August and September. Those estimates are generated by a computer model. 
Wednesday's weekly storage report from the AGA will show estimated inventory as of Oct. 12. The AGA estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities. That data is then run through an AGA computer model to generate the report. 
Lavorato said he would like to see the EIA, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America or consultants like PIRA Energy Group, an international energy consulting firm, take over reports on storage inventory. 
INGAA is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. They manage many of the gas storage facilities. 
Lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited, he said. 
He said he thinks the AGA has found itself ""in the middle of something it didn't want to be in."" Originally intended for use within the gas industry, the weekly AGA report has become high-profile, and is even watched by equity markets, he said. 
Some industry participants have criticized the AGA report, wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the AGA. Many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures. 
When the AGA has revised storage figures from previous reports, gas prices have sometimes reacted wildly.

To:  NAM Directors & Director-Nominees:


Wanted you to know that everything is on track for the NAM Fall Board
Meeting at the Monarch Hotel in Washington, DC, October 30-31, 2001.

We have confirmations from our speakers: Secretary of State Powell,
Secretary of Treasury O'Neill, Secretary of Commerce Evans, EPA
Administrator Whitman and Senator Kennedy (D-MA).  We continue to work with
the White House, hoping for an address by the President, and that appears
quite likely.  If so, there is also a high
probability that we will go to The White House complex  for that address.
Unfortunately, because of space limitations, only NAM Directors and their
spouses will be included in that group.

With the threat of recession on everyone's mind, we will focus much of our
attention on the economy - as well as on security issues and life after
Sept. 11 - during our plenary and regional breakout sessions.  We look
forward to your active participation in these discussions about how to
achieve economic recovery and improve homeland security.

In addition to the security that is automatic with Administration officials
when they
appear before a group, we have secured the assistance of a professional firm
to assure
that our directors and guests feel safe and secure during our meeting.  

We are returning to normalcy within the city as far as air and rail travel
are concerned.  A few delays can be expected as you enter and exit the
security gates.  But I encourage you to feel confident that you will enjoy
your visit to Washington, D.C. and that we will have a great meeting!

I look forward to seeing you soon.

intends to reconvene at 11:00 a.m. to vote on the measure again.",,,Assembly
1858,"Below is a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor 
Davis on 2/9/01.  

For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version:

These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things:

1.  Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of 
Existing Powerplants
2.  Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities
3.  Centralize Authority and/or Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting 
and Construction

The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting 
powerplants; and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full 
capacity.  (ie; the carrot and the stick)

They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators 
to sell their power under contract to the State Dept. of Water.

Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will 
be:

- How much capacity is truly ""idling"" and will be able to be brought back on 
line or increase its output?
- Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create 
flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to 
positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction 
and operation?
- How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and 
how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given 
the other issues in CA?

We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders, but wanted to get 
information to you in a timely manner.

D-22-01  Increased Output/Expedited Siting Mandates 
  
CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power 
generators. 
- limited to less than 50MWs using existing installed capacity b/w 
06/01-10/01/01 

Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal 
powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate.

Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed 
thermal powerplants.

Action by the State Water Resources Control Board  to insure wastewater 
issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating.

Requirements for the State Dept. of Water Resources to purchase power from 
powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not 
other market for their power.

Expires  12/31/01 unless extended

Analysis:

This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are 
currently not operating or not operating at full capacity.  It does not waive 
air quality requirements (they are addressed in a separate order).  

D-23-01  Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements

ISO Requirements:
- Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO
- Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly
- Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities
- Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide 
those records to Electricity Oversight Board
- Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below 
performance benchmarks est. by the ISO
- Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to 
impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities 
have fallen     below performance benchmarks est. by the ISO

Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and 
Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISO's ability 
to ensure adequate power during peak demand.

Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by 
utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability.

Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its 
authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est. 
benchmarks for availability and performance, and issue fines against those 
plants, after a hearing.

Analysis:

Again, the tone of this order is that the state won't tolerate outages as an 
excuse for not generating.  It is also an attempt to better manage planned 
outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants 
where off-line for maintenance at the same time.

D-24-01  Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures

Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of 
operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities 
that provide power under contract to the Dept. of Water Resources are not 
restricted in their ability to operate.
- Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable 
emissions in excess of the previous limits
- If air districts do not comply, the Board (CARB?) shall impose 
modifications on the permits in lieu of districts

The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions 
reductions from all available sources:
- Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need 
emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the 
Summer Peak Season in 2001
- In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to 
the Dept. of Water Resources, CA will make available where necessary and 
available the required emissions credits at up to a 50 percent reduction,
- In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity, 
emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to 
facilities where necessary and available.
- Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made 
available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the 
new or expanded facility is located.

Expires 12/31/2001 unless extended

Analysis:

This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours 
for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept. 
of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit 
bank available for use by other sources.  There are a lot of details that 
remain to be clarified, including how the state is going to locate emissions 
reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful.  However, it is a step 
in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive 
authority back to the state level.

D-25-01  Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants

Expedites review and approval of post-certification amendments to increase 
output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission.

Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes 
and regulations that normally control post-certifications to the extent that 
they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency.

Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of 
construction within one year of certification, and for the construction phase 
of the project.  Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy 
Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of 
the certification.

Expires 12/31/01 unless extended

Analysis

Again, no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and 
completed in a timely manner.

D-26-01  Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources

Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to 7 days for 
required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all 
powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission (under 50MWs) and 
that are proposed to be on line by summer 2001.

 Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways:
- Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants 
for construction and operation by July 31, 2001.
-Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO 
and can be online by July 2001 may also apply to be permitted by the Energy 
Commission under the emergency siting process.
-Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within 
four months, shall apply to any proposed simple-cycle thermal powerplant that 
can be brought on line by August 31, 2002  and that have an application for 
certification complete by Dec. 31. 2001.
-Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants, emission 
offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for 
certification
-The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites 
in the state and prepare a report by 02/21/01  identifying those areas of the 
state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to 
augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of 2003.

IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within 7 days of receipt 
of completed application.

Expires 12/31/01 unless extended.

Cogeneration Company) are located in California.  Three of the facilities 
(Panther Creek Partners, Inter-Power Ahlcon LP (Colver) and Gilberton Power 
Company) are located in Pennsylvania.  ENA has contracted RTP Environmental 
Associates to conduct the due diligence (fatal flaw) and site visits.  The 
site visits will be conducted 9/5/00 - 9/8/00 for the California facilities 
and 9/12/00 - 9/15/00 for the Pennsylvania facilities.  Don Stevens will be 
conducting the environmental review of RTP's report.  The commercial 
objective is to restructure the PPA.

EH&S Compliance Requirements Summary - Susan Worthen is developing the 
Summary with the intent  to provide Enron commercial groups with a brief 
understanding of EH&S requirements necessary in operating a facility.  The 
Summary will be routed to other EH&S individuals within Enron for their input 
before distribution or use in meetings.

Eletrobolt PP (Brazil) - Joe Kolb participated in a conference call regarding 
this project ; another power plant situated immediately adjacent to RioGen 
PP, with some compression on the natural gas pipeline lateral being 
constructed for RioGen.  RioGen and Eletrobolt have different ownership 
mixes.  Environmental impact assessment and air emission modeling are 
critical path issues.

CEP Survey - Susan Worthen and Lauren Golblatt provided information to Gwynn 
Hanmer Gorush (community affairs) for a survey by the Council on Economic 
Priorities.

Enron Methanol Plant Economic Study - Marc Phillips submitted information to 
the Business Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) regarding the economic impact of 
the proposed NOx RACT rules on the methanol plant reformer and engines. The 
total cost to install controls and electrify the engines at the methanol 
plant is estimated at $18.2 million.

Participation on ANSI Standard Setting Committee - Russell Tucker has been 
accepted as an Observer member on the Accredited Standards Committee for the 
Z10 Occupational Health and Safety Systems proposed ANSI standard. The 
completion of this ANSI standard will have an impact on all Enron companies 
in the US and territories, followed thereafter with impact to Enron 
international interest involved in ISO certifications. Russell Tucker will 
also serve on the API Z10 task force.

Ergonomics Software Program - Russ Tucker is coordinating an Enron pilot 
computer based training program on ergonomics.  the purpose is to grandfather 
Enron prior to passage of prescriptive OSHA regulations requiring such a 
training program for any employee who uses a computer for 50% of their work 
effort. However, everyone must not necessarily have used the software 
training program before the regulations pass. There are costs saving in 
becoming grandfathered, because of the flexibility of using the computer 
based training program in lieu of the prescriptive OSHA programs.

Caledonia Power Plant - The Mississippi Environmental Enforcement Division 
conducted an unannounced environmental inspection at the EES OEC power 
plant.  No significant issues were identified in the inspection.

EES Origination - Mike Terraso facilitated an introduction of EES Harold 
Buchanan and Michael Mann to General Motors Vice President of Environmental 
and Energy to initiate a energy outsourcing proposal.

Pipeline Safety Legislation- Jeff Keeler continues to lead the Enron effort 
in monitoring and influencing the Senate and House versions of potential 
pipeline safety legislation.  He is working closely with Stan Horton and 
David Johnson in GPG. The Senate version passed late on Thursday September 
7th.

     I've been thinking of you quite a bit over the past few months as the 
     Enron woes have unfolded and finally decided to drop you a line.  I 
     hope you're keeping your legendary sense of perspective.  One of the 
     things I have admired about you is that you never lose sight of the 
     fact that people make an organization successful, a lesson many of 
     your Enron peers apparently have yet to learn.  Maybe it comes from 
     having priorities other than making money ot being powerful, but my 
     conversations with friends demonstrates that they still appreciate 
     your loyalty to your staff.
     
     Philadelphia agrees very well with Michael and me.  We're getting 
     ensconced in our house and adjusting to life in the 'burbs.  
     Fortunately, we're in Bryn Mawr, where we have a college town, rather 
     than suburban, environment.  In fact, we are within three miles of 
     four four-year colleges!  I've seen Mike Terrasso at some of the EHS 
     meetings - what a thoughtful, gentle man.  
     
     Although I miss some of the excitement and intellectual stimulation of 
     working at Enron, I don't miss Houston (except for the people).  
     However, I'm energized by the notion of incorporating EHS excellence 
     into a coherent management system that focuses on improving the bottom 
     line, and I'm enjoying the challenge of managing a large staff again.  
     Given all of the recent consolidation in the refining industry, I'm 
     thankful for Sunoco's strong perfromance over the past couple of years 
     and hope that we can remain independent for a few more years.

The rebound begins

Greenspan's aggressive rate cutting will fuel a market comeback that should
boost stock prices 20 percent or more over the next 12 months.

By Michael Sivy

For nine months, the economy has been slowing. And most growth stocks have
been dragged down by a brutal decline in tech shares. Through it all,
investors complained that the Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates
too high. Well, there's nothing left to complain about. Fed chairman Alan
Greenspan's surprise half-point cut on Wednesday brings interest rates down
to where they should be. And make no mistake about it -- the economy will
begin picking up speed, and the stock market will be substantially higher a
year from now.

Greenspan has been widely criticized for keeping rates high for so long. He
began raising them in early 1999 and continued to keep rates up through the
end of last year. High rates made sense in the first half of 2000, when the
GDP was growing at an annual rate around 5 percent, fast enough to rekindle
inflation. But it was a mistake for Greenspan to continue keeping money
tight after growth slackened to 2.2 percent in the third quarter. Moreover,
even once he began cutting rates in January, he brought them down too slowly.

I believe that Greenspan held up rates for so long because he knows how
tough it is to fight inflation. For political reasons, it's often hard to
increase interest rates. So when the Fed has a chance to give inflation an
extra push down simply by keeping rates up a bit too long, that's the
politically savvy choice. Greenspan even has a term for that ploy -- he
calls it ""opportunistic disinflation.""

Such a policy was perfectly feasible as long as the economy was expanding
slightly -- and thereby narrowly escaping recession. But capital spending
continued to weaken and mounting stock market losses threatened to undercut
consumer spending. Then when the March employment numbers were announced on
April 6, they showed the first drop in a long time. With employment
weakening -- and unemployment rising -- Greenspan could no longer afford to
keep his foot on the brake. And so, two weeks later he cut rates, laying
the groundwork for a substantial rebound.

I'm not minimizing the risks that still exist. The economy will most likely
be weak for another quarter. And plenty of individual stocks will suffer in
May and June as companies warn of disappointing second-quarter results.
There are also lots of industry-specific problems to worry about. Banks
face rising losses on bad tech loans, telecommuniciations companies could
suffer from overcapacity for at least another 18 months and various tech
firms are still trying to work off excess inventories.

In fact, the current market rally could burn out in a week or two. But I
believe the market has already seen its lows. And if those lows are
re-tested between May and July, I doubt the indexes will go much below
where they've already been.

More important, the prices of big, strong, well-established growth stocks
figure to be substantially higher a year from now. Historically, after the
Fed has cut rates four times in a row, blue chips gain more than 20 percent
over the following year. I think we're looking at those kinds of gains
again. Tech stocks will rally, but so will other glamour growth stocks,
including entertainment shares and top retailers.

I've already mentioned in this column that I jumped the gun by loading up
on tech indexes in January and February, and then running up 15 percent to
20 percent losses in March as the sector suffered its final drop. Well,
after today I'm almost even, so I plan on buying myself a really good
brandy after dinner this evening. And whatever the ups and downs of the
next few months, I expect to be feeling even better come next April.

Higher Flyer

Top techs such as Nokia may not look cheap by traditional valuation
measures. But they may still be good buys.

By Michael Sivy

Value is a relative term. Every once in a while, you get a chance to buy
shares in a company with annual earnings growth of more than 20 percent at
a price/earnings ratio of 16 or less. But that doesn't happen very often.
Most of the time, conservative investors are lucky to find 14 percent
growth at a 16 P/E. Slightly more aggressive investors might be happy with
18 percent growers at P/Es in the low 20s. The most successful growth
stocks, however, may never fall all the way down to those cheap valuations.
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy them.

In fact, there are good reasons to devote at least a part of your portfolio
to those kinds of high flyers. For one thing, those companies are typically
among the world's most successful. In addition, they receive ongoing
support and sponsorship from Wall Street analysts. As long as they continue
to meet expectations, they will hold up fairly well in temporary market
downturns. And they will be among the first stocks to bounce back.

A perfect case in point looks to be Nokia [NOK]. The Finnish giant is the
most successful firm in one of the world's most rapidly growing industries.
And since 1997, Nokia's share of the global wireless-phone handset market
has risen from less than 20 percent to 35 percent, helping the company
nearly double earnings per share since 1998.

Of course, no company can increase its market share indefinitely, but there
are several factors that should help sustain Nokia's superior profit
growth. Since most everyone who would use a cell phone already has one, the
bulk of the sales of cell phones using existing technology is replacement
business. And when existing users switch phones, they tend to maintain
brand loyalty -- if they change providers at all, they migrate toward the
strongest one (say from Ericsson to Nokia, but not the other way around).
As a result, Nokia could gain another couple of market share points in
current-technology handsets.

Even more important, the company is capable of attaining a market share
topping 40 percent in the next generation of handsets -- both those that
use more sophisticated technology for voice transmission and those that
will provide paging, instant messaging, and Internet access. Overall, the
handset market is projected to grow at an annual compound rate of just
under 23 percent over the next four years. And with market share gains,
Nokia's sales should do even better.

In the past few quarters, the over-capacity problems that have plagued the
telecom industry have been hurting handset makers as well as service
providers. Not only has growth slowed -- total sales of cell phones were up
only 12 percent in the first quarter -- but the introduction of new
technology is being delayed. As a result, Nokia's earnings, up just 15
percent in the first quarter, will likely fall short of a 20 percent gain
for the year as a whole.

Once the current slump passes, however, Nokia's growth should recover to
nearly 25 percent a year. And so, despite a P/E of 40 based on estimated
earnings for the current year, the stock seems quite attractive. At $33,
Nokia is trading at just over half the level it was a year ago. And the
share price, which dipped as low as $21 a month ago, now appears to be in
an upswing. Even if the next couple of quarters show subpar results, Nokia
figures to be back among the market's brightest stars within 12 months.

1930,"Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years.  Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning.

Contracts Structure

There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.


PassWord Application (PA)

The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  

The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline. 

We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.


Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)

The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.


General Terms and Conditions (GTC)

To be sent when the Buyer is known.
When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. 

Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.

Mark Taylor forwarded me your request, I thought it may be helpful to introduce myself and Dave Forster, Dave is the Vice President in charge of the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  As Mark probably already informed you we are taking the opportunity to update the PA and ETA.  Under the timescale we do plan to have these with you today.  

Should Citigroup be the winning bidder, we are currently planning to use the website name ""citigroupenergy.com, 'ssmbenergy.com' or 'ssbenergy.com'.  If you intend to give us one of your own doamine names please let us know. 

If you have any questions  on the timetable, please do not hesitate to contact Dave or myself, or on the form of the agreements Mark Taylor.

1946,"The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.  

Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.

 If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish.

Imbedded in these allocations are several functions for which EIM receives 100% dedicated resources (legal, HR, PR, etc.).  Every 100% dedicated resource should be presented in its own RC -- in that way it becomes ""controllable"" and measurable.  Today it is buried in an indirect allocation.  This approach will isolate the truly indirect allocations and allow us to better manage the amount and appropriateness of these expenses.  We plan to push this topic with respect to all allocations which hit EIM from Enron Americas, Enron Networks, or Enron Corp.  Kent Castleman (EIM CAO) is going to discuss this approach with Wes.

Introduction

Enron Metals Limited  (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp. =
 EML is one of Enron's two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service=
s Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron's only remaining b=
rokerage business.  Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to i=
ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L=
ME (metals exchange) of which it is a member.  As a result of this regulato=
ry oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron's other b=
usinesses:
1)=09EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato=
ry rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus=
iness. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d=
isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers.

2)=09By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumst=
ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients.  EML's p=
olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML's cond=
uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship=
 to exist.  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th=
e FSA and the LME.

3)=09Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an=
d to protect against systemic risk, EML's position as a provider of liquidi=
ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la=
ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a co=
nsequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain =
prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi=
tion and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA =
regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc=
e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem=
ent. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be =
used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded =
as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ=
irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c=
ease carrying on business.

4)=09EML's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o=
versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for=
 a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines=
 and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members=
 under the FSA's rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r=
elating to directors' duties.

Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation

In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem=
onstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial streng=
th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t=
he rest of Enron.  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation =
we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below.

Issues Surrounding Liquidity

As we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation probl=
ems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased th=
e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML.  This was a precautio=
n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML.  Clearly the =
goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing =
of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t=
he non-EML related problems of Enron.  This of course needed to be accompli=
shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp=
any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was=
 concerned =20

The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains=
 and distributes its cash.  In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML,=
 it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap=
ital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its=
 day to day liquidity.=20
=20
In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purp=
oses.  First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (=
LCH).  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater=
al to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc=
ement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and =
the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions.  Second, it=
 must be able to post margin to its clients.  A failure to make a contractu=
al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre=
d to the FSA.  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-=
money clients in the event that they wish to close their account.  While th=
ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr=
ofits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest=
ions.

Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari=
os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However ce=
rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to =
fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from=
 the rest of Enron has become a concern.  EML has or is in the process of l=
osing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC's, which were primarily used in lieu of c=
ash at the LCH.  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC'=
s.  Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be=
 transferred.  Those transfers have reduced EML's cash balance.  Was the re=
maining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be =
withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid=
ity impact.

The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo=
r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality.  Therefore we have =
agreed to start to do the following
a.=09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid=
ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t=
he rest of the enterprise
b.=09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control=
 as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel
c.=09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints=
 of continuing to do business on a normal basis
d.=09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basis
e.=09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a=
s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity
f.=09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi=
onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou=
r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis

Operational Risk =20

In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account=
s and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash =
needs.  EML's board have been resistant to this practice for several very p=
ractical reasons.  First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca=
ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis.  I=
f EML relied on Enron Corp.'s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, =
it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an acco=
unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either=
 capital or liquidity events as EML's clearing account at Citibank would be=
 substantially overdrawn.  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi=
ght create a cascade for Enron, EML's board is reluctant to put that much f=
aith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards.

Capital

As noted above, EML is subject to the FSA's regulatory capital rules and mu=
st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis.  The FSA requires th=
at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum finan=
cial resources requirement.  For a variety of reasons, there were occasions=
 when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these v=
iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo=
rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain=
s financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer =
not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the=
 FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari=
se from Enron's perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those =
violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga=
tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh=
t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM=
L's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily =
basis, EML's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev=
el of 130%.  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces=
s capital adequacy go hand in hand. =20

Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing

The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce=
narios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML

1)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte=
rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral=
 rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
2)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac=
count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
3)=09Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME =
brokers
4)=09Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i=
nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca=
sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly=20
5)=09Credit exposures leading to credit losses

Recommendations

The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following=
 changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov=
erall operational liquidity

1)=09To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the  $125 mm s=
ubordinated facility
2)=09To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm)
3)=09To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturi=
ty by six months to July 2002
4)=09To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi=
ts and other assets held by EML
5)=09To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch=
 to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol=
d for calling margin
6)=09To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other th=
an a select group of key relationship clients=20
7)=09To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c=
ompanies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory finance

Enron Bonds Subject To Market Jitters, Not Buyout Talk
By Michael C. Barr
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/05/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Reports over the weekend that embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) might be the object of a takeover bid failed to move the company's bonds Monday. 
On Sunday, the Independent in London reported that Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. (RD) planned to mount an $11 billion offering for the company. And Barron's stated that there was speculation that Enron might attract takeover interest from either Royal Dutch or Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA).
Enron's bonds are quoted in dollar prices and not in terms of a spread in relation to Treasury bond issues. 
A $74 bid and a $77 offer was quoted as the market for Enron's 7-7/8% bonds of 2003 Monday morning, similar to Friday's levels. 
""The company's bonds were quoted in the low- to mid-70s on Friday and the rumors have not shown up in that pricing,"" said Wayne Schmidt, portfolio manager, Advantus Capital Management, St. Paul, Minn. 
""Market perception and not takeover rumors impact the pricing of the bonds,"" said Eric Bergson, portfolio manager, Northern Trust Global Investments, Chicago. 
Even an Enron bond with a very short time to maturity is not trading at par, traders said. 
The 6.45% coupon bond due on November 15, 2001, less than two weeks away, was bid at a dollar price of 99. 
""Some investors don't want to own anything with a downside risk,"" said Harold Rivkin, principal, H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J. The bonds could lose a lot of value in that time frame, with little upside potential gain, he added. 
There is ""very little liquidity in the company's bonds,"" said Rivkin. Enron's bonds will follow the company's stock movements, he added. Enron closed Monday at $11.03, down $0.27 from Friday's close of $11.30. 
Enron officials weren't immediately available to comment. 
Crisis Of Investor Confidence 

The Houston-based energy services company has faced a crisis of investor confidence since it reported a $618 million third quarter loss and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last month. 
And last Wednesday, the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commission had elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into Enron's financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
The ratings agencies have reacted to the company's liquidity problems brought about by the loss in investor confidence. Fitch downgraded Enron's senior unsecured debt Monday to triple-B-minus, from triple-B-plus. It's now just a notch away from junk bond status. 
Last week, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered the credit rating to triple-B, while Moody's Investors Service lowered the rating to Baa2. 
Shell May Have Interest, But 

Royal Dutch Shell may have an interest in Enron, say analysts. 
""Shell has a very sophisticated trading operations and has been looking to expand in North America and Latin America,"" said Tina Vital, equity analyst, Standard & Poor's. 
Enron is known for its trading prowess. 
And Enron could also be attractive if it could be bought cheaply, since ""Shell has a history of not overpaying for its acquisitions,"" Vital said. 
But, ""no one is going to buy the company unless it squares up its equity issues,"" she added. 
The company is not perceived by the markets as having been forthcoming in its financial reporting, analysts said.

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.
3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.
4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

?=09Senator Keeley Spearheads a New ""Plan B""
?=09State to Offer Little Aid in PG&E Bankruptcy

Keeley's Collective ""Plan B""
Sources report that additional details for the Plan B have just been ironed=
 out on the Assembly side.  The Assembly is working to announce a plan ""as =
soon as possible""; this announcement could come this afternoon.  If it is n=
ot this afternoon, it will be later this week.   Sources Report the Republi=
cans were working with Keeley, but then felt shut out of the process, so th=
ey developed a plan of their own (a lightly publicized point last week).  H=
owever, sources believe that the Plan B is very likely to have enough Repub=
lican support to pass the Assembly.  The Senate will likely be a much tough=
er fight, but opposition to the plan remains pessimistic that they will be =
able to stop it.  The Senate appears likely to broaden the base of people w=
ho would have to pay the dedicated rate component, which will be unpopular.=
  Borrowing from elements of the Joe Nation and Florez ""Plan B's,"" Keeley's=
 new plan is said to:
?=09Set up a dedicated rate component for SoCal to deal with part of their =
undercollect.  This dedicated rate component would apply more to ""high-end =
customers.""  Where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who wo=
uld not is still subject to negotiation.  The size of the dedicated rate co=
mponent is also subject to negotiation.  SoCal has suggested $3M for 10 to =
12 years.  Note, sources report that at this time, a dedicated rate compone=
nt for SoCal to pay for power going forward is NOT included in the Plan B t=
hat will be announced.  The Assembly is not certain whether this additional=
 dedicated rate component will be needed.  If the bond issuance is enough t=
o cover the cost of power purchases, no dedicated rate component for forwar=
d purchases will be needed.  By 2003 and 2004, enough additional generation=
 should be online that power prices should be low.  Therefore, the key ques=
tion becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002?  If the cost of power =
is high, rates may have to be increased at that time for SoCal to continue =
operating.
?=09The state would make a secured loan (secured against the transmission a=
ssets) to SoCal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect.  This loan w=
ould be paid back by SoCal granting the government a lower rate of return o=
n the transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years.  This provides an=
 incentive for SoCal to sell its transmission system to the state, since it=
 would not be making as much money from the system.  Were this to happen, t=
he value would be credited toward the loan.
?=09In return, the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the=
 filed rate doctrine case.  Also, SoCal would reduce the price of native po=
wer generation.  Finally, business customers (including those that would ha=
ve to pay the dedicated rate component) would have the right to apply for d=
irect access to power.
If this plan is passed, (better than 50/50 chance -as reported earlier) the=
 constitutional challenge from Michael Sturmwasser is still likely to go fo=
rward.  This is because Sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that=
 the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay SoCal's undercollec=
t.  Sources believe it is likely that SoCal will eventually sell its transm=
ission assets to the state if this plan is passed.  Therefore these assets =
would become municipal, making the reduction in the PUC's authority constit=

Legislature Leaves PG&E to Throws of Bankruptcy
Today, there have been discussions concerning PG&E regarding ""Plan B"" and t=

?	Sources report that SoCal Chairman, John Bryson, and Governor Davis were roommates together at Stanford in the early 60's.  This longstanding relationship may provide some explanation for SoCal's willingness to negotiate with the governor and the governor's determination to reach a solution with SoCal.

?	Voluntary bankruptcy reportedly is ""not an option"" for SoCal.  However, the possibility remains that SoCal's creditors will take them into involuntary bankruptcy.  If the state's purchase of the transmission assets is delayed, it appears that the possibility of this occurring will increase.

?	However, the agreement by the state to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is actually a Memorandum of Understanding. The agreement reportedly was rushed for ""political purposes,"" but the details still remain to be decided.  It is possible, the 60-day deadline stated in the memorandum may have to be extended.

1996,"We have an agreement in principle for a resolution of our investment entanglement at Canfibre Riverside and Canfibre Lackawanna:

	There will be no draw on the $4.5 million Enron obligation to fund Lackawanna based upon acceptance tests.
	Any such funding would have benefited only the senior lenders at this facility (of which we are not one).

	There will be complete release of Enron and subsidiaries for any claims, including underwriters' liability relating
	to Enron's promotion and sale of the Lackawanna bonds.  This release will cover any current or past contracts
	or agreements at any time related to our investment and ownership.  It does not include potential claims on the
	power contract at Riverside that was terminated when that company went into bankruptcy.  This contract could
	not be included since all the unsecured creditors at Riverside are stakeholders.
	
	Enron will receive $250K in cash.

In return:

	Enron will assign the Canfibre loans and the stock of the Canfibre group to the senior bondholders.

Enron's investment in the loans and stock included in this deal were written-off totally last year.  We were facing an additional potential write-off of $4.5 million this year relating to the Lackawanna additional funding.  In addition to the $4.8 million hard-dollar recovery, this transaction avoids a very real, substantial potential liability due to Enron's heavy involvement (and specific underwriting of Lackawanna) in the two Canfibre deals in which well in excess of $200 million investment (over $150 million of which came from third parties) was lost in two catastrophic financial disasters.  Richard Sanders has confirmed that getting rid of any claim on underwriters' liability has significant value in this situation.  We avoid continuing to incur substantial legal and professional expenses over a prolonged period.  We terminate significant commercial and legal time and effort that is much more productively reassigned elsewhere.

If the deal is closed, I view this resolution as a grandslam home run in the bottom of the ninth.  Through a barrage of analyses and negotiation, John Enerson managed to create some leverage where none existed that eventually forced the Canfibre bondholders into finally recognising that we were more than ready to fight them aggressively on every issue by all means available and bring them to the table.  In the end we got virtually everything we could possibly have obtained under any reasonable scenario.  John has handled this deal with creativity and persistence and deserves credit for orchestrating a very sensitive situation.  Wayne Mays from Technical Services provided key engineering support.

The documentation and closing of this transaction is scheduled to occur early next week.  Normally I would wait for closing to report success.  Since this deal was put together very rapidly, however, I wanted time to clarify any questions that might arise prior to final execution.  Of course, given that the status is agreement in principle, there is always the chance (we believe it is highly unlikely) that the deal could fall apart.

Enron's Lay Turns Down Severance Pay
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/14/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. said its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has decided to forgo a severance payment of $60.6 million that could be triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of Enron. Mr. Lay's decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice. 
Early in the day, an Enron filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission laid out Mr. Lay's severance package. By midday, Enron indicated that Mr. Lay would keep only one-third of the payout, which he would take in stock in the combined company, and that he intended to donate one-third to a foundation to help displaced Enron employees. The remaining third would cover income-tax liabilities.
But by the end of the day, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said that Mr. Lay, following a meeting of Enron energy traders, had decided against taking any of the severance pay. Though Mr. Lay didn't attend the traders' meeting, senior managers told him that ""opinions were expressed that he shouldn't receive the payment,"" Mr. Palmer said. ""He decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment."" The opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of Enron's profits. Questions for Mr. Lay were directed to Mr. Palmer, who said he had spoken with Mr. Lay and other company officials during the day. 
The initial disclosure about Mr. Lay's hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell Enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago. Last Friday, Mr. Lay even said that Enron had other options to the Dynegy purchase, which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent, though he declined to elaborate. ""Things weren't desperate . . . we had alternatives,"" Mr. Lay said. The 59-year-old Mr. Lay won't have an executive position at the combined company, though he might be a director. 
For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial. Last year, Mr. Lay was paid $8.3 million in salary and bonus and more than $10 million in stock awards and other compensation. 
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company's extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers. Those dealings are under investigation by the SEC. Last Friday, Enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller Houston-based Dynegy for stock, currently valued at about $10.7 billion. The merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies. 
Separately, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns about three million Enron and 500,000 Dynegy shares, said it would oppose the appointment of any current Enron board member to the board of a combined company. Michael Flaherman, chair of CalPERS investment committee said that it appeared that Enron's board ""failed in its responsibility"" to monitor the activities of Enron executives. 
Mr. Palmer, the Enron spokesman, said Mr. Lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward. In February 2000, when Enron stock was trading between $60 and $70 a share and Mr. Lay was being widely lauded for his performance, he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously. Last August, when Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling quit unexpectedly, Mr. Lay assumed Mr. Skilling's duties and his contract term was extended by two years to Dec. 31, 2005. 
Under the terms of his contract, Mr. Lay is entitled to payment of $20.2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract, in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control. Thus, Mr. Lay is entitled to three full years of payments, or $60.6 million. 
Mr. Lay, who took charge of the then-Houston Natural Gas Co. in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company, wasn't the only member of his family to benefit from Enron's heady rise to a global energy giant. SEC filings show that in recent years a sister of Mr. Lay, Sharon Lay, and a son, Mark Lay, received millions of dollars in salary, commissions and bonuses related to Ms. Lay's travel agency and a paper-products company connected to the younger Mr. Lay. 
Mr. Palmer said it is a ""cheap shot"" to criticize the Lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements. ""The contracts were bid out and fairly awarded,"" Mr. Palmer said. Ms. Lay said her travel agency, of which she is president and half-owner, had won its Enron business through competitive bidding and by providing ""the very best service possible."" Mark Lay couldn't be reached for comment. 
Coming on top of disclosures of Enron's dealings with partnerships run by its own executives, the relationships between Lay family members and the company again raise questions about Enron's willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests. Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and possibly other Enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships. 
Mark Lay's dealings with Enron date back to 1994, according to the available SEC filings. In May 1997, Mark Lay and ""certain other individuals"" who together had been officers, directors or shareholders of a company called Paper & Print Management Corp., or PPMC, entered into employment agreements with an Enron unit, Enron Capital & Trade Resources, according to Enron's 1998 proxy statement. The individuals helped set up ""a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products,"" according to the SEC filing. Mr. Palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of Enron's profitable paper and pulp-trading business. 
As part of the deal, Enron agreed to reimburse PPMC $1 million for certain expenses. Mark Lay and his colleagues also agreed to ""convey"" to Enron ""certain intangible property rights"" from PPMC. 
Mark Lay also got a three-year employment contract from Enron as a vice president of Enron Capital & Trade. He got a signing bonus of $100,000, a minimum monthly salary of $12,500, a minimum annual bonus of $100,000 for 1997-1999 and an option to purchase 20,000 Enron shares. Mark Lay is no longer with Enron and is now attending a seminary, said Mr. Palmer. 
Since 1985, Sharon Lay's firm, Lay/Wittenberg Travel Agency in the Park Inc., has provided travel arrangements for employees of Enron and its predecessor company. For this work the agency received $6.8 million from 1996 through 2000. In an interview yesterday, Ms. Lay said Enron accounted for more than half of her firm's revenue in some years. She said her brother's position was ""more a problem"" than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn't worked hard enough to get Enron's business.

Inside Track
Enron CEO Cut Stakes in Firms Where He Sits in Director's Seat
By Cassell Bryan-Low
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/14/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Kenneth L. Lay, Enron Corp.'s embattled chairman and chief executive, in recent weeks has cashed in nearly $2 million of shares in companies at which he sits on the board. 
Mr. Lay, 59 years, sold $1.2 million of shares, or more than a quarter of his holdings, of Compaq Computer Corp., where he has been a director for 14 years. In his first sale of the Houston-based company's shares since 1999, he disposed of 124,596 shares Oct. 29 for $9.25 each, leaving him with a 340,724 share stake. Apart from two directors who resigned, he is the only Compaq insider to have sold shares this year.
The sale comes as the computer company awaits completion of its planned merger with Hewlett-Packard Co. -- a deal the board has repeatedly said it supports. In a Nov. 7 news release, the board, including Mr. Lay, said it ""reaffirmed its strong support for the proposed merger."" A day earlier, H-P's founding Hewlett family, which controls 5% of H-P stock, said it intended to oppose the merger, throwing the deal's future into uncertainty. Compaq shares traded at $8.80, up $1.14, as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. 
The sale, Mr. Lay said, wasn't related to his views on the merger. ""It's no negative [reflection] on Compaq,"" he said. Mr. Lay, who also sold shares of drug maker Eli Lilly & Co., where he has been a director since 1993, said of both sales, ""I needed to have a little more liquidity."" 
On Oct. 31, he sold 10,000 shares of Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, representing roughly a 16% reduction of his holdings, at prices of $77.55 and $77.56 a share, or $775,550 total. That figure is $34,250 above what he paid for the same number of shares Feb. 20 at $74.13 each. After the sale, Mr. Lay owned 54,528 Eli Lilly shares. 
Eli Lilly shares traded at $78.97, up 75 cents, on the NYSE yesterday. Eli Lilly had no comment on the sales, and Compaq spokesman Arch Currid said, ""We don't comment on the personal financial transactions of board members."" 
Mr. Lay also noted that much of his net worth is tied up in Enron, shares of which tumbled by as much as 80% during the past several weeks alone. Enron shocked investors Oct. 16 when it announced a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Houston energy company has since announced huge write-offs of assets, reductions of shareholder equity, major downward restatements of past earnings reports; and it has disclosed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships. Shares have recovered some ground since Friday's announcement by Dynegy Inc., a rival Houston independent power producer, of plans to acquire Enron. Shares of Enron traded at $9.98, up 74 cents, or 8%, on the Big Board as of 4 p.m. 
As previously reported, Mr. Lay sold $25.7 million of his Enron shares this year, as the stock fell from about $78 to under $44, and his remaining stake is valued at about $28 million. For 2000, he earned a salary of $1.3 million, a bonus of $7 million, plus $7.5 million in Enron restricted stock and other benefits, including use of a personal plane, according to Enron's proxy statement. 
Mr. Lay, who was Enron's CEO from 1985 until February of this year, resumed the post after his successor, Jeffrey Skilling, stepped down in August after only six months on the job. At that time, Mr. Lay agreed to stay on through 2005, but his employment agreement provides for a lump-sum payment under a change of control, such as the proposed merger with Dynegy, according to a regulatory document filed yesterday. The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Mr. Lay would be entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment within 60 days of the merger. In addition, Mr. Lay is entitled to an amount for any related tax penalties if the payment was deemed to constitute an ""excess parachute payment,"" the filing said. 
Mr. Lay also serves on the board of EOTT Energy Corp. -- the general partner of EOTT Energy Partners LP -- and NewPower Holdings Co. 
Mr. Lay also recently sold his stake in i2 Technologies Inc., according to his spokesman, following Mr. Lay's resignation from the board of that company Oct. 25 after serving for a year. As of March 2001, he owned 13,000 shares of the Dallas business-software company, a stake that would have been valued at about $64,000 at the time he resigned.

Brett Wiggs is requesting approval for $300,000 in net spend related to what appears to be change orders and a new storage plan for the MHI turbines.  The DASH indicates that this request is made in the name of ""Enron Americas"".

Is this something that you have discussed with Brett?  In your view, would this be an Enron Americas matter or an EGS matter?   Who presently owns P/L responsibility for the turbines?  At present, EGS is now listed as the ""Controlling Party"" on the Turbine Position Report.

In any case, I'm fairly certain that a full DASH would not be needed here--an I-DASH would be sufficient and I can work with Brett on that.

2007,"The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

""There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore,"" Holmgren said.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=78977.7&random=3696&key=1116&""><B>James Stewart</B></A>, RB DET - Hunter <FONT SIZE=1>

George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.<BR>

Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.<BR>
</FONT><BR>

Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. <BR>

Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>. He may start against the Bengals this week. ""I expect to see more time but I'm still not 100 percent,"" Allen said. ""My hand is going to bother me but I need to be out there on the field to help this team.""<BR>

Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""It's a coincidence,"" Barlow said. ""It was my turn in the rotation to be in there."" The two backs will continue to split carries. <BR>

Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs.<BR>

The Lions held Carter to 30 yards on three catches. Still, the veteran receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any week of the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

	I just wanted to let you know that we haven't forgotten about you.  Kim Alexander who has really been the authority on the pricing information was involved in an auto accident this previous Sunday.  He'll be returning to work next Wednesday and would be able to complete this much faster than anyone else trying to pick it up.

I'll keep you informed next week as to how it goes.

Thanks for your patience,

2023,"With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced 
to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

2065,"I hope that the following clears up some of the  confusion regarding the 
above-captioned process.

Factor loadings are an input to Value-at-Risk (VAR).  Generally, you can 
consider them the determinants of relationships between curves,and points on 
curves based on trader inputs.   These pertain to all curves not just North 
American Natural Gas.  There is a specific program which calculates these 
relationships which requires a considerable amount of processing time (3 
hours per run) as well as another few man-days to evaluate the results.  

There is no ""ideal"" or recommended period in which these must be updated.  
More frequent is ""better"".  Given the amount of time it takes to refresh, it 
was ""agreed"" a long time ago amongst  RAC, Research, IT and Operations that 
it would be done every 2 weeks.  No commercial input was received.  The roles 
were to be simple as they are with most roles in and around VAR and other 
risk management controls: 

 Research specifies the math
 IT codes the program
 Operations runs the program
 RAC evaluates the results 

The process has been run every two weeks on the second Thursday of every 
month since February (as it had been prior) and RAC has rejected the results 
because the results did not reflect the underlying math because of the 
complexity of the math and the continuing addition of new products and 
curves.  This  created the need to recode the application from scratch.   RAC 
continued to agitate to get this done, particularly knowing that the pressure 
on the efficacy of VAR would be questioned as we went into the volatile 
period of 2000 ( e-mails from Rudi Zipter available upon request).  The new 
code was implemented last Thursday and the results were accepted resulting in 
an approximate 10% difference in VAR.

",Rudi Zipter,,"North 
American Natural Gas RAC Research Operations VAR"
2066,"I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list 
of agreed apon tasks.

1.  The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we 
have huge business risk if it blows up. 

 -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to 
maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.  
        (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds 
like it should be a high priority)

2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to 
long hours on the part of our back office staff.  

 -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to 
address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are 
expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add 
hardware and reduce the time problems.

3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately 
combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real 
time risk.
TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the 
traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by 
the               traders to meet their needs. 

 -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in 
consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to 
come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.

4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is 
leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made 
progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the 
next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.

5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin 
Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements 
deals and volume management deals in the east.

6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).

7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their 
books through an interface with Houston.  

 -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its 
worthwile to put servers in Portland.    

 -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering 
all his needs.","Sally Beth Phillip Allen Steve Natt   Kevin

First off, I have a friend who is setting up a plant in Corcoran,
Northern Calif., to manufacture a welded reinforcement grid building
building structural systems.  They will need 480V/1200 amp. service.  I
suggested that they would be better off making an electricity provision
agreement with you rather than PG&E.

His name is Hans Bauman.  He can be reached at 949-640 2880.  Please
have your people contact him ASAP as he plans to open for business in
November.

Next, the Aspen Accord conference in Sweden went extraordinarily well
... especially with the California issues in such abound.  Commissioner
Wood was there along with the mayors etc. of the cities.  I know that
there is a business opportunity that can be developed and would be
pleased, when the timing is right to discuss this with you.  After all
Ken, your California experience should show that improvement in your
position in the marketplace could be better.

Why not, on your next trip to Aspen, give me a call and drop by Orange
County airport and I'll ride up with you.  We can talk about what I see
as lost opportunities and how to capture them.

My new life is going amazingly well.  I'm working in an advisory
capacity in California, Chicago and Sweden ... and taking time to 'smell
the roses'.  Hope you are doing the same.

2095,"Dear Friends, Family and Wedding Party,
I am attaching a tentative itinerary for the wedding
weekend. Some of the times for transportation and hair
appointments may change as we finalize the schedules,
but for the most part, this should help you plan your
weekend.
We do not have a golf outing planned but I am assured
the Four Seasons and Hilton can help arrange golf
groups for wedding guests.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any
questions!
All our love,

2099,"Dear Ken,

I am conducting a review of Enron for TCW's equity portfolios.  You may 
recall that we have spoken several times when you visited TCW for the Board 
of Directors meetings.  Previously I worked in TCW's Latin America investment 
department and have followed Enron's investments in Latin America.  I am now 
working as an analyst for TCW's equity research department.   With the 
encouragement of Robert Day and Leigh Crawford, whom you met with recently in 
Phoenix, I am considering making a recommendation for the purchase of Enron 
stock.

I am writing to you to solicit your help in setting up a visit to Enron for 
Leigh Crawford and myself.  We are interested in meeting with you, Clifford 
Baxter, Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow, Mark Koenig, Richard Buy and any 
other individuals you believe would be helpful in our understanding your 
business.  We would also welcome the opportunity to tour Enron's facilities.

The date of the visit can be chosen for the convenience of you and the other 
managers.  The week of December 18th and the early weeks of January are 
particularly convenient for us.

Thank you very much for your help and I look forward to learning more about 
Enron.

2101,"Ladies and Gentlemen:


Thank you for the constructive dialogue and feedback you have provided to
the process of developing a charter for a Global Business Council at the
WEF.

As part of the process, we have solicited Council member feedback on the
proposed role, structure, governance, activities and performance of the
Global Business Council.  A large number of members have responded through
interviews, e-mail and faxes with their thoughts and perspectives.

You have clearly communicated to us that in order to be a successful and
high performing group, the Global Business Council needs to:

-    Have a clear and articulate purpose
-    Primarily serve as an advisory body
-    Work in a flexible and informal manner
-    Develop a balanced agenda of globally relevant business issues
-    Provide a forum to review these core issues in depth
-    Have meetings that provide substantive discussion to progress the core
agenda.

We have incorporated this thinking into a strawman charter for your review
and feedback.  We will include your comments on this strawman and develop
the next iteration of the draft charter by November 2nd.

As discussed, all responses and comments will be recorded without
attribution to the member source.

Thank you, again, for taking the time to support this exercise.

Sincerely,

Sunny

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current

 I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

2235,"Note:  This research is in sync with what the utilities and industry representatives were saying at the 
Wisconsin Winter Fuels Meeting--that coal prices are up over last year.  LB

Energy Insight News for Friday, October 19, 2001

Utilities should prepare for higher coal prices

Coal prices in the United States were in a trough for so long-take your
pick, 10, 15, 20 years, according to some-that big users-read, power
producers-may have been lulled to sleep.

Well, folks, the wakeup call is soon to be sounded, and, for some major
players, it may sound like a bugle blast in the ear. 

While spot market prices took off as long ago as July 2000, most major
producers were saved from swallowing the huge run-ups on the spot market
because utilities for the most part use long-term contracts to maintain a
hold on their fuel costs. 

However, while the evidence is strictly anecdotal-no buyer wants to tip his
hand to the competition-this much is known: A substantial amount of contract
coal comes off pact in 2002 and 2003. 

And suppliers, who have toiled under the mantra that they would make up for
low prices by increasing productivity-for example, cutting labor costs-are
raring to get what they believe they deserve. 

One big wild card in the upcoming battle for higher prices is how severe the
country's recession will be. Obviously, a long-term downturn dampens energy
usage so utilities and merchant players don't need to replenish their coal
stocks. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

     The FERC Staff has issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement
determining that construction of Guardian Pipeline would have limited
environmental impact and would be an environmentally acceptable
action, based on its proposed and other mitigation measures. The
Draft covers the environmental aspects of constructing and operating
the 149-mile Guardian Pipeline. FERC will take written public
comments on the Draft until August 28th, and will conduct four public
meetings along Guardian's route starting August 14th. It will
address
the comments before issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement on
the project. A final decision on the Guardian Pipeline expected early
next year. The Guardian Pipeline will transport volumes from
interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern Gas
Transmission, and NGPL at the Chicago hub to northern Illinois and

Allegheny buys Enron plants
Allegheny Energy Supply, the unregulated
generation unit of Maryland-based Allegheny
Energy, showed further proof this week of its
aspirations to become a nationwide wholesale
power provider, buying gas-fired plants from
Enron that serve three regions.
Financial terms of the acquisition were not
disclosed, but Allegheny will take possession of
three peaking units developed by Enron North
America: the 546-MW Gleason plant in Gleason,
Tenn.; the 508-MW Wheatland plant in
Wheatland, Ind.; and the 656-MW Lincoln Energy
Center in Manhattan, Ill.
Allegheny has been building and buying
facilities in Pennsylvania but last month gave the
first signal of its broader aspirations, announcing
plans to build a 1,080-MW unit in Arizona.
The three plants being acquired from Enron
all were developed after the 1998 price spikes
in Midwest markets, which highlighted the lack
of flexible generation in the area. All three entered
commercial operation in June 2000.
Don Feenstra, vice president of new
projects at Allegheny Energy Supply, said the
acquisitions fit with the company=01,s broader goal
of doubling the original size of its generation fleet
(about 8,200 MW) in five years. The three Enron
plants total 1,710 MW, swelling Allegheny=01,s portfolio
to more than 12,000 MW. Once the first goal
is reached, Allegheny wants to increase its generation
holdings by another 50% in a second five-year
period.  Feenstra said the Enron plants all can be
converted to combined-cycle for use over ex-tended
periods.",Don Feenstra,,"IPP Enron Allegheny Energy Supply Allegheny

2256,"FYI--Just in case you didn't get a copy of the announcement, below is the article from Inside FERC with the details of the filing at FERC of the previously announced expansion project to be completed and in-service by May, 2003.  Kern River will more than double their capacity into California by adding 885,626 Mcf/d of capacity.  There's also a related article in todays Gas Daily.  gh
  

KERN RIVER SUBMITS $1.26 BILLION PROJECT TO DOUBLE SYSTEM CAPACITY
With its 2002 Expansion certificate in hand, Kern River Gas Transmission Co. last Wednesday filed
with the commission its next capacity ramp-up, which would more than double the capacity of its 922-mile
gas pipeline system from Opal, Wyo., to California. The 2003 Expansion would bring supplies to a region
of the country that ""has experienced well-documented, severe energy shortages,"" Kern River said.
The $1.26 billion project would add 885,626 Mcf/day of capacity to the 845,000 Mcf/day that will be
available once the 2002 Expansion (CP01-31) is complete (IF, 30 July, 6), said the Aug. 1 application. To
accomplish this, the 2003 Expansion would add 634.3 miles of 36-inch-diameter looping in Wyoming,
Utah, Nevada and California and 82.4 miles of 42-inch-diameter looping of a segment owned jointly with
Mojave Pipeline Co.
The application also calls for a net increase of 163,700 horsepower in compression. The upgrade
includes the construction of three new mainline compressor units - the proposed Coyote Creek station in
Uinta County, Wyo., the Salt Lake station in Salt Lake County, Utah, and the Dry Lake station in Clark
County, Nev. Five existing compressor stations also would be upgraded, and the Daggett compressor
station would be reconfigured to compress only Mojave volumes.
Kern River also plans to build a new meter station under its existing certificate to interconnect Kern
River/Mojave facilities with the 30-inch-diameter Adelanto lateral proposed by Southern California Gas
Co. In response to a request from SoCal Gas, the new Kramer Junction meter station is designed to deliver
up to 500,000 Mcf/day by the planned Dec. 31 in-service date. Although SoCal Gas is committed to
provide only 200,000 Mcf/day of firm access rights from this interconnect, additional takeaway capacity
will be available on an interruptible basis, the application said.
Kern River reported that 18 long-term transportation service agreements have been entered into
with shippers. Following an open season, about 85% of the capacity is contracted for 15-year periods and
the remainder for 10-year periods, the application said. Based upon representations made by the expansion
shippers, nearly all of the capacity is projected to be used to serve existing and new power generation
markets in California.
By far the biggest customer for the capacity would be Reliant Energy Services Inc., which signed a 15-
year agreement for 200,000 Dt/day. The next two largest subscribers are Edison Mission Energy (127,500
Dt/day) and Mirant Americas Energy Marketing L.P. (90,000 Dt/day).
The expansion's proposed initial daily incremental rate on a 100%-load-factor basis, excluding fuel, is
70?/Dt for 10-year firm service and 56.8?/Dt for 15-year firm service. In addition, the 2003 Expansion
shippers would be responsible for paying a fuel in-kind reimbursement factor of 3.05% for volumes
transported from Wyoming to California; the rates would be lower for shorter trips.
As for supply, given the large volume of remaining reserves and the amount of drilling activity in the
Rocky Mountain region, production could increase by more than 1.5 Bcf/day over the next year and by
4.5 Bcf/day over the next five years, according to a report prepared for Kern River by Barlow and Haun Inc.
In addition to the gas available from processing plants directly connected to Kern River in southwest-ern
Wyoming, shippers have access to supplies from other regions via Northwest Pipeline Corp., Colorado
Interstate Gas Co. and Questar Pipeline Co. at the Opal/Muddy Creek market center, the application said.
Two additional interstate pipelines - Wyoming Interstate Co. Ltd. and Overthrust Pipeline Co. - an-nounced
related open seasons in June that could result in interconnects providing access to supplies from
the Wind River and Wamsutter basins, the pipeline noted.
To meet the project's May 1, 2003, in-service date, Kern River asked the commission to issue a prelimi-nary
determination on nonenvironmental matters by Feb. 1, 2002, and a full certificate by May 1, 2002.",Daggett Wamsutter,$1.26 BILLION $1.26 billion,"FYI FERC Gas Daily Kern River Gas Transmission Co. Opal, Kern River Mojave Pipeline Co. Kern

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

The purpose of this email is to confirm that we will have a conference call 
this Wednesday, November 29 at 130 CT.  The following items have been 
suggested for the agenda:

Form of consent to assignment agreement (draft circulated) - to be used for 
LM's and Frames, if possible.
Assignment language - new language being tortured within the Enron ranks, to 
GE soon.
Limit of liability, indemnity, etc. - Enron owes GE a position on this.

In addition, it seems to me that the following equipment will be ""moving"" 
soon:

City of Austin LM's (to be assigned to ENA, then NEPCO)
LM's for the ESA project 
PSCO, LV CoGen, the remaining LM's, Pastoria, Blue Dog (all to DevCo, right?) 

I suggest that we address any commercial, financial or legal issues 
outstanding concerning the assignment of these turbines.

There may be others who need to be involved in the call, and there may be 
additional issues.  Please advise.

Things are going just fine here.  I'm looking forward to spring - baseball

I was in NYC last week.  I managed to get lost walking around Midtown.  I 
know, that's impossible.  I was talking on my cell and walking.  I walked 
from Bloomingdale's to somewhere east and slightly north of the theater 
district.  Oh, I should add I was headed to the Omni at 52nd and Madison.  
When I realized I was walking downhill with only warehouses ahead, it clicked

2319,"Kay, John Klauberg forwarded your email requesting a ""fatal flaw"" review 
under Connecticut law and also your question relating to the granting of a 
security interest under the agreement.  The agreement does not appear to have 
any ""fatal flaws"" with respect to enforceability under Connecticut law.  
There are no liquidated damages provisions or ""sole"" remedy provisions that 
are often times problematic.  The contract does contain a rather extensive 
force majeure provision which we have not fully analyzed under Connecticut 
law, but the provision appears to be reasonably drafted and should not be a 
problem.  If you would like, we can take a closer look at it for precedents 
under Connecticut law.

As to the granting of the security interest and the filing of financing 
statements, we think that these provisions are reasonable for this type of 
contract and merely provide the seller with a mechanism for perfecting its 
security interest.  I have attached a memorandum that addresses this issue 
under Connecticut law.  Please call me at the number set forth below if you 
have any questions regarding this email or the attached memorandum, or if I 
may be of any other assistance.

FERC staff proposes to have 6 weeks of meetings (up to 3 days per week) to discuss issues identified by the participants.   The purpose of the meetings is to try to develop consensus among industry participants on a standard interconnection agreement and procedures.  A list of issues is attached. This list was developed by EPSA and presented to FERC at last week's meeting.

At this week's meeting, the discussion will focus on the scope of interconnection rights and on interconnection study issues.  Donna Fulton will attend these meetings on behalf of Enron.  In preparation for the meetings, EPSA developed a position paper, which is attached.  Briefly, EPSA proposes:
 
    - Interconnecting Generator may elect, as part of its application for interconnection and study agreement, to be studied as an Energy Resource and/or as a Network/Capacity Resource; it may also request an ""optional deliverability"" study based on case-specific requirements.  The interconnecting generator may elect its level of interconnection following completion of the studies.
 
    - The rights of the interconnected generator will depend on the manner it is studied, the upgrades for which the generator has paid, and whether the transmission pricing system is based on physical rights or financial rights.
 
If you have any comments on the attached, please let me know as soon as possible.

different interpretation of accounting rules relating to power plants.  
Strangely enough, the change is one which should (I hope I hope) make power 
development projects easier.  In the past, we ran into problems anytime we 
wanted to build a power plant and take megawatts off of it.  Herman tells me 
that the current interpretation now focuses on the operation and maintenance 
of the plants, and not the power purchase agreement relating to the plant.  
This change in focus should make power development deals easier to 
structure.  

I would still like to set up an Intro to TurboPark meeting with Rose 
Engeldorf.  Rose is currently involved in a push a couple of deals in the

Hi,

	 	The power options trading desk is beginning to structure deals and to make markets in spark spread options ( options on the spreads between power prices and natural gas prices).  Please refer to the attached file for further information.   
	

 	   	It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.

   	
	 	 Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Howdy from Houston.  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  I took the week 
off and it was what i needed.  I have been working at a hectic pace and was 
on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.  I needed 
the break.  My international traveling is over for the year, thank God.

Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up.  
I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks co-ordinated 
and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go skiing.  We 
didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last discussion a 
while ago.  Our spring break is March 12-16th .

Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.  I figured that 
you are in Telluride right now on holiday.

Give my love to all.

Thanks for the email.  I have moved again within Enron.  I am now President 
and CEO (about 3 weeks ago) for Enron Global Markets, a new business unit 
within Enron's wholesale group.  This group is responsible for all Crude and 
Products, Coal, Emissions, Global Risk Mgt. (insurance), weather, LNG, F/X, 
interest rates, equities and agriculture.  It's a wild time yet again for the 
McConnell family.  It's nice to be back in the energy business.

Thanks for the email and quick response.  I am in the process of discussing 
this with various people.  A couple of observations that have become clear 
and  I want to pass them on to you.  Overall, the size of the transaction is 
not going to fly.  If we brought in other players and significantly reduced 
our exposure and the other players validated the technology and overall play, 
it would increase the odds that we are interested in this type of deal.  Rick 
Buy stated firmly that Jeff will not be interested in taking this type of 
deal to the board especially with what just happened with Ecogas and Kafus.

I called George last night and touched on these topics but they have been 
reconfirmed this morning.  I understand that the deal is very active and 
needs to move forward now, but I think we should inform Pacificorp that we 
will not take the entire deal.  Last night George stated that he may not want 
to tell them that and I agreed.  But upon reflection, I think that needs to 
be re-addressed.  The original deal size is DOA and if I really believe that, 
then not passing that information could hurt us in getting any size deal 
potentially closed with these guys.  Also having them assist in bringing 
others to the table might be beneficial.

I'll keep you informed as i move forward and learn more.

IN THE MONEY: Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron
By Michael Rapoport

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Hi
Thought I would drop you a quick note.  I do not know if your mom told you but I went back to work just over a week ago.  Wal-Mart is opening a new store here so I applied and got a job.  We are in the process of setting up the store, shelves etc. plus stocking them.  Lots of work but I have a good partner to work with.  It took us about three days to find eachother but we work well together and make sure we head for the same area each day.
Winter is here.  We have about 4 inches of snow so far.  It is only about -4 so not cold at all.  Not much news other than going back to  work so will run for now.  Drop me a line and let me know how all of the mess in New York has been effecting you.
Say hi to Beth for me as well.     
Lots of Love   Donna

Thank You!
 
During the upcoming week, the integration test team will be concentrating on resolving any outstanding issues for Estate and completing the Netco integration tests. For the most part, we will use the same test scripts used for Estate; the major differences are EOL and SAP. The plan is to complete the testing by end of day on Friday, January 18th.

Contact the Bridgeline 800-711-8000 (Code #3454709) from 7am - 7pm.  This will be the most effective of tracking, dispatching to the application representatives.  The integration test team will be monitoring and have access to the escalation procedures.

For those individuals who work in Unify, please remember to logoff and log back into Windows prior to accessing Unify. Please pass this information on to your co-workers.

2541,"Hey Guys. 

I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the 
ZP26/NP15 Buy-Resale on a Realtime basis. We are not doing a profit split 
this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to 
shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has 
Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the 
SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA's capacity is 21MW, 
but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know 
about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So 
by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA. 

The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. 
And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour. 

IN CAPS:
We sell to NCPA in ZP26.  
We buy from NCPA in NP15.

We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to 
ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL).
PG&E is NCPA's SC, so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call.



NCPA's tel#: (916) 786-3520
PG&E tel# : (415) 973-1969

2554,"
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

Attached please find the contracts for Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company.


  


These contracts have existed in the Global Contracts system.  Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.


We suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.  These contracts will feed to Unify accordingly.  Some of the contracts already have deals, which is indicated on the contract title or you can run the Sitara Report to locate the deals behind the contracts.  


If you need our assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Thank You.

2561,"With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and the size of your home.

2634,"To All Employees:

This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:

-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.


-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.

-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.

-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.

These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.

As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.

For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.

I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.

When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.

On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

How have you been?  Things are somewhat better on this end.  Glad to see that your are staying with UBS....so am I.

I always thought your first name is Phillip.  Where does the ""M"" fit in?

10/13/01, for a maintenance outage for about 20 days.  We are checking with
our contacts there for more details of the cause of the shutdown and will
report to you with those details and a more definitive forecast for restart.

After reviewing the list of NRC meetings coming up, Fred has notified me of
the two he thinks are of significance for attendance.  They are:

1. 11/30/01 - Surry 1, 2 - Discuss significance of failed piston wrist pins
& piston carrier bearings in the Number 3 Emergency Diesel Generator which
may have caused it to fail if needed to operate a long period.
HGP Comment: This may give insight on Surry 1 refueling and possible
shutdown of Surry 2 for mitigation of problem.  This will also impact other
plants with the same EDGs.

2. 12/12/01 - Ginna - Discuss status of RG&E evaluation regarding
circumferential cracking of the reactor vessel head penetration nozzles.
HGP Comment: This should provide info on whether Ginna will be required to
shutdown for inspection and additional info on other area PWRs concerning
shutdown inspection schedules.

Please let me know if you agree that we should attend. Currently we have
attended seven meetings of the eight allowed by the contract through
November.  None of the meetings for early December are of significance.  It
is highly unlikely that any significant meetings will be scheduled for late
December.  So, the above two meetings should probably be the last of
significance for the calendar year.

Just want to double check that Harry has declined the contract and offer letter from UBS.  

I have a letter that David handed over which states he was declining the contract, but wanted to remain an employee at will.

Sorry for double checking, but just wanted to close the loop.

Thanks!

2639,"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/27/01 Alexander, wh=
o has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He did=
n't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zero=
n Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a deeper league,=
 dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel F=
actor Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played i=
n Monday night's 24-17 l! os! s to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 y=
ards in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Water Boys Updated 11/27/01 Barl=
ow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. ""I=
t's throbbing,"" Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. ""I couldn't really slee=
p last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting."" Barlow is listed as=
 doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on res=
erve.     Terrell Owens , WR SF - Water Boys Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffere=
d a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle.=
 X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protective boot as a=
 precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he wi=
ll be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo.   Jeff=
 Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a hypere=
xtended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Mond=
ay, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight =
end has very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR! G! B -=
 Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three straig=
ht weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status =
for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy te=
am in any event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Davis=
, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out=
 what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his healt=
h, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut h=
im altogehter.   Jam! es! Stewart  , RB DET - South Park Cows Updated 11/27=
/01 Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Gr=
een Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time p=
osting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the la=
ck of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Ch=
arlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit=
 Free Press, Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despi=
te a groin injury. ""This is Charlie's offense,"" coach Marty Mornhinweg said=
. ""He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the inj=
ury) treated...I would expect him close to full spe! ed! Wednesday."" He'll =
likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is =
a risky proposition.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01=
 Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. T=
he veteran tight end is listed as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - T=
eam T-Bone Updated 11/27/01 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status =
for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if =
Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until lat=
er in the week.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover=
 (neck) will likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panther=
s are hopeful that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans=
.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsi=
stent play and 14 interceptions, Weinke'! s ! job as Carolina's No. 1 quart=
erback is secure. ""There've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very s=
uccessful that have gone through times like this,"" coach George Seifert tol=
d the Charlotte Observer. ""Even though there are a number of these plays th=
at haven't turned out and there have been disruptions in his play, I think,=
 ultimately, it will be more beneficial than not."" While he may be the star=
ting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fant=
asy leagues.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/27=
/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San Diego due to nagging hamstr=
ing injuries, is questionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. Ho=
wever, he is optimistic that he'll be available for the game. ""I'll be ther=
e,"" Sanders told the Arizona Republic. ""They're just real sore from doing a=
 lot of running and jumping - normal wear and tear."" In any event, keeping =
Sanders on your bench may be a good idea against the tough Oakland secondar=
y.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Moore (hamstring) was=
 supposed to begin some light running last week, but he ended up doing noth=
ing of the sort. ""He hasn't made a lot of progress,"" coach Dave McGinnis to=
ld the Arizona Republic. ""We're going to come to a point where we're going =
to ha! ve! to make a decision."" Moore, who has missed the entire season due=
 to injury, could be placed on the injured reserve list this week.   Olandi=
s Gary , RB DEN - Team T-Bone Updated 11/26/01 The Broncos placed Gary on i=
njured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This =
officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Dro=
p him from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Upd=
ated 11/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the secon=
d half of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did n=
ot throw a touchdown pass for the first time this season, however, and has =
been very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues =
to struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week =
12.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 It is unclear who=
 will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicago, as Batc=
h is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on Thursday. M=
ike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch can't go, =
but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough Bears seco=
ndary. We don't recommend an! y ! of the three for Week 12.  Quincy Carter =
, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday that Ca=
rter will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Sunday's=
 game against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season for D=
allas, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don'=
t recommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Team =
T-Bone Updated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesota =
with a pulled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroit.=
 Keep an eye on his progress during practice this week before you make a fi=
nal decision on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Update=
d 11/26/01 Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hams=
tring problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game aga=
inst San Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on =
him for Week 12.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Water Boys Updated 11/26/01 Graham =
suffered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is=
 day to day.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/26/0=
1 Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore wi=
ll elevate Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi Aya=
nbadejo as a backup.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Water Boys Updated 11/26/01 Ba=
rlow dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not =
been determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Money Shots Updated 11/26/01=
 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is da=
y to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/26/01 Warrick=
 is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was=
 taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinna=
ti's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , ! QB! CIN - Addison Red Cornh=
oles Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals desp=
ite being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ine=
ffective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the ga=
me. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now. =
 Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caug=
ht six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the l=
evel of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down=
 the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , =
RB JAC - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and =
two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his=
 good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Q=
adry Ismail , WR BAL - South Park Cows Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Is=
mail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performan=
ce, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of t=
he most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  More Updates  [IMAGE=

2660," I received a call from Jack Foley from the PG&E Credit Risk area regarding concerns to their exposure from TW. He cited that due to the' CC' S & P rating they had concerns regarding their monthly prepayment to TW of approximately $ 1.8 M, our marketing of their excess capacity, and the Operating Agreement at the interconnect regarding indemnification of the PCB cleanup.
He stated that PG&E has exposure as a result of TW marketing their excess capacity which at present TW has paid PG & E it's portion. However, we are due to remarket in January for their Spring/Summer capacity where we bill, collect and remit to PG &E. Also, he advised that per the Operating Agreement at the interconnect, dated June 27, 1995, there is an indemnification for PCB cleanup and that we pay PG & E $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 per year and the agreement runs to 2007. He added that there is a reaffirmation of the 1995 agreement dated May 28,1999, with Steve and Lou as the signers. 

In order to alleviate their concerns, Foley proposed, 1) TW drop the prepayment requirement and 2) provide security/collateral to secure the remarketing and PCB cleanup.

Please review and advise your comments.

We are making solid progress on a number of fronts. From a 10,000 foot pers=
pective, our main goal is to pull together all of the systems, curves, prod=
uct descriptions/offerings, internal communications, and external communica=
tions of a fully functional business unit for presentation to Belden, Richt=
er, Herndon and Presto by November 15. This morning, I spoke with Juli Salv=
agio who manages marketing for Enron Wholesale about getting the Renewable =
Power Desk space on the enron.com website. Take a look at the products and =
services offerings section of enron.com, and check out emissions trading or=
 weather derivatives. The goal is to draft language (with photos -- ideas??=
) for an RPD site along those same lines. I will take an initial shot at th=
e language (with a fundamental breakdown between wholesale and retail servi=
ces) and then send around drafts for your comment the week of October 24.  =
I think we will be listed under the heading ""Renewable Power Marketing"" or =
""Green Power Marketing"" (Which do you think is better?)=20

On other fronts:

Team Fundies is cranking along well.
Richard and I are working to clean up all of our existing positions (scrubb=
ing old EES contracts, managing inter-book issues so that any existing gree=
n tag positions fall out to the Green Desk).
Our Product Description has been professionalized by Enron Counsel (Richard=
 Ring) and we are talking to wind, biomass, landfill and geothermal develop=
ers with good offers on tags.
We are working with EWS counsel and EES counsel to prepare a formal green t=
ag contract that can be attached to either a standard EWC commodity contrac=
t or an EES commodity contract.
Stacey is roaming the country making the world safe for Green Tag trading -=
- she is preparing a regional summary of green tag/Green issues/protocols.
We continue to negotiate with LADWP for a services contract for their new r=

afternoon.  I know it was helpful to go through the Synthetic Lease 
assumptions with everyone on board.  I met with Dave yesterday evening and 
briefly discussed his timing (ASAP) on meeting with Joe Sutton and his 
expectations (very high) on the Moore presentation.  I referenced oversizing 
the amount of the Synthetic Lease in order to keep the Canadian banks happy 
on the 90% Enron guarantee.  He agreed that the economics in the dash should 
still reflect the lower actual amount to be drawn down (currently U.S. 
$169MM).  Please note below his requests and delegated responsibilities in 
(brackets) below: 

Dave requested I revise the proposal (Adam) to show add'l NPV and IRR 
comparisons based on MAIN, ComEd and possibly ICF, and a 30 Yr, GENCO 
comparison (Kate).  Given the recent downward shift in some of the curves we 
may need to recompute our existing NPV and IRR #'s also (Kate).  Besides 
furnishing a graph for the referenced curves, I need to submit GENCO's 
capital cost comparison for peakers in the marketplace (Ben).  Further, based 
on the 30 year amortization, I need to show a graph of the build up of the 
components of capacity price and a break even earnings accrual price 
(Miguel).  I will need comparisons from GENCO of these two graphs as well as 
a chart comparing start costs, heat rate and Var. O&M contrasting the Moore 
Project with the GENCO peakers (Don and/or Jynsung or Clement or Ben).  In 
addition, Dave asked to get a Draft copy of the DASH ASAP (Chip).  Dave does 
not want to circulate the DASH for signature until he has met with Sutton.

I finally got a chance to talk to Entergy about their merchant peaker in 
their own service territory.  Specifics are as follows:

Configuration: 4 x GE 7EA's at 72 - 73 MW each because of elevation and 
humidity levels.
Location: Vicksburg, MS sharing a site with the Baxter Wilson plant (1320 MW 
coal/gas fired boiler)
HHV: 12,200 btu/kwh
Pipe: A new intra-state that will be shared with the Baxter Wilson plant.  
Existing sources are Koch and Duke.
Start date: 7/01
Permits: PSD permit at 9 ppm.  No run hour limitation.
Taxes: Fee in lieu of taxes at 1/3 cost for first ten years.  Full property 
taxes thereafter.  Entergy claims this is the same deal Ben Jacoby got for 
our peaker in MS.

First we need to model a pro-forma of plant operating costs using estimates 
of FOM and VOM from internal sources.
Second, we need to calculate spread option valuations of the underlying plant 
for 20-years using curve, vol and correlation assumptions acceptable to the 
desk.
Thirdly and based on 20-year plant valuations, I need to create a debt 
service schedule.
Finally, we have to price the put option premium and sensitivities using the 
research/structuring model.

Any questions, please call me at 3-4750.

Just to quickly address your questions in advance of our call in the
morning, I offer the following:

1.  The debt amount contemplated was based on assumptions given by Enron.
The rate given was $375 /kW or $120MM in debt.  This would be obtained via
a 144A Bond offering without any subdebt.

2.  There are three operating fees listed in the proforma currently:
Management fee ($600k/yr) to the Owners as contracted, O&M Fee ($300k/yr)
to the Operator contemplated to be TECO Power Services (""TPS"") and the TPS
Parts Company for a spare engine.  The TPS Spare engine may be eliminated
provided we can get comfort via other methods.  The financing fees were
estimates based on discussions with Enron and our engaging CSFB.

3.  The Maintenance Reserve account is accrued based on operating hours of
the plant and planned major maintenance, as estimated by TPS (the O&M
Operator).  This reserve may be eliminated as we currently are estimating
that this plant will never reach a major outage.

I look forward to discussing these issues with you in the morning.

2737,"Hello,

As you know, this week I met with S&P on Wednesday and Moody's on Thursday.  
S&P had three people there including Peter Rigby and William Chew (MD 
infrastructure finance) and Moody's had eight people there including Susan 
Abbot (MD corp. finance, power group).  I thought the meetings went very 
well.  There was an active dialogue during both presentations and a lot of 
questions were asked.  The stated objective for both meetings was that Enron 
has gone as far as we can with our product development working in a vacuum, 
and that we feel we have developed a structure that covers the dominant 
outstanding risk that merchant generators are exposed to (market prices), and 
that we think this is enough to achieve an investment grade rating, but if 
not then what more do we need.  Both gave me no commitments but promised to 
give me preliminary feedback next week.

We e-mailed copies of the presentation to both of you yesterday.

I suggest a conference call between Enron, Linda and Tom...maybe Tuesday next 
week to discuss the rating agency meetings in more detail and to discuss 
where we are in product and project development.

The lawyers are continuing to refine and discuss my proposed structure.  Key 
issues seem to be potential treatment of my two contract structure in 
bankruptcy and whether or not my contracts are considered insurance.  I will 
keep you posted as we go.

Let me know what times are good for you.

regards,

state.  The Doyle project actually needs to be changed to ""In Operation"" as 
it is now going through its run tests.  The Athens, GA site should be labeled

2747,"My responses to one set of PG&E questions would be as follows.  Dean is 
answering the other one and will send back to you directly.

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.

RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling 
coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the 
time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever 
arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.



* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?

RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been 
executed, but has been ""put on the shelf"" awaiting decision on successful 
bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder 
and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.

  o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.

  o West LB has control of the turbines.  They can be assigned either to the 
LLC or to ENA.  (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for 
the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)  If 
assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the 
turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.   



* They also questioned whether there would be any ""agricultural
restrictions""?

RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to 
maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern 
County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to 
allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period.  
However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce 
the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the 
request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has 
until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming 
support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will 
be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson 
Act cancellation fee.

 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA 
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it 
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate for my disability.  After talking with you 
and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right 
place to continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this 
level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the 
Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University 
Graduate School of Business.  
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a 
pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and 
finance in the future.  Also, if you can think of anything else I can do to 
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

Let me let you in on a little secret my man -- you ain't gettin' no break
from the Luke man when 2 pops out, nor are you getting a break from Luke
and/or Daniel Jr. when no 3 is born. There are no breaks to be had in the
parenting arena for about 20 years.

Point 2 -- It pains me so to make this statement, but Stamas might actually
be able to beat me in basketball now since I have no cartilage in my left
knee. The Dr. says that my running days are over (which was obviously a
serious blow to my lifestyle), but more importantly, he said that my

2800,"One hundred and forty two hours ago, I wandered into the Houston Casino, not 
really sure why other than a free floating anxiety that could only be 
appeased by attending to the ministerial tasks in life that so frequently 
make us forget how good life is.  So after a rousing game of tennis on Friday 
morning while my children were frolicking with Dede's 3 children at the 
Houston Country Club, I tackled my desk and made head way to no where. After 
trashing 457 emails, I opened the the 458th.  And then it came to me.  An 
epic. A history. A sense of time, commitment and value. A place where my 
roots are (as you all know, my mom and dad are buried in a family graveyard 
200 feet from the only barn not burned in the Shenandoah valley during the 
Civil War and which was used a Yankee hospital).  And of course there is the 
hope of sustaining energy to cope with this lackluster, stressful career in 
the Casino. 

And the Gods must have seen this coming too.  Being meager and always wanting 
to commit small, I sought only volume 1 of the opus.  Not to be found.  
Plenty of volume 2s and 3s but not a volume 1 to be found.  Other than in the 
sole, 3 volume set, neatly packages in the box, high up on a lonely shelf.  I 
knew I was on the right track when the person behind me tried to grab it out 
of my hands.  I fought and won.

I'm now on page 32 having met Jefferson Davis and Dear Abe.  At this rate 
I'll be finished in about 4 years, a true history of the war.

call, particularly section 5 of Schedule 2 (PX Clearinghouse, Credit

Tariff No. 2.  Because of the former mandate that the IOUs (now excluding 
SDG&E) buy power only from the  PX, Edison and PG&E have procured ISO 
real-time services, not directly, but through the PX's Core Services.  To the 
extent that any PX participant defaults on its payment obligation to the PX 
for real-time ISO services and the default exceeds the sum of the (1) 
participant's collateral (5.2.1), (2) the Pool Performance Bond (5.2.2), and 
any set off from liquidating the defaulting participant's positions in the 
DA, DO, and CTS markets, the remaining or residual default amount is 
expressly chargeable to all other non-defaulting participants using the 
proportional chargeback methodology of the tariff (5.3).  This is different 
from my conclusion from yesterday with respect to an Edison or PG&E default 
in the CTS market solely for the reason that the proportional chargeback is 
expressly provided for in the PX tariff for Core Services, while (as 
explained in my 1/18/01 memo) it is not provided for in the CTS tariff or 
rate schedule.

Some of the invoices that I have seen to some of our other clients simply 
provide a lump sum proportional chargeback, without specifying whether it is 
for Core Services, CTS or both.   If you receive such an invoice, try to 
confirm whether any of it is for a participant's default on a CTS obligation

Kathy Patrick began Nolan's deposition today.? It was Nolan's first 
deposition and he seemed a little uncomfortable.? Nolan was overly cautious 
and at times evasive.? The highlights of the day were as follows:

--Nolan did not see the offering memo until he reviewed it on the way to 
Thailand in April '98.? Nolan was not privy to any discussions or road show 
presentations regarding the Notes prior to the closing (When Nolan was 
confronted with communications between himself and Serge Deslise of NSM in 
Jan. '98, he claimed he could not recollect why he would be communicating 
with NSM prior to the closing).

--When Nolan arrived in Thailand, he found a mill that appeared to be state 
of the art, but lacked raw materials and funds to produce steel.

--Nolan soon found that the Mill had serious engineering and management 
problems. 

--NSM had no financial controls until Aug. 98 when Stickler instituted a 
policy of requiring two signatures on disbursements.

Kathy spent a good deal of the day on an e-mail ""situation report"" sent by 
Nolan to Busse in May '98 discussing numerous problems with the Electric Arc 
Furnace, the Degasser and other parts of the mill.

Enron/ECT came up during the early portion of the deposition.? Patrick asked 
Nolan if he recalls discussing any aspect of the Mill with Brian Barth.? 
Nolan said he could not recall.? Patrick then asked him if he thought? Barth 
was an honest and competent person.? Nolan answered affirmatively.? It 
appears that Kathy is trying to lay the foundation for information she 
received from Brain during her interview. If Kathy continues focusing on 
Brian, however, it may begin to appear quite obvious to the other defendants 
that she has received information from Brian.?

2826,"California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=

market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20

er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=

California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20

2830,"We had the shortest call in history today.  We discussed Edison.  Edison
withdrew its opposition to our employment of professionals and will be
producing documents in response to our 2004 notice.  There's been some
speculation about whether parties will be filing an involuntary petition
against SCE.  Reliant wasn't on our call today and I couldn't help but
wonder whether they were busy with other things.  In that regard, Howard
Weg is establishing an SCE subcommittee and wants us to participate.
What's your position.  As to Edison, there's a reasonable likelihood now
that the legislature will approve a package that (1) has no funding to pay
us, (2) permits Edison to use funds to pay dividends on preferred stock and
(3) waives Edison's commandeering claims.  As to the last issue, Kaye
Scholer opines that Edison's waiver will have no impact on the PX's right
to pursue the commandeering suit.  This week there will be several meetings
aimed at finalizing a reorganization plan.  We'll have a report during our
next call which is scheduled Sept,. 17 at 1 LA time.  Weg is consulting
with FERC lawyers about presentation of his proposed settlement.  He plans

The ""transmissionless"" transactions that we developed business practice #11
around are CA to CA interchanges.  Historically, participants at the MIDC
would track purchases and sales of energy between each other as scheduled
interchange between their control areas.  The participants all have owned
and/or contracted transmission to/from their systems.  

When tagging came along, authoring PSEs for these MIDC deals just wanted to
do a tag with one source control area and once sink control area with no
transmission segments.  There could be a dozen marketers (thus, a dozen
title transfers) in the chain, but the tag would not indicate transmission,
just interchange between source and sink CAs (limited to CA participants at
the MIDC).  

At some point (1.5 or 1.6?) E-Tag required a tag to contain at least one
transmission segment.  The WSCC approached the IS to allow for no
transmission segments in a tag.  We were told no.  So, the business practice
of picking the source (or the sink) CA's TP to provide a MIDC-MIDC
transmission segment was adopted. 

Hope answers your question.

2848,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

what's on there is still available.  It shows we have 3 sets of Daytona's

Date: 1853
1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others

We got to talking about you at lunch today.  Rudy mentioned that in effort to 
get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him 
by consuming
so much of his time requesting reports.  My understanding is that your 
typical response to this is ""I am the most altruistic person.""  I am sure you 
recognize the hypocrisy 
laden in this statement.  If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not 
care if his acts are recognized or not.  In fact, the true altruist hopes 
only that his acts benefit
those to which they are directed.  We may have to downgrade you to ""concerned 
individual"".

like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr.

film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic,

The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of 
the Century list,
and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List..

FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply 
haven't sent one out in the past two weeks.  I will make sure you both 
receive my next

complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of

over Christmas she kept trying to tell my 8-months pregnant sister all kinds 
of delivery-room horror stories!  I finally had to yell at her to get her to

2876,"Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my 
comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a 
draft to send around to the usual suspects.  

1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs 
of the acquired capacity.  

 -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue 
associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to 
other shippers.  
 - Net costs will be separately recorded.

2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access 
to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to 
limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to 
other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain 
the ""no tying"" part).

3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  

 - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
 - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or 
advantage to any affiliated entity.

4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's 
customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  

 - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods 
in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM 
shippers should be minimal.  
 - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly 
preferential treatment of TW.

5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing 
open access operations?  

 - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to 
transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco 
Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with 
TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's 
tariff.  
 - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS 
(right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on 
TW's system.  
 - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be 
able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service 
agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with 
PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of 
likely scenarios.

6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new 
facilities?  

 - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan 
Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of 
prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the 
PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives 
available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to 
transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to 
delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding 
the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by 
effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's 
system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable 
both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.

you tell us whether there are any counterparties that aren't signing this

2892,"Tana, the products listed below (as I understand) comprise the initial 
products for the EOL roll-out.  It is unusual that ECTRIC, rather than ENA, 
will be the Enron party, even with respect to transactions that will be 
confirmed out of the U.S.  This is something Mark and I (as well as tax and 
credit) have scrubbed at length and approved.


Enron principal counterparty for each: ECTRIC
Each product is a financially-settled swap (NO OPTIONS)

(1) Coffee swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(2) Coffee swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from London)
(3) Coffee basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(4) Sugar swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(5) Sugar swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from London)
(6) Sugar basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(7) Cocoa swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(8) Cocoa swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from London)
(9) Cocoa basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)

I will immediately look into whether there would be special restrictions for 
swaps on coffee, sugar and cocoa with respect to Australian, Singapore and 
Hong Kong counterparties (I think these are the three most likely non 
U.S./European jurisdictions at this point)

NEW RULE 9.11A (=01&Give-Up Trades=018)

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the=
=20
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing=
=20
Members, the following rules shall define the respective=20
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The =01&executi=
ng=20
broker=018, as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member =
Firm=20
or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)   Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its=20
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up f=
or=20
a customer=01,s account from an executing broker, provided however, that th=
e=20

Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be=20
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice=
=20
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (=01&DK=018) a trade on=
ly if: =20
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of=
=20
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing=
=20
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for whi=
ch=20
the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a basis for=
=20
rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions o=
f=20
Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred=
=20
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and=
=20
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. =
=20
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing=20
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B) Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1) Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once=
=20
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker=01,s clerk must:

(a) confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b) accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c) confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as=20
practicable; and
(d) transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as=20
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2. Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing=
=20
broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with=
=20
the broker=01,s obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remain=
s=20
responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules.

3.  Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member =20
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order=
=20
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the=20
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g) the account number;
(h) the brokerage rate;
(i) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with=
=20
the executing broker for that account; and
(j) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that=20
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifi=
cs=20
of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time,=
=20
and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information=
=20
shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4. Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed=20
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in=
=20
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker=01,s discret=

2908,"As of this week EnronOnline has just started offering US/Canadian Dollar 
Swaps Online.  As part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can 
transact these products online I look at the Financial Trading Agreement 
Database to see if there are any restrictions indicated, check the master 
swap agreement, and I am also looking at any Board Resolutions we might have 
received when we got the master agreement executed. 

What I am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions 
evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative 
transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to 
enter into currency transactions.  Since transacting these currency 
transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us I 
just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to 
rely solely on the ""Restrictions"" contained in Lotus Notes.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1. OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as accuratel=
y=20
as possible all futures and options gross positions as of close-of business=
=20
on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the estimated current gros=
s=20
positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.  The OPC must be=20

2.   OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring optio=

automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted=
=20
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its=
=20
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other=20
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic abandonme=
nt=20

(a) An E/A form must be submitted not later than 5:00 PM.
(b) Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which are=
=20
subject to automatic
Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in strike prices whic=
h=20

(c) If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a strike=
=20
price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position in a=
=20
strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify Clearing =
by=20

(d) CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy to=
=20
assure submission  of the CM's E/A forms.

If=20
some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for position=
=20
liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of expiration=
=20
and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your projected=20
position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of actual traded=
=20
volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel correction=

se=20
and Abandonment instructions, the projected number of exercises and maximum=

potential assignments for each strike price, the type of exercise (manual o=
r=20
automatic), whether the strike is In, At or Out of the money, and the=20

day of expiration.

2. TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all expiring=

B) At approximately 5:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,=20
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to=20

series.  Please check this statement carefully.  Although long options=20
positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be automatically exercised,=
=20
not all short option positions will be assigned if there are any options=20
manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note that there also may =
be=20
some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E) At approximately 9:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be=20
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is=20
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginnin=
g=20

=20

as it made our lives much easier and our jobs much more productive.  As 
always, I am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom 
you are so well connected.  At the moment, we are trying to finalize an 
internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently 
affecting our business in Argentina.  I would appreciate your comment on the 
following two items:

(1)  Can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification (not 
sure which it is) that ""financial institutions"" are taxed (Gross Receipts) on 
the spread?  Is it possible to see a copy? (I can probably have it translated)

(2)  I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to 
Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement (crossborder trades) or a 
local master swap agreement (local trades).  Execution of the master 
agreement itself does not evidence any transaction.  Even when any 
transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by 
either party until termination of the deal.  Brent thinks that the tax will 
be based on the product of the [Fixed Price  X volume X term] even though the 
master agreement will merely provide for netting.  Can you verify?

When I sent you the following message on April 12th, I thought it was clear 
that Enron Australia Finance Pty Limited should not act as principal for 
entering into the non-power futures agreement with ABN AMRO.  Sorry for the 
confusion.  Rather, ABN AMRO should enter into the agreement with ENA.  
(Shane should only enter into trades under the futures agreement acting 
pursuant to the services agreement.  Of course, based on David's e-mail 
messages, it appears that the services agreement needs to be executed 
following resolution of the questions regarding the mark-up.)

Note further that as stated in my September 9, 1999 memo that I sent you in 
the April 12th e-mail (and that is re-attached below), our Australian tax 
advisor advised that if a master contract must be executed in Australia, it 
should be executed by an independent agent (such as a lawyer) having a power 
of attorney from ENA.

Hope this helps.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any further 
questions.

I talked to Chuck Kaufman and he had the following concerns from a credit 
standpoint:

1) Cross Default-  He wanted to lower Enron's cross default to $50MM to equal 
the amount for Cinergy.  I informed him, this amount has been set by our 
banks and the Enron Treasurer feels the $100MM is justified.  He has agreed 
to keep the amounts as they are.

2) Guaranty's and Guaranty/Collateral Thresholds-  
    a) Enron outgoing Guaranty-  Enron currently gives a $10MM guaranty to 
cover two Cinergy entities, Cinergy Marketing and Cinergy Capital. In my 
credit          worksheet I asked that Enron give them an additional $10MM 
guaranty to cover this ISDA specifically with the intention of amending the 
existing guaranty  to remove Cinergy Marketing.  After speaking to Chuck I 
have agreed to tie the existing guaranty to this contract and not use the 
additional guaranty at all.  
 Please tie the existing guaranty to the ISDA, I will forward a copy of that 
guaranty to you, so it can be used as and exhibit.

   b) Enron incoming Guaranty-  Enron currently receives a $10MM guaranty 
from Cinergy Corp which guaranty's Cinergy Marketing and Cinergy Capital for 
both  physical and financial products.  I allocated $2MM of this guaranty to 
the ISDA with a $2MM collateral threshold.  Chuck wanted to see their 
threshold  increased to $10MM.  I told them I would agree to this if we 
received an increase in their guaranty to allow for cushion for other 
business outside of this  ISDA.  He is going to put this requested increase 
to $12MM into their corporate office.  This being said, please increase the 
collateral threshold  for Cinergy Marketing to $10MM.

Can you please incorporate these changes into the ISDA, and once I hear that 
Chuck has confirmed the increase in the Guaranty amount to Enron I will 
notify you to send execution copy's to him, assuming all the legal issues 
have been resolved.

The dollar is trading near its one-week highs vs. the yen, around 135, as t=
he markets expressed their pessimism about Japanese economic outlook and co=
ncern that the government and the BoJ are behind the curve in boosting the =
growth. The BoJ left interest rates unchanged last week and did not announc=
e any new measure to fight inflation and boost the growth. Even the governm=
ent was hoping that the central bank would decide to raise purchases of JGB=
s or take other measures to pump more liquidity into the system. The Nihon =
Keizai reported that the government could inject more than10 trln yen until=
 September, but with request that the central bank further ease monetary po=
licy. Economic Minister Takenaka said that the plan could also deal with th=
e launch of government fund to buy shares that banks hold in other companie=
s. Finance Minister Shiokawa said Friday that he wants MoF to provide aroun=
d 2 trln yen to buy stocks from banks and asked the central bank to raise m=
onthly bond purchases to 1 trln yen. At G-7 meeting BoJ Governor Hayami sai=
d the central bank will support PM Koizumi's reforms  as much as possible .=
 Support is viewed at 133.40, 133.0 and 132.65. Resistance is seen at 135.1=
5 and 135.50.    At G7 Finance Minister's Meeting held this weekend in Otta=
wa, Canada, ministers showed enthusiasm about the US growth and said the ec=
onomic outlook has improved since their last meeting. The G-7 did not talk =
about the weak yen and markets could be prompt to believe that fin minister=

____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the March 2002 options contract for Copper (HXH2)
and Aluminum (OAH2) is Monday, February 25, 2002.
	GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

	TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


Trading in the March 2002 Copper and Aluminum Options Contracts will cease
at 1:00 P.M. and 1:10 p.m. respectively on February 25, 2002.  All Brokers
and Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions to
exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.

On Monday, February 25, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Monday's submissions and processing will be
available on Tuesday morning February 26, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.


				CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

		Please note: Trade information reflected on the option
expiration report and transaction listing are trades submitted only. To
inquire whether trades have matched, each CM must review the trade reports
provided by COMEX's On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.","Michael Campanelli __ David

3058,"Here are the credit worksheets for Valentis (25% of the trade and Independent 
amount should be allocated here) and CD Holdings (75% allocated here).  This 
will work for the ISDA, and I am hearing from Caroline that they are ok with 
posting this up front amount in cash.  So, for purposes of the Deemed ISDA, 
we may as well include all of the credit provisions, but make the $2MM a 
""Special Independent Amount"" applicable to the counterparty, which may be 
increased by Enron up to $5MM. This Special Independent Amount should be 
added to the Independent Amount as that term is used in the ISDA in order to 
give us the ability to demand more collateral at will with respect to the 
long term hedge.  Given the fact that the c/p can post cash instead of LC's I 
see no reason for us to always have the Special Independent Amount in cash.  
That is, if we are $2MM out of the money on the position, I do not have a 
problem returning their cash, so long as it is in increments of the rounding 
amount. 

So I think we should just go ahead and put credit into these Deemed ISDAs, 
and require that the failure of the parties to execute an ISDA within 60 days 
will constitute a termination event.

Caroline, again, the c/p will have to verbally agree to Loss instead of 
market quotation, to the special margining provisions with respect to this 
particular long term trade, etc.  Let's discuss how this will work, since it 
is different from what I proposed on the phone.

I have a couple quick comments on the letter you sent this morning.  In
general, we need to make clear that we are replacing the credit support
provider under the ISDA.  Otherwise, I am concerned that we could face a
possible default under the ISDA once the VRI parental guaranty is

simplistic approach would be to terminate the existing swaps in Raptor 2 and 
execute new swaps at the same time and on the same terms in Raptor 4. 

Unless anyone objects, I propose that we proceed along the lines outlined

Each intercompany entity can go to a web site and click on a button that says 
they agree to be bound by the terms of the 1997 ISDA between RMT and their 
company (assuming they  have one, or course!)  They could then enter a site 
which would display the economic terms of each deal they had traded that 
day.  They would have to click a ""confirmed"" button next to each deal, as 
opposed to one button for the entire day.  If they disagreed with a deal, 
they could click a ""Do not agree"" button, which could then bring them to an 
email screen, where they could alert us to the discrepancy.  

What kinds of issues would this raise from a tax/legal perspective?  Would 
this have the same effects as a legal document?  Do you have some time where 
we could get together and discuss potential issues?  Thanks.",Sara,,RMT
3078,"Sara,
In response to your questions below:

1. Rod Nelson will be handling credit as the deal is now being executed by 
ENA.

2. Tax is being handled by Steve Jacobson in the London office ( he is our US 
tax person )

3. Accounting is Matt Landy

4. The confirmations are being handled by Kim Theriot and John Wilson is the 
trader who will be signing on behalf of ENA. We have a call with them today 
at 3.00pm UK time  so if there is any change I will let you know.

5. We are still waiting for the term sheet / confirms from TD and are 
expecting them this afternoon. I will forward them to you asap.

6. TD have proposed using the 98 ISDA which I believe is already in place 
with ENA and TD Texas.

7. This is just one transaction with 3 individual wti swaps, two of which are 
with Enron, Enron/TD , TD/Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley/ Enron

I will send you the transaction diagram from TD and the ISDA agreement.

If there is anything else you need please feel free to call me on 0207 783

confirm that Macleod Dixon will be providing an opinion regarding Swapco but 
that Enron will not require an opinion from Macleod Dixon as to RBC.

My understanding of the currently outstanding issues relating to this 
transaction are as follows:

1.  Increased cost/change in law indemnification
2.  Swapco using its best efforts to replace lendor in the event of 
illegality (ie. no ECC obligation)
3.  Calculation of optional pre-payment amounts
4.  Incorporation of syndication language, including pricing changes 
resulting from syndication, into the Schedule to the interest rate swap

3148,"Rick, 

As I understand it, you wanted our wish list of what we would like (within 
the confines of Enron).  Here's my wish list:

1.  The business units within Enron are very segmented and that can prevent 
the cross-pollination of solutions for customers.  For example, if we could 
put together a program that linked commodity sales for a variety of customer 
sizes of load with load control devices and the offering of curtailable 
products, it would create a mechanism to 1) provide savings/income to 
customers during peak periods, 2)make power available to Enron during peak 
periods for resale and 3) help modulate the potential for outages and 
insufficient capacity.   The packaging of other energy efficiency services 
could also be considered in conjunction with this.

2. Coupled with and also apart from suggestion #1 above, Enron should 
increase its marketing of renewable products.  By doing so it would 1)work in 
hand with a curtailable program, by freeing up generation during a hot peak 
day - if photovoltaics are used, 2)enhance Enron's image in the community, 
3)serve a market niche.

3.  Have the opportunity to add two more wishes.

4. Coupled with and apart from suggestions #1 and 2 above, Enron should focus 
more on distributed generation alternatives which can 1) provide significant 
savings to customers since in many states stranded costs are not assessed on 
DG, 2) can be used as a source of energy during a peak period by paying the 
customer a premium to curtail and make the power available to Enron to sell 
on the market 3) help offset the problem of delivering power into a 
constrained control area where there is dg power we can tap into.

5. Create a forum within government affairs to collectively brainstorm and 
develop strategies to implement the needs of Enron's business units.  Clear 
identification of the goals and problem solving not only provide good 
solutions through the contribution of diverse viewpoints, but it is also an 
excellent learning experience for all participants as a clearer understanding 
of the goals emerge.  Also, participants can take with them a better 
understanding of what may be achievable, while others may  pick up ideas that 
can be reshaped and used in their jurisdictions.  

I hope this is in line with what you were looking for.  If not, please let me 
know and I'll ask for three more wishes.

         ?Filing Due June 18th

Attached are draft EPSA comments in response to the Commission's proposed 
requirements on natural gas sales to the California market.  The Commission 
is proposing that market participants (including pipelines and LDCs) submit 
quarterly reports on price and volume data on physical transactions.   EPSA's 
comments focus on four key issues:

   ?The reporting requirements represent an unnecessary burden;

   ?The information requested has proprietary and confidential aspects;

   ?Increased reporting requirements will not adequately address gas
    infrastructure needs in California; and

   ?If reporting requirements are imposed, a sunset date should provide a
    definite end to the filing obligation.

As discussed on the Gas Issues Working Group call on June 7th, members asked 
that EPSA file these comments.

Comments are due at FERC on Monday, June 18th.  In order to ensure we file on 
time, please forward any comments by noon on Friday, June 15th to Jack Cashin

3154,"I just had the opportunity to review a report issued by the ICC assessing 
retail and wholesale competition in Illinois.  If you would like a hard copy, 
let me know.  Salient facts/ conclusions are as follows:

1.  Switching rates are high in Com Ed territory only.  By end of 2000, 22% 
of eligible customers had switched, representing 62% of usage. Larger usage 
customers are switching with greater frequency than smaller usage customers.  
Approximately 40% of delivery service customers were using the PPO.  Approx. 
8 marketers are active in Com Ed with only 3or 4 acquiring significant 
numbers of customers.

2.  ICC believes retail prices may increase dramatically in 2005 by the time 
the general rate freeze expires.

3.  ICC is concerned about wholesale competition noting that utilization of 
the PPO evidences little physical delivery by suppliers.  ICC is also 
concerned about the ability of the Illinois transmission system to support a 
competitive wholesale market within and between utilities.  The number of 
TLR's attained record levels last years and there are concerns about managing 
load pockets.  If the situation remains unchanged, retail prices will be 
higher than they would have been had the market structure supported wholesale 
competition.

4.  Non-Coincident Peak demand in Illinois in 1999 was 29,561Mw and 28,040MW 
in 2000, however overall growth in demand is 1.4%.

5. The most successful suppliers are either Illinois utilities or affiliates 
of Illinois gas and electric utilities, raising market power concerns.

6.  ICC is investigating the capacity of the Illinois utilities' transmission 
and distribution systems.  As part of the study, the ICC will be developing a 
comprehensive computer simulation model of the regional transmission grid to 
identify problem spots on the grid including potential load pockets as well 
as inter-utility constraints that may limit wholesale deliveries during 
critical peak hours.  This will assist in state and federal proceedings.

7.  The ICC is concerned about the market power exercised by utilities and 
has been collecting data  on each utility's interconnection and transmission 
queues to watch for signs of favoritism directed towards their affiliates  or 
any other violations of FERC Order 888.

Hope this is useful.

were independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with 
neighboring business practices.  

At the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC 
technical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal 
of the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when 
he instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address 
interregional coordination.

The key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's 
active participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a 
non-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on 
OASIS Phase II.  

By working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing, 
Enron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS 
Phase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the 
earlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference. 

Govt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical 
Conference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.

 The budget allocation provided that 15% of our budget would go to Europe.  
On their behalf we have been heavily engaged on Trakya where arrearages have 
gotten as high as $150 million.  The strategy for countering this situation 
has been Washington based and two pronged - utilize the lenders, especially 
OPIC and EXIM which are both USG agencies, to drive an effort to call on the 
Turkish Treasury guarantee, and to mobilize the US government as a matter of 
policy and in the context of the IMF funding to insist that the Turks clean 
up their energy sector.  Both elements of the strategy have been recently 
successful with the consequence that about $60 million has been paid over the 
last several weeks.  I anticipate as the strategy plays out over the next 
month to six weeks we should see payments of an equivalent or greater 
amount.  Since my office has the relationship with OPIC and EXIM we have the 
lead across the government on this issue.  We also anticipate that there will 
be some work on the Spanish and Polish projects in the future. 
 In light of all of this perhaps we should increase Europe's allocation.

EDF Pursues Italy's Montedison; 
Lack of Reciprocity Still a Factor  

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]Power giant Electricit,de France (EDF) has sent shock waves through 
Italian financial markets and government ministries by attempting to raise 
its stake in electric firm Montedison to 20 percent from about 6 percent. 
However, Romano Prodi, the European Union commissioner for competition, is 
considering an intervention in the battle between EDF, the French electricity 
monopoly, and the Italian government. The latter has passed an ad hoc law 
restricting EDF to 2 percent of the voting rights for Montedison, the Italian 
electricity supplier spun off by Enel.  

Analysis: Once again, the issue of reciprocity has taken center stage in the 
European power market, with EDF playing the staring role. For the last year 
or so, as the European Union (EU) has enacted electric competition across the 
Continent, France's EDF has taken advantage of competitive opportunities in 
other European countries while resisting any penetration of its own market by 
foreign suppliers. Although EDF has a presence in the United Kingdom through 
its ownership of London Electricity, the French power firm has wanted for 
some time to increase its position in Spain and Italy. However, the 
neighboring governments continue to fight any expansion by EDF until France 
reciprocates and allows further liberalization of its own market. 

As I have mentioned before in this column, France has been criticized by 
other European nations for delaying energy liberalization in its own country. 
As a result, EDF (which controls approximately 90 percent of the French 
electric industry) may not be allowed to make additional acquisitions abroad 
until it further opens its own market to competition. To date, France has 
only opened its power and gas markets by the minimum amount imposed by the 
EU, and EDF has played a large role in this resistance. While other European 
countries such as Germany have opened 100 percent of their markets to 
competition, France has opted for a phased-in approach, opening a third each 
of its power and gas markets by February 2003 and August 2008, respectively. 
Thus, although other companies such as Spain's Endesa have attempted to push 
through barriers to obtain entry into France, it is questionable when true 
competition will emerge in the country.  

Nevertheless, EDF has now set its sights on Italy through an expansion of its 
holdings in Montedison, one of Italy's main electricity companies. Reports 
are mixed about how much EDF currently owns of Montedison. EDF recently said 
that its stake increased from 3.971 percent to 5.971 percent. However, other 
reports have indicated that EDF already controls about 20 percent of the 
capital assets of Montedison. Both increases in Montedison were made 
recently, which EDF was forced to confirm to the Italian stock market 
regulatory Consob. EDF has claimed that its holdings in Montedison were made 
strictly as a minority financial holding to diversify the company's financial 
assets across Europe. However, at the same time, EDF has also indicated that 
any increase it makes in its holdings on Montedison would be for trading 
purposes. In other words, EDF wants to control the generating assets of 
Montedison for resale across Europe's wholesale market. Further, with a 
20-percent stake, EDF would become Montedison's largest shareholder and a 
major presence in Italy's power market even as France remains mostly closed.  

EDF's argument that it has secured a stake in Montedison solely for financial 
diversification purposes is not flying with the European Union or the Italian 
government. The consensus across the Continent is that EDF is making a 
strategic increase of its electric holdings and plans to make as many 
additional acquisitions as will be allowed by EU regulators. In fact, EDF has 
admitted that its strategy is to ""make 50 percent of its turnover from 
activities abroad by the end of 2005, compared with 25 percent currently."" 
Consequently, it is clear that the French power firm is looking beyond its 
home country for expansion opportunities, and these opportunities typically 
have been in distribution and generation assets. Moving forward, the company 
has expressed an interest in expanding its trading operation 

For instance, last month I discussed a report that EDF is preparing a bid for 
the regional U.K. electricity company Seeboard, which is owned by American 
Electric Power (NYSE: AEP). Serving about two million connected customers in 
England, Seeboard owns, operates and maintains an electricity network of over 
45,000 km (28,000 miles) of overhead lines and underground cables. An 
acquisition of Seeboard would factor into EDF's overall expansion efforts in 
Europe and be a nice complement to London Electricity, one of 12 regional 
electricity companies in England and Wales, which EDF bought from Entergy in 
1998. In addition, EDF has also made acquisitions in Sweden (Graninge) and 
Germany (EnBW) and reportedly is Poland's largest electricity distributor. 
These acquisitions were made by EDF International, which is wholly owned by 
the French government, and thus subject to EU oversight. Perhaps due to EDF's 
size and presence in Europe, these previous acquisitions were allowed without 
a great deal of EU intervention. However, now that other countries have 
voiced criticism of EDF and put pressure on the EU to intercede, it is 
unlikely that further acquisitions will proceed without intense scrutiny.  

As noted, trading appears to be the next wave of EDF's expansion efforts. 
Toward this end, EDF partnered with Louis Dreyfus in 1999 to create an energy 
trading company called EDF Trading. The various companies that EDF has 
invested in across Europe support the company's efforts to both learn about 
new competitive techniques and financially benefit when competition opens 
fully across the Continent.  

For its part, the Italian government has responded that it will block any 
increase of EDF's ownership of Montedison, based primarily on the argument 
that EDF is not offering the same opportunity for expansion in France. 
Specifically, Italy is working on a decree that would freeze the voting 
rights attached to the shares that EDF holds in Montedison. Further outlining 
its position, the Italian government has said that Italy must protect the 
imminent privatization of the power stations in the country that will soon be 
sold by Enel, one of the country's main power firms. As Montedison will be 
one of the main contenders of the assets owned by Enel, the Italian 
government wants to block EDF from increasing its share in the company and 
thus having access to additional power assets in Italy. For instance, Enel is 
planning to sell Elettrogen, a generation company that produces about 15 
percent of the production capacity in Italy. If EDF were to increase its 
stake in Montedison before or after Montedison makes a play for Elettrogen, 
then EDF, as a foreign entity, would gain a lock over the Italian power 
supply market.  

Italy's anti-EDF law is an interesting development, but it does not mark the 
first such legislation that has been initiated across the Continent. Spain 
also has created a similar law that is specifically targeted against EDF with 
regard to the French company's pursuit of Hidrocantabrico, Spain's fourth 
largest supplier. However, despite the efforts by Spain and Italy to restrict 
any expansion of EDF, the laws, although they are already in place, may 
ultimately be deemed anti-competitive and a breach of the Treaty of Rome, 
which calls for unlimited freedom on the movement of capital within the EU. 
Similar to how the Federal Trade Commission investigates anti-trust 
allegations in the United States, any attempt to overturn the laws in Spain 
and Italy would result in lengthy legal battles. 

EDF also remains interested in the Spanish's largest power utility Endesa, 
which is about the only foreign company that has been able to penetrate the 
French electricity market (through a 30-percent acquisition of French 
electricity generator Soci&eacutet,Nationale d&#39Electricit,et de 
Thermique). Endesa, which recently terminated an attempted merger with 
Iberdrola, Spain's second largest power firm, has been viewed as a takeover 
target for larger companies such as EDF. 

At last report, the EU Commission said that it would base any decision to 
intervene in the battle between EDF and the Italian government on ""how far 
control was being exercised."" In other words, EU intervention will be based 
on how much foreign control EDF might wield in the Italian market with an 
increased stake in Montedison. The fact that France remains resistant to 
electric competition in its own country remains a key factor in this debate, 
and it certainly adds heat to the criticisms leveled against EDF by the 
governments of Italy and Spain.

Understanding (MOU) related to the sale of its transmission assets with 
members of the investment community.  After a  brief description of major 
provisions of the MOU, questions were taken.  Following is a summary of that 
call.

Major Components of Plan (repeatedly referred to as the ""Governor's Plan"")

Maintains cost-of-service treatment for utility retained generation for 10 
years
Sale of transmission assets (or other assets) to CDWR
Dedication of the ""Sunrise"" generation project to cost-of-service based rates 
for 10 years ($2 mm penalty if not on-line by August)
Provision of easements and potential conveyances in fee of certain lands (at 
two hydro projects)
Provides for full recovery of $3.5 B utility net underrecovery as of 1/31/01
Commits SCE to spend $3 B in capital expenditures over 5 years
Dismissal of federal lawsuits by SCE
SCE will resume traditional utility procurement obligations by 1/1/03, 
assuming CDWR contracts and entering into new purchase contracts as necessary

It was stressed that the MOU was a comprehensive plan to be treated as an 
integrated package.  While the CPUC and members of the legislature were 
involved in various stages of the negotiation, the agreement is technically 
between SCE and CDWR.  Various regulatory and legislative approvals are 
necessary for implementation of the MOU.  SCE has rights to terminate the MOU 
if the CPUC  has not adopted specified ""implementing decisions"" within 60 
days.  Legislation necessary to implement certain provisions of the MOU must 
be passed by August 15.

For ratemaking purposes the CPUC will grant SCE a 11.6% ROE on its generation 
and distribution rate base.

Questions and Answers

What was expected timing of return to investment grade for SCE?
Up to the rating agencies.  Many steps to go through.  It is assumed agencies 
will be following closely but timing is uncertain.  Would have to be before 
utility resumes power procurement obligations.

Applicability of 11.6% ROE?
ROE would increase from current 7% ROE to level no less than 11.6% for both 
generation and distribution assets on unamortized balance at 12/31/00 and 
capital structure roughly at 50/50.

Potential for write-offs?
While plan calls for full recovery of net undercollections as of 1/31/01, 
because of timing issues SCE may take a write-off then have a ""write-up"" at a 
later date.

Interest in how/why/impact of inclusion of Mission Sunrise generation project 
(investor concern over market v. regulated returns)?
The state was looking at all options for long-term power contracts.  Market 
returns traded for security of long-term contract.

What will be source for $3 b capital investments over next 5 years?
Capital would come from retained earnings, borrowing and additional 
investments from holding company.

Concern over ability of existing rate level (and ""waterfall"" disbursement) to 
recover all costs especially if CDWR procurement costs increase?
 Existing rates should cover all costs.  Provisions in MOU allow adjustment 
to rates to maintain investment grade status.

What was gained from MOU as opposed to pursuit through the courts?
Speed and certainty with respect to resolution of outstanding issues. 

Will the sale be a taxable event?
Yes.

What is the URG unit cost?
$.042 per kwH.

In 2003 would SCE have ability to replace contracts of CDWR (when SCE resumes 
procurement role)?
SCE would have ability to enter into new contracts, but would not ignore 
obligations under CDWR contracts.  New contracts would be subject to PUC 
prudence review.  SCE would file procurement plan with the PUC.

On the agenda for the next week are two important items - (1) the Mayor's 
February 1 news conference announcing the Houston Fire Chief selection 
committee and its members; and (2) coordination of an action plan, which we 
should work out prior to the news conference.

News Conference specifics:
speakers - Mayor Brown and Jeff Skilling
in attendance - all selection committee members
location - Fire Station #6, 3402 Washington Ave.
date - Thursday, February 1, 2001
time - 2pm
duration - approximately 30 minutes

I'd like to emphasize that it would be ideal if all selection committee 
members were present at the news conference. 

I will need bios on each committee member emailed to me by close of business 
Monday, January 29, 2001. These bios will be attached to a press release the

3203,"January 1, 2000

Earlier, with some trepidation, I turned on my laptop, opened up Word
(Microsoft's word processing program) and, once there, my journal.  I typed
in ""January"".  Before I could go on, however, Mr. Gates' program proudly
displayed the fact it knew where I was going, anticipating a date.  The
program guessed the date would be ""January 1, 2000"".  It was right.  I
smiled to myself at what seemed, at the moment, a bit of bravado.  I was
also pleased that I had apparently been left unbitten by the dreaded Y2K
bug, as had (I understood from the news reports) most of the rest of the
world.

I am happily settling down to a quiet Saturday night alone, after a
(slightly) booze-soaked Friday night of saying a great big ""hey"" to the new
millenium.  Last night my girlfriend Sukran and I had gone to my friend
Ismail's, joining his family and a dozen or so of his friends.  We drank
wine and raki (the Turkish version of the anise-based liquor that is
reported to have helped kill, among others, Turkey's founding father Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk).  We listened to and sang (here, I have to admit, I was still
mostly listening) Turkish songs, as well as a few by Bob Dylan (with me
privately concluding that ""Blowing in the Wind"", after hearing it again
after so many years, was the song of the century).

Closer to midnight we turned on the television, watched the view from the
air of Istanbul's magnificent Blue Mosque, set ablaze by its powerful
floodlights.  A smallish crowd, reported to be about 1,000, would later
watch a modest fireworks display there.  The TV switched to another aerial
view, this time of Istanbul's Taksim Square.  Though the square can fairly
described as Istanbul's Times Square, the crowd there, which I later learned
was overwhelmingly male, could not have numbered more than a few tens of
thousands.  At midnight the TV was shut off and we gathered around Ismail's
seventh floor windows.  From there we watched his neighbors, apparently
observing an age-old New Year's tradition in his neighborhood (Kurtulus),
dropped empty bottles from their windows into the street below.  The roof of
a Mercedes was dented.  Taxies wove their way between exploded bottles,
which on the pavement below -- from my somewhat alcohol-laced, seven-story
high perspective -- looked like giant snowflakes.  People hung from windows
along both sides of the street, some waving sparklers and shouting.  Passing
cars, ignoring the threat from above, tooted their horns merrily.  In the
distance was the sound of fireworks coming from Taksim and the sky, already
hazy from the ubiquitous smog, became spotted with clouds of drifting
gunpowder smoke.

As the night went on (and delightfully on) I learned that every one of the
couples at Ismail's, including Sukran and me, had had a serious fight
earlier in what was now the previous day.  I was surprised by this and
wondered (without reaching any conclusions) what it might have been about
the day that triggered such behavior.  Yet despite the troubling things
inspired by the final few moments of the last particularly wonderful and
terrible century, all were forgotten in the first few moments of the next
(and still undescribable) one -- replaced for the time being by smiles,
songs and much laughter.

And indeed it appears the night passed in a similarly positive fashion
worldwide.  Threats here in Turkey of attacks on millenium celebrations by
Islamic radicals -- apparently offended by both the booze and the brouhaha
over the passing of a date on the Christian calendar -- proved empty (or
perhaps frustrated by the conspicuous number of police).  Nothing else of
that kind, or of any other kind of awfulness, appeared to have occurred
anywhere in the world.  Even the Y2K bug seems to have been born without a
stinger.  What a nice way to start the new year/decade/century/millenium.

3205,"I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr & Ken Brooks (immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of ""vacation freezes"". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee. It states in that policy the following:
""An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible.""
""The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee's vacation request.""
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this matter.

Thanks again fro your thoughtful notes.

Can't say life normal, but in areas without damage not to far away from it.
Plenty of food.  No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normal
loads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxed
by the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the suffering
will be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lot
of suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solid
ground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spent
two of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.
Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and have
been able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, every
open space not too close to a building seems to be filled with people
sleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between things
trees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets made
relatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me how
kind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of one
poor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindely
misplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And what
you read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard by
Russian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.  Wish Turkey
all the luck in the world.  It will need it.

Able to watch the local news, though obviously don't understand a lot of
what they're saying.  Still, the pictures tell enough.

You might be interested in knowing that a version of the previous was
published in the English language Turkish Daily News here on February 9th.
(I'm still waiting to hear back from some folks in the States.)  Afraid that
it might appear a bit negative about the Turks, I shortened it, taking out
for example my speculation about how Turkish soldiers might treat folks who
outflanked the fence as well as some of my thoughts about why all the
windows had been knocked out.  (I did leave in my thought about
""vindictiveness"" being the justification.)   It still got edited a bit, for
example my use of the word ""invasion"" was changed to ""Peace Operation"",
which is the somewhat euphemistic term it is known by here (which doesn't
not mean I am saying the Turks weren't justified in invading the place).

I'd love to hear your thoughts about it, or any other news that you all
might have.

Hope all goes well.

Mark

3223,"Dear Jeff,

Hope you are doing well.  It has been quite a long time since we last spoke
when I was with Pathnet.  I have since started another company called Cogent
Communications and the company has been progressing very well in the last
year.

I'm in the process of putting together an Advisory Committee for the company
composed of industry, business, and political leaders.  I think your depth
of experience in telecom could add a lot of value to the company and am
looking to gauge your interest level in joining the committee.  The
commitment is limited to one meeting per year and you would receive stock in
the company.  Thus far we have commitments from Sergio Zyman of Coca Cola
and are in discussions with Bob Dole and Vernon Jordan.

Cogent is a facilities-based ISP offering very high bandwidth Internet
access to business users in the top tier cities in the US.  Utilizing the
latest in fiber-optic technology, we've built an all optical nationwide
network and are offering 100mbps non-oversubscribed service for a flat rate
of $1,000 per month.  Feel free to take a look at our website at
www.cogentco.com.  The company has raised over $350MM in financing to date
with investors including Oak Investment Partners, Broadview Capital, Texas
Pacific Group, Capital Research, and Worldview Technology Partners.

Please give me a call/email at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to
speaking with you and catching up.

Sincerely,

Dave Schaeffer, CEO

3228,"Phillip,

I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.  
Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price 
curve to calculate the mark to market.  Then that day's transactions can be 
entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous 
positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.  Initially, I 
thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L 
whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of 
the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time 
value and storage costs would be included).  However, this only works if the 
person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which 
require marking.  As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, 
I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits 
on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.  

The main question I have is simply, ""Should I be calculating the P&L for each 
person's storage book for open and closed positions?""  Then beyond that, if 
we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage 
is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the 
ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.  So, I guess I could 
apply the model for that purpose.  Does this make sense to you?  Any comments 
are appreciated.  Thanks.

3232,"We are launching a number of committees to perform key functions across Enron.  Enron's breadth of activities and nonhierarchal organization make it increasingly necessary to broaden the participation of Enron's next generation of leadership in the important decisions affecting the company.  Broadening participation will result in increased access to information as decisions are made and will allow committee members to extend their working relationships and influence throughout the company.

The committee charters and memberships are set forth below.  Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance.  We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair.

VP PRC

The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director.

Analyst/Associate Program

The most essential determinant of Enron's continued growth is our ability to attract and develop new talent.  The analyst/associate program has been the biggest contributor to our success in this area.  Charlene Jackson, currently leading our analyst/associate program, has taken a commercial position in EES' account management organization.  We thank Charlene for her hard work and many contributions to the program.  Going forward, this program will be administered by a committee chaired by John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe.  The members of this committee are listed below.  Billy Lemmons, currently Vice President of Enron Global Markets, will lead the day-to-day operations of the program.

3280,"Hi Rhonda -

I was told you're the person to contact regarding changes in the Enpower 
counterparty list. Several items are outdated or have gone through many 
different versions, and it's made somewhat of a confusing situation for the 
traders and others who do deal entry. My sensitivity to this is heightened 
because I'm new to the Deal Control position here at the Portland West Desk, 
and I'm still getting used to which names we use and which we don't. Monica 
Lande suggested I ask you about it, although she pointed out that if we've 
ever booked a deal under any of these counterparty names, then they need to 
stay in the system. 

I'm wondering if there is any way to weed out some of those extra selections. 
For example, Duke and El Paso both have five different names in the system; 
Arizona Public Service Company has become Pinnacle; and other names were just 
tests that are no longer used. 

Please let me know whenever you have a free moment - this is certainly not an 
urgent request, and I completely understand if the list needs to stay as is. 
Just checking.

3312,"Thanks for your call Friday and sorry I wasn't available.

You asked for our analysis concerning the fact that the website will include 
price data (initially on the full list of 200 or so Reference Entities) which 
will be generally available to be seen, but not traded on by parties 
accessing our credit website.

You're quite right that, prima facie, although trading on these names will 
not be possible in all countries from which the credit website may be 
accessed, the concerns discussed relating to confidential info are still 
pertinent.  Ultimately, we have managed to get reasonably comfortable with 
these issues (along with outside counsel), based on the following mitigants:

a special disclaimer (legal and privacy statement) blessed by US and UK 
counsel will appear on the website (this emphasises ""no reliance"" by parties 
visiting the website)
the due diligence for the 8 countries we reviewed - since they include Common 
Law and Civil law jurisdictions (particularly the US and UK) - should have 
flushed out the main issues likely to arise in other countries
provided we adhere to our new procedures governing confidential information, 
these should be effective to prevent similar claims which might arise under 
the laws of most other countries
as a general point, it is impossible to do legal due diligence in all 
countries having internet access and many legal commentators take the view 
that a pragmatic stance can be taken in the context of internet marketing 
provided the markets where due diligence has not been performed are not being 
specifically targeted for business.

Timing - The Wesite will launch this Wednesday as planned, but it now appears 
(as I think you know) that the Online team in Houston are requiring up to 2 
clear weeks to set up the new product. This means that crdit trading on Enron 
Online will launch on or before 8 March.

I hope this helps and look forward to speaking to you tomorrow.

3324,"I think this is the most recent version of the ETA.  Obviously, this is the 
UK version and Sullivan & Cromwell are turning it into a US document.  The US 
version will be governed by NY law and contain an arbitration clause.  We're 
also trying to figure out how much to say about the confirmation process 
since it may vary from product to product and will almost certainly be 
different from the UK version.  Speaking of which, I was surprised to find 
that they have the telephone conversation (and in this case the web site 
records) control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties.  
What's the practice in your part of the world?  One alternative is to insert 
the language (or something like it) that we use in financial trading which 
says that we will send a written confirm, gives the counterparty a short time 
(2 or 3 days) to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed 
acceptance.  Would that work for your deals?

Anyway, I'm in NY today and tomorrow, back in the office on Wed.  Louise is 
insistent that the GTC's be available to be uploaded this weekend.  I'll be

On insurance I have faxed across our legal opinion on weather. We prepared a

there is no  nexus between damage/loss suffered by a party and payments under 
the weather derivative.

Laura Unger that summarizes the findings from a series of on-line investing 
roundtables conducted earlier this year on on-line brokerage.  The report 
makes recommendations for ongoing dialogue between regulators and industry 
and for regulatory strategies she believes the Commission should consider.  

The findings and recommendations in the report focus on the issues of 
suitability, best execution, market data, systems
capacity, investor education, on-line discussion forums, privacy, and 
portals.  Commissioner Unger believes these are
among the key on-line issues facing investors and the industry today.

Unger said,"" The Internet is rapidly making on-line trading ubiquitous.  This 
report provides the Commission with a 
comprehensive examination of the critical issues to be addressed in the area 
of technology.  I think it may still be premature
for extensive rulemaking in this area, but the report will allow the

I have reviewed the language your counsel sent and have discussed it with o=
ur General Counsel.  We can agree to remove the loss of bargain concept but=
 not the other two damage concepts.  We do not agree to the removal of ""cos=
t of funding"" since this can be a very real issue when a replacement transa=
ction requires a premium to be paid because of the off-market position.  Pr=
emiums for such positions will have a cost of funding component.  The remov=
al of the concept of ""loss or cost incurred as a result of terminating, liq=
uidating, or obtaining or reestablishing a hedge or trading position"" is al=
so a very real factor in calculating damages.  It may very well be that the=
 termination of a hedge is the more cost effective alternative to replacing=
 the transaction.  Furthermore, the you can obtain the same effect of termi=
nating a hedge by entering into an offsetting transaction (the equivalent o=
f a replacement transaction) rather than an outright termination with the h=
edge counterparty. Because the termination of a hedge is the other side of =
the coin, so to speak, it makes sense to leave it in the definition of Loss=
.  We can clarify that such losses and costs are without duplication, which=
 I think was one of your outside counsels concerns.  The definition of Loss=
 as was written is designed so that the Non-defaulting party can recover th=
e actual damages occasioned by the Defaulting Party's failure to perform.  =
If the Defaulting Party objects to the Non-defaulting Party's calculation t=
hen such calculation would be subject to negotiation or litigation and fina=
l determination by a New York court. =20

We would propose modifying your changes to read as follows:=20

Insert the following into Part 1(e), after the period at the end thereof. =
=20

""The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as fo=
llows:=20

""Loss"" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Tran=
sactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equival=
ent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a co=
mmercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs (or gain, in which =

th this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Tra=
nsactions, as the case may be, including any cost of funding or, at the ele=
ction of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a res=
ult of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge =
or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them).   to =
be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a re=
placement transaction.  Loss does not include any loss of bargain, cost of =

ng, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions.  Fu=
rthermore, Loss does not include loss of bargain, or  a party's legal fees =
and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11.  A party will dete=
rmine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is no=
t reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonab=
ly practicable.  A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference=
 to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers=
 in the relevant market.""


 If the concept of a Replacement Value is preferable to you we are also wil=
ling to use the following definition, which was originally drafted by Goldm=
an Sachs, in lieu of the Loss definition.
 =20
""Replacement Value"" , means, with respect to each Terminated Transaction or=
 group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, an amou=
nt that the party (the ""Determining Party"") or its agent determines in good=
 faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to be its total losses and c=
osts (or gains, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection=
 with that Terminated Transaction or group of terminated Transactions.  A D=
etermining Party (or its agent) may determine Replacement Values for all Te=
rminated Transactions, any group of Terminated Transactions or individual T=
erminated Transactions, and may apply different valuation methods to differ=
ent Transactions or groups of Transactions.   A Determining Party (or its a=
gent) will determine Replacement Values for all Terminated Transactions as =
of the Early Termination Date, or, if that would not be commercially reason=
able, as of the latest date or dates before or the earliest date or dates a=
fter the Early Termination Date as would be commercially reasonable under t=

Enron Trading Services Inc (""ETSI"") can act as agent for ENA in arranging 
transactions with North American Metals customers, so as to take advantage of 
the ENA ISDAs with the respective customers.

ENA will need to pay compensation to ETSI for its services as agent, and a 
services agreement will therefore need to be put in place.

ENA will then need to enter into a back to back transaction with Enron Metals 
Limited. The back to back transaction will need to 
1. transfer the economic metals postion to Enron Metals Limited; and
2. recover the cost of the service fee paid to ETSI; and
3. leave a margin to cover the credit risk assumed by ENA (this margin needs 
to be at market rates). If no credit spread is to be left in ENA, the back to 
back contract will need to be written such that all credit risk is passed 
through to Enron Metals Limited (ie ENA does not pay Enron Metals Limited 
unless ENA is paid by the customer).

He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee.  I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies.  

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.

 The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are 
willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require that 
we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we 
are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction 
Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a 
response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our 
response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download 
of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hear 
from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in 
the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as 
attached.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages
Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the
right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the
maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or
industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in
their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those
industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ
significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the
boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please
over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before
customer contact.

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption
or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in
ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be
managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical
that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal,
Hamilton-Sundstrom

If they expect me to continue to sell products involving service from their desk, and they get paid for that service, they are going to have to do a better job.

An EFO is a result of parties not complying with an OFO after multiple noti=

The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO.  EFO stands for Emergency flow or=

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Doug Hammer, an Enron Northern Natural Gas senior operations and maintenance technician located at the LNG facility in Wrenshall, Minnesota, died earlier this week.  Doug gave many years of dedicated service to EOTT and most recently Northern Natural Gas.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Doug's family.
 
Recognizing this is a difficult time for us all, the Enron Employee Assistance Program is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Please call 713.853.6057, or 1.800.345.1391 for assistance.

Red Rock - System Ops and Planning have determined that if Red Rock capacity is staged in, Sta. 1/2 in-service 6/1 and Sta. 3 late, the capacity available is 70,000/d which indicates we would have to allocate into the contracted amount that should begin 6/1.  Should we think about setting aside the 1,700/d for Oneok's contract so they don't get allocated?
