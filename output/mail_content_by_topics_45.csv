GRAB A SEAT, AND JOIN ME FOR MY DINNER WITH BILL GATES

    On the eve of Windows XP's launch, I joined
         14 other journalists for a private dinner
         with the chairman and chief software architect
         of Microsoft.  We had one thing in common: When
         Bill talks, we write about it. And on this night
         he was talking, and just to us. Here's part
         one of what Bill had to say.

  SERIOUS ABOUT SECURITY? BETTER DOUBLE YOUR OPTIONS

   Think user IDs and passwords are adequate?
         Think again. Those single-factor security

         more secure. David looks at the promise--and

If you are referring to the Wireless call, I was on the call and actively 
participated with Peter G.  I had the agenda discussion items and  guided the 
conversation. The call was brief and enabled HP and Peter G. to discuss 
wireless initiatives briefly. Then Peter G. literally read from my notes the 
""message"" you gave him about the need for HP to support the process on both 
the buy and sell sides.  

The call went well, message was delivered and Darrin will follow up with HP 
so they can come in to Enron and present the wireless intiative.

Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy (but not Gerry Cashiola) were on the call.  Greg 
Pyle made a note of saying that HP realized that they were going to have to 
fully support the process on both the buy and sell sides.

I will still connect back with Greg Pyle by phone.

After the Universal-Enron conference call with Elyse Kalmans and Misha

The majority of the JPI is for-profit and therefore Community Relations 
cannot be a sponsoring party.
Elyse recommended I contact Mark Palmer to discuss the sponsorship and the 
value tied to EMS, Weather, Plastics & Credit.
Universal was hesitant to comment on dollar amounts for the sponsorship but 
noted $250K would be the lowest amount for the JPI Virtual Institute. 

I wanted to consult your advice as to what tactics would be best at this 
point.  Is Mark Palmer definitely the correct contact?  Would you prefer to 
contact him on this front?

way behind on everything.
#1. 3 years
#2.  volume way down on exchange recently with recent volatility.  volume 
probably averaging 25000 these days.  EOL volume averaging around 14000.   
Very high percent of market.   Current market conditions shows why our 
transactional model of being one side of every trade is superior.  
#3.  good liquidity first 3 years.  okay liquidity years 4-6.
#4.  calendar 2004-2008 maybe 1 trade a day.  70% chance Enron is one side.

News Brief

+High Cost of Oil and Natural Gas Puts FPL $518 Million Behind in Fuel
Expense Recovery

Faced with skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices and heavy seasonal demand
for electricity, Florida Power & Light Company has filed preliminary
paperwork with the Florida Public Service Commission identifying $518
million in expenses above projections for fuel burned to produce electricity
in 2000. FPL will file with the Commission in September for permission to
recover the expense in customer bills beginning Jan. 1, 2001.

Part of this increase will be offset by a refund to customers that is
currently estimated to be $75 million to $100 million. The refund is
pursuant to an agreement reached in April 1999 with the Office of the Public
Counsel and the FPSC that provides for revenue sharing between FPL and its
customers, as well as a 6% annual rate reduction for three years. As a
result of the forecasted fuel costs and the expected rebate, residential
electric rates could increase by approximately 13% per kilowatt-hour.

The cost of oil used to generate electricity has more than doubled since the
first quarter of 1999 and has not been this high since the Gulf War in 1990.
Since January 2000, oil prices have increased 44% per barrel. Natural gas
prices also have risen unabated, climbing 77% since January 2000. With the
onset of winter, natural gas prices may increase further as demand for
heating fuel increases.

 WAKE UP AMER  A, THIS IS WHY OUR
 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND
 AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION

Where We're Headed
    By Robert A. Waters
****************************************************************

 You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your
 bedroom door.

 Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled
 whispers. At least two people have broken into your house
 and are moving your way.

 With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed
 and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the
 chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.

 In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a
 weapon--it looks like a crowbar.

 When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the
 shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor.
 One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to
 the front door and lurches outside.

 As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're
 in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years
 before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently
 regulated as to make them useless.
 Yours was never registered.

 Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.
 They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal
 Possession of a Firearm.

 When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry:
 authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter.
 ""What kind of sentence will I get?"" you ask.
 ""Only ten-to-twelve years,"" he replies, as if that's nothing.
 ""Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven.""

 The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local
 newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric
 vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir
 boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say
 about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities
 acknowledge that both ""victims"" have been arrested numerous
 times. But the next day's headline says it all:
 ""Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die."" The thieves have
 been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type
 pranksters.

 As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media
 picks it up, then the international media.

 The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney
 says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.

 The media publishes reports that your home has been
 burglarized several times in the past and that you've been
 critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the
 suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you
 would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to
 allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.

 A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been
 reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When
 you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works
 against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean,
 vengeful man.

 It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.

 The judge sentences you to life in prison.

__________________________________________

 This case really happened.

***********************************
 On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England,
 killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was
 convicted and is now serving a life term.

 How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the
 once-great British Empire?

 It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly
 reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and
 established that handgun sales were to be made only to those
 who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing
 to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.
 Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of
 any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of
 all shotguns.

 Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after
 the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a
 mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down
 the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared,
 17 people were dead.

 The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of ""gun
 control"", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all
 privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan
 used a rifle.)

 Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used
 a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at
 a public school.

 For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as
 mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real
 kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day,
 week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and
 demanded a total ban on all handguns.
 The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the
 few sidearms still owned by private citizens.

 During the years in which the British government incrementally
 took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right
 to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities
 refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened,
 claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to
 own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were
 charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the
 Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, ""We
 cannot have people take the law into their own hands.""

 All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and
 several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young
 thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a
 collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or
 stolen by burglars.

 When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns
 were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.
 Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few
 who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year
 prison sentences if they didn't comply.

 Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns
 from private citizens.

 How did the authorities know who had handguns?

 The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars.

 Sound familiar?

73,"Accomplishments:
Conducted several workshops with EECC and the CALME region this week
Scheduled workshops with NEPCO
Have identified the needs to be addressed in the NEPCO workshops and are 
arranging appropriate resources
Met with the London COE to discuss their status in terms of reporting (we are 
sharing data from workshops)
Have made an initial offer to Corp HR cost center users to conduct workshops 
for them
Brought in some EY help to work with the business units to understand the 
multiple environments, extraction and analysis tools being used by the 
different business units

Upcoming:
Additional workshops for EECC and ESA
Identification of the Corp groups that would like to have these sessions made 
available (and subjects they would like to cover)
Will complete the ""user"" guides with screen prints to give out to all 
participants (step by step instructions, tools, and tips)
Finalize the NEPCO workshops (Mar 20-22)
Produce a plan for upcoming workshops for ECCS and Design review


Summary analysis of evaluations from this week's workshops:
Our overall belief is that the workshops, the one on one attention, the new 
content etc. are being received very well (scores averages around 3.5 on a 
scale of 1-4)
The score for the question of whether SAP will meet the reporting needs is 
still too low (average of 2.8).  We will continue to analyze the root cause 
of this problem.  
There is definitely an improvement in people understanding which modules 
contain which data.  We believe that a hand-out we developed really helped 
this and will continue to continue to emphasize this learning.

Comments received:
Very good and useful
Could have used this sooner
Sessions are not long enough
I love the workshop idea, its so much better than training classes

Feel free to contact me, Melissa or Kim with any questions or concerns.

Thanks for the note - coming from JPMorgan I understand the importance of VAR 
as a key control measure and I appreciate that we may all need to do further 
work to 'institutionalise' a VAR culture in Enron. However, in this instance, 
I believe the initial comment has been taken out of context.

I believe there is a general communication issue here. Since inception the 
business has been monitoring risk via the use of a cumulative sensitivity 
measure for the portfolio - expressed and reported as DV01on the daily DPR. 
However, no-one in RAC/Commercial/Commercial Support appears to have formally 
equated that sensitivity to the business VAR limit during the longer than 
expected delay to the completion of a signed off VAR model. ( informally this 
is being done )

I would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly 
necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit 
spread movements in the market and for RAC to have signed off this scaling 
factor. Bryan Seyfield and David Wall will propose this immediately.

Finally, I believe both Commercial and Commercial Support for Credit Trading 
are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for VAR reporting  
- we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible.

I look forward to discussing this and other RAC/Commercial Support interface 
issues with you next week

Regards

Mike

79,"In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of 
people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that 
team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that 
perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic 
has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team 
and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy 
Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through 
CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the 
facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in 
conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior 
Director
 CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

 User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power 
Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

 NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
 ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, 
were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked 
in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles 
where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing 
both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the 
operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the 
past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project 
managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations 
experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most 
appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie 
on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very 
quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a 
scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over 
natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since 
Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was 
already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the 
project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to 
EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, 
who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom 
looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently 
renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange 
project team, and we transfered her along with the project to 
CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements 
work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is 
input from my group that has created the modules by defining user 
requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  
I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's 
participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a 
senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development 
background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was 
the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on 
CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her 
involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to 
CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is 
excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable 
operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie 
Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from 
day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging 
products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and 
both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and 
back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their 
replacements on CommodityLogic.

                           Learn the ins and outs of filing after mid-April 
deadline 

                           By GARY KLOTT 
                           Tribune Media 

                           For the many millions of individuals who have yet 
to file their 2000 income tax returns, there is no
                           reason to panic. 

                           If you need more time to file your return, you can 
easily get a filing extension. 

                           And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now, 
you can buy more time to pay up. While you may be
                           subject to interest and penalties for payments 
made after April 16, you can put off the day of
                           reckoning for months without fear that IRS 
collection agents will come after you. There is even a
                           loophole in the law that will enable many 
individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being
                           assessed interest or penalties. 

                           Nevertheless, April 16 is a critical deadline for 
anyone who has yet to file his tax returns. You'll need
                           to file either your tax return or an extension 
request by the deadline. And to avoid interest and
                           penalties, you'll generally need to pay any taxes 
owed by April 16. 

                           April 16 is also the deadline for making IRA 
contributions for 2000 returns and for making the first
                           installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 2001. 

                           Filing extension: If you'd like more time to file 
your return, getting a filing extension is simple. In fact,
                           the IRS has expanded the options this year for 
obtaining a filing extension. You can now do it by
                           phone, computer or mail. 

                           The traditional way to get an extension is to fill 
out IRS Form 4868, ""Application for Automatic
                           Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income 
Tax Return"" and mail it to the IRS by the April 16
                           deadline. If you're using tax-preparation software 
or a tax professional, you can file your extension
                           request by computer. Or you can phone in your 
extension request by calling 888-796-1074. 

                           If you owe the IRS money, another option for 
requesting an extension is to make the payment by
                           credit card (American Express, Discover or 
MasterCard) on the Internet or by phone through one
                           of the two companies the IRS has authorized for 
processing credit card payments. Details on the
                           option are included in the Form 4868 instructions. 

                           By making the extension request, the IRS will 
automatically give you four more months, until Aug.
                           15, to file your return. 

                           You can get an extension for any reason. No 
explanation is asked for when requesting an extension. 

                           But be aware that your extension request only 
gives you extra time to file your return, not to pay
                           your taxes. To avoid interest and possible penalty 
charges, you must estimate how much you owe
                           and make the payment with your extension request 
by the April 16 deadline. 

                           Unable to pay: If you can't afford to pay your tax 
bill, you should at least file an extension request by
                           the April 16 deadline. 

                           Though you'll be subject to interest and possible 
penalty charges for late payment of your taxes,
                           you'll avoid being hit with a late-filing penalty, 
which runs a steep five percent a month (up to a
                           maximum 25 percent.) 

                           Installment plan: If you still don't have the cash 
to pay your taxes by the time your extension runs out
                           on Aug. 15, you can negotiate with the IRS to pay 
your balance due in monthly installments. You
                           make the request for an installment agreement when 
you file your completed tax return using Form
                           9465, ""Installment Agreement Request."" 

                           ""Offer in compromise"": If you can't afford to pay 
all you owe in taxes, even in installments over a
                           period of years, you may be able to work out a 
settlement with the IRS. The IRS recently expanded
                           its ""Offer in Compromise"" program, in which 
taxpayers in tough financial situations can offer to settle
                           for less than they owe. Offers are submitted using 
IRS Form 656, ""Offer in Compromise."" 

                           A loophole offers an extra month to pay up: If all 
you need is an extra month or so to come up with
                           the cash to pay your tax bill, there is a way you 
may be able to get a short reprieve without being
                           subject to interest or penalties. 

                           All you need do is take the IRS up on its offer to 
calculate your tax bill for you. 

                           If you're eligible for the offer, fill out your 
tax return, stopping short of computing certain totals, and
                           send it in by April 16. The IRS will compute your 
tax and send you a bill for any tax owed. If you
                           pay within 30 days of the notice, you won't be 
assessed any penalties or interest. 

                           To take advantage of the loophole, your taxable 
income must be less than $100,000 and you can't
                           itemize deductions. The full list of eligibility 
requirements and step-by-step instructions are contained
                           in IRS Publication 967, ""The IRS Will Figure Your 
Tax."" 

                           Retirement account contributions: If you hope to 
contribute to an Individual Retirement Account, the
                           final deadline for 2000 tax-year contributions is 
April 16, even if you obtain a filing extension. 

                           The deadline is more flexible for self-employed 
retirement plans. Contributions to Keogh or
                           Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans can be 
made up until the due date of your return, which
                           can be later than April 16 with a filing 
extension. 

                           Estimated tax deadline: For self-employed workers 
and other individuals who need to make
                           quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS, April 
16 also is the deadline for making the first
                           installment for 2001. "

This email was supposed to be delivered the week after the Happy Hour. Something went wrong and it never got delivered. I still want you and Karen to read it. 

Rick,

Thank you for inviting us to the Happy Hour last week. As always these events help us to break the silos in which we tend to work some 
times. In this occasion I made two new friends and had the opportunity to discuss business maters with the people that work in Rick Carson group. After finishing the 3-Quarter revaluation process, I feel that Underwriting and Due Diligence can work much more closer, shearing information and experiences from the Due diligence site visits.  

Happy boss day

126,"The above transaction was presented to the Board on 1-29-2001. There was 
considerable discussion which I have summarized below.

Returns: were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk. I answered 
positively, which is what the capital price addresses. The dash return is a 
blended debt and equity return.(?)

Was the $19 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate. I 
answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be 
needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves.

Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 11 again soon. 
I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal 
and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below 
outstanding. We will have to watch this issue carefully.

Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem? 
Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come 
into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough 
cash to operate.

This feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and 
not a rubber stamp.

140,"Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature 
Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She 
was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts 
to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may 
have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed 
route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did  
offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area 
which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.  

The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological 
regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and 
animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The 
TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be 
used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed 
prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of 
Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of 
ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species 
which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be 
impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction 
across Arizona.  

I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition 
to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the 
environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the 
pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and 
unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle 
on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this 
piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful 
the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known."

"
144,"Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in 
fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?   The reason I ask 
is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix 
D.  We  have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other 
compressor station locations and have been approved to use ""stain tubes"" or 
total sulfur analyzers.  These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.  I can 
send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help.  
If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below 
referenced test methods and we will work out the details.  WIll it be 
possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we 
have more time to taylor the permit  for you and us?

153,"Dear Market Participants,

On November 15, 2000, the New York Independent System Operator,
Inc. filed a reformatted version of the NYISO Open Access Transmission
Tariff (OATT).  The new version is entitled New York Independent System
Operator, Inc.,  FERC Electric Tariff,  Original Volume No. 1.

This filing was made to comply with the FERC's Order No. 614, issued
March 31, 2000 in Docket No. RM99-12-000, 99 FERC   61,352 (2000).
Order 614 amended the FERC's regulations concerning the designation
of electric rate schedule sheets. This order changed the titles and
other administrative information to be shown at the top and bottom of
each tariff sheet, thus necessitating that the NYISO modify the information
included on the NYISO's tariff sheets.

The tariff filed on November 15, 2000 does not include any change in
the content of the tariff.  It does include the administrative changes
described above and a repagination and reformatting to facilitate
existing and future changes.  This tariff includes all tariff modifications
that were filed before September 1, 2000, and have been approved by the
FERC.  The tariff does not reflect filings made on or after September 1, 2000.
The tariff also does not reflect the NYISO's February 11, 2000 compliance
filing in Docket No. ER97-1523-029, which still awaits Commission action.

Once this tariff has been approved by the FERC, the NYISO will create and
post a consolidated version of the OATT that shows all approved and
proposed changes.  This new consolidated version will be comparable to
and replace the current consolidated OATT posted on the NYISO website.

The November 15, 2000 filing can be found on the NYISO website at:

161,"Lou-
I think the previous numbers are a bit low now. In December, 1999, we 
installed four downgradient monitor wells on off-site property owned by the 
Nature Conservancy. Samples from these wells confirm a contaminant plume of 
arsenic in the shallow groundwater emanating from the release area. Another 
development is the recent accumulation of product in some of our recovery 
wells that is different in characteristic from what we were previously 
dealing with. This indicates that we are possibly pulling in product from 
another source that we have not yet identified (although I suspect a nearby 
sump location as the culprit). We have another drilling program in the works 
for this year to further delineate the downgradient extent of the arsenic 
plume and to evaluate the other potential source of accumulated product. This 
work is tentatively scheduled for the latter part of August or September. 
Please let me know if this schedule should be accelerated or deferred due to 
a pending sale agreement. Another consideration related to off-site 
contamination, the Railroad Commission has not yet requested that NNG notify 
affected property owners, but I suspect that such a request is forthcoming. I 
am in the process of preparing a letter, addressed to you, identifying the 
affected property located between the facility and the Nature Conservancy 
property. 

In light of these considerations and the continued interest by the Railroad 
Commission, I have adjusted the spending forecast as follows:
2000    $100k
2001    $100k
2002    $60k
2003    $20k
2004    $20k
2005+  $20k
Total   $320,000+
Notes regarding this forecast:
1) This should be viewed as an optimistic forecast (i.e., if everything goes 
fairly well).
2) No $ are included in this forecast for managing off-site property issues 
that may arise.
3) Assumes that a second source area is confirmed and additional recovery 
wells will be installed next year to recover PSH from this area. 
4) Assumes that the existing recovery system will be adequate for continued 
operations.
5) Assumes that the recovery system continues to operate through 2002.
6) Assumes that the Railroad Commission will continue to renew the minor 
permit for disposal of recovered liquids.
7) Assumes that quarterly groundwater sampling will continue at least through 
2005.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals
The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new ""Morning Briefing"" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

183,"My understanding now on this is that we are talking about the Bridgeline 
deal.  In that deal, Enron and Texaco both assigned employees to work for the 
Bridgeline entity.  It is done under a secundment arrangement, and the 
employees are sent there via an assignment letter.   (Pat, you may recall 
that we visited about this process a while back, although I may not have 
given you the transaction name at the time).  

So, currently, all Enron personnel assigned to Bridgeline actually are Enron 
employees.  I am not aware of any change to that structure.  Fran, do you 
know of any changes?  Are we now going to transfer all of those employees to 
the Bridgeline entity?  Those answers would help.

 "
188,"If I were Bill's lawyer, I would assume the same thing.  That would be great if we could call it all off - I would think we need to get some documentation to that affect?

 "
189,"i think this is fairly final... I added one more question.

 

 "
190,"The company's determination that leave will be counted as FMLA must be communicated to the employee within two business days of the company receiving sufficient information to determine FMLA coverage.  The employer must commit that to writing by the next payday (or the one after that, if the next payday is less than a week from the date oral notice was given).  This requirement should be communicated to HR/supervisors for compliance purposes. 

--Lizzette"
191,"
The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. 

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  

Origination
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. 

Trading
Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  

Shipping
Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.

Enron Japan
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.

LNG
LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.  

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.

In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses."
192," As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

221,"I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding.  
The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 
and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation 
from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.  
We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks 
like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried 
about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical 
moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.  
After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get 
tropical  moisture.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

SEB FONTAINE
GLOBAL UNDERGROUND = PROTOTYPE- CD Release Tour 

Seb Fontaine has rescheduled his appearance at HYPERIA. This October, 25th, the global domination of this heavily demanded DJ Stops in Houston at Hyperia!

Seb has dance music in his blood from the day he was conceived in Ibiza - his mother is a semi-professional DJ.
Growing up in West London, Seb?s initial musical development was stimulated by ska, but soon dropped out of sixth form college to pursue a career as a DJ. His first ?proper? gig was at Crazy Larry?s on the Kings Road, getting paid ?30 a night to spin tunes for a typical Eighties ?sloanie? crew.

By 1989, Seb landed a residency at The Fridge, Brixton, where he played mainly hip hop and rare groove, swiftly followed a year later by a residency at The Wag, playing ragga, rare groove and acid. Next came a residency at Subterania, alongside Norman Jay and Jeremy Healy. In 1993, Seb gained his first house residency at Glitterati at The Cross.

Malibu Stacey was the next stop for Seb - a night he put together and promoted at the Hanover Grand with friend Craig Richards. As Malibu got more established, Seb got increasingly restless, and took to the road in a big way, focusing more and more outside of London, becoming one of the UK?s hardest working ?motorway jocks?. At the same time, music becomes harder and deeper.

In 1998, Seb was offerred a fortnightly residency at Cream, which soon became a weekly gig. In 1999, Seb took Ibiza by storm, with Cream at Amnesia.

Seb Fontaine clinched the deal with Radio 1 in February 2000, initially to deputise for dance shows exclusively on Radio 1, gaining him the nickname ?super-sub?. He also joins Radio 1 in its mammoth summer of live music at the major dance festivals, and at the station?s own Radio 1 Dance Parties.

The survey will take between 15 and 20 minutes to complete. In exchange for your time (after completing the survey) you will receive $20.

The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 
and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation 
from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.  
We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks 
like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried 
about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical 
moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.  
After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get 
tropical  moisture.

Stand up, Texas, against California's bullying 
By JONATHAN WILCOX 


LADIES and gentlemen: May I present to you the Hon. Bill Lockyer, attorney 
general of the state of California, from the May 22 Wall Street Journal: 

""I would love to personally escort (Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth) Lay to an 8 
x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, `Hi, my name is 
Spike, honey.' "" 

When you stop gagging, join me in celebrating Lockyer's crude, lewd and 
unsubdued behavior. It has stripped away whatever veneer of respectability 
California officials had by virtue of the offices they hold and exposed them 
as braggarts and bullies of the first order. But they also wield enormous and 
destructive power -- and they intend to use it. 

The sooner Texans realize this the better. 

As citizens of the state that is home to much of the nation's energy 
production, the people of Texas are intimately familiar with the booms and 
busts of the oil and natural gas industries. Sometimes, prices are high, new 
supply is nigh and willing buyers can only sigh. 

Other times, gluts occur, demand fluctuates, competition grows ruthless and 
revenues seep out like the last remnants of black crude from a stripper well. 

These are the principles of American capitalism, free market forces and the 
give-and-take and push-pull that separate this nation's economic capacity 
from all others. It is a fundamentally fair system, it has served us 
remarkably well and every time we have tampered with it, it has been to our 
ultimate detriment. 

Witness California's partial ""deregulation"" of its electricity market. 

The Golden State, for all its vanity, pride and preening machismo, actually 
knows very little of tough times. Sure, we can handle the occasional 
spectacular episode, like an earthquake or wildfire. That's part of the 
thrill of living in California. 

But when it comes to our economic expectations and their interrelationship 
with our desired lifestyle, we only know the California way: more, more often 
and with no end in sight. 

And if we don't get what we want, when we want it, it's someone else's fault. 

In that light, it is no surprise that we are saddled with our current 
governor, Gray Davis, and our current law enforcement chief, the 
aforementioned Lockyer. 

Despite his frequent jittery appearances on national television, Davis is a 
politically shrewd man. He may not know which public policy choices are best 
for the state's future, but that's not his highest priority. 

Item No. 1 on Davis' ""To Do"" list is to get re-elected next year. But this 
has been complicated by the state's year of energy woes, Davis' ineffectual 
response and the fact that California is a largely one-party state. 

Of California's eight statewide elected offices, seven are held by Democrats, 
including Davis and Lockyer. You don't have to be a Delphic oracle to discern 
that if Davis gets tossed out, he will take more than a few of his political 
brethren with him. 

So, as California tiptoes toward its long, hot summer of rolling blackouts 
and unprecedented electricity shortages, Davis is busy digging his personal 
bomb shelter. He's preparing for the big one, calculating that while the 
damage will be great, and the fallout potentially lethal, he and the other 
cockroaches, like Lockyer, will survive. 

How will they do this? By finding some fall guys to take the rap. 

Call it the Texas two-step: First, Davis declares ""war"" on Texas energy 
producers. Next, Lockyer says he expects to file civil charges against 
suppliers, with, he hopes, criminal counts to follow. 

For a demonstration of how not to deal with Lockyer and other California 
aggressors, examine the rejoinder of Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for 
corporate communications. Lockyer's comment about Lay, he said, ""is so 
counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response."" 

Wrong. Weak. Ineffective. Decency in the face of demagoguery may be 
dignified, but it's little more than an invitation to further abuse and, for 
Enron, public villainy. 

Enron had a chance to do something corporations under hostile government fire 
only dream about: Embarrass, disarm and neutralize a corrupt public official 
out to smear their good name. 

By challenging Lockyer to either reassess or renounce his remarks, Enron 
could have injected common sense and rare truth into a debate that has become 
twisted and warped by the tirades of California officials. Best of all, Enron 
could have extracted the kind of retraction that would have adorned Lockyer 
with the scarlet ""A"" of contrite politicians: apology. 

Lockyer and other state officials may not yet know the ceiling of scorn Enron 
will tolerate from them. But they surely know the floor: Joking with 
journalists of the pleasure they would take from the arranged assault of 
Kennth Lay in a California prison.

267,"Jeff,

I received the good news yesterday that Edison (SCE) will be a sponsor of
our conference at the $5000 level. I know that you (and of course GSPP) want
Enron to be a sponsor as well. I am trying to help you make this a reality,
and to firm up commitments so that we can publicize them starting with our
first mailing scheduled for next week. By the way, Laura Tyson has given
preliminary acceptance to moderate our first panel.

Following this message, I am sending you a second message that you could
circulate to any others in your company that you wish. It describes two
levels of sponsorship. I wanted to be sure that you know of the options that
we are offering to all of our potential sponsors. I am expecting not only
SCE and Columbia Energy but PG&E and Reliance Energy to become sponsors (we
have a great alum at Reliance, Glen Sweetnam). One or more of them may well
go for the Major Sponsorship, which of course will be especially recognized.
Ticket purchases can count toward sponsorships as indicated. We would be
pleased to count the market value of in-kind streaming video services toward
sponsorship (which I understand is something like $1500).

Would you like me to contact Tim Belden about this? Anything else I can do?

Thanks for all of your help with this Jeff. It's going to be a great event
for the School.

285,"Calif Republicans May Prevail With 'Bailout' For Edison  ????
Updated: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 03:17 PM?ET ????? 
?
By Jason Leopold 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Assembly Republicans could upstage Democrats in the 
California Assembly Wednesday in a bid to rescue ailing utility Southern 
California Edison Co. from insolvency. 

And they may do so with a bill its backers unabashedly call a ""straight 
bailout"" for the Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit. 

""This how the minority in the Assembly can use their votes to derail majority 
legislation,"" Jamie Fisfis, spokesman for the Assembly Republican Caucus, 
said Wednesday. 

The bipartisan bill, introduced by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D-South Central 
Los Angeles, and Assemblyman Keith Richman, R-Granada Hills, capitalizes on 
partisan politics and dissatisfaction with several elements of a competing 
bill sponsored by Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assembly 
Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek. 

Both bills face a critical vote Wednesday in the Energy Costs and 
Availability Committee. Wright said he's secured nine votes for his bill on 
the 20-person committee - the eight Republicans and one Democrat. Keeley's 
office said his bill needs one more vote. 

""It's going to be close,"" Wright said minutes before the committee hearing. 

Assembly Republicans and some Democrats are concerned by provisions in the 
Hertzberg bill that would have the state buy the utility's transmission 
lines, limit consumers' ability to choose their power provider and place the 
burden of the rescue on businesses. 

Bill Forgoes Power-Line Buyout 

Wright's bill would forgo those measures, instead allowing Southern 
California Edison to recoup more than $3.5 billion in unrecovered power costs 
through a surcharge placed on utility bills in exchange for a commitment by 
the utility to sell power from its generation units to the state at cost. 

Southern California Edison executives said the Hertzberg-Keeley bill, which 
would require the company to absorb some of its wholesale-power losses, 
wouldn't allow the company to become creditworthy and return to the power 
business any time soon. 

Consumer groups have criticized both plans as bailouts and have vowed to 
overturn the rescue efforts if either is enacted. Business groups, including 
the state's Chamber of Commerce and the California Manufacturers and 
Technology Association, said if large businesses are stuck paying for the 
bailout, consumers will feel the pinch through increased costs in the retail 
sector. 

Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor is 
""working with the Legislature for an appropriate balance that does not place 
any undue burden on any sector."" 

Lawmakers have until Aug. 15 to pass legislation supporting an April 
memorandum of understanding between Southern California Edison and the state, 
but have an effective deadline of Friday, the last day before a month-long 
summer break. 

Neither bill in the Assembly nor another bill in the Senate implements in 
full the terms of the MOU, which calls for the state to buy the utility's 
transmission lines for $2.76 billion and allow it to issue bonds to recover 
$3.5 billion in wholesale power costs it hasn't been able to recover from 
customers, whose rates are frozen. 

Edison has said it faces bankruptcy if lawmakers don't act by the MOU's 
August deadline.

State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy 
Assembly plans own version for utility 
Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday, July 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL 
Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern 
California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an 
alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an 
uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of 
Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's 
transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 
billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in 
debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained 
frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last 
night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of 
mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation 
haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk 
before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and 
Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, 
but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
""It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior 
to the end of the legislative recess,"" Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to 
iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that 
could be accomplished in the next few days. 
""I have problems with both bills,"" Davis said. ""I am heartened by the fact 
that there's a bill moving in each house."" 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to 
a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the 
process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats 
and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its 
current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
""The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal,"" she said. ""This 
particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to 
protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being 
cannibalized."" 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off 
alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off 
through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not 
cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, 
which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since 
January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the 
utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal 
would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change 
their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman 
Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to 
garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines 
and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the 
Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
""It's a cleaner bill,"" Alquist said. ""I think it comes down to whether this 
does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say 
I'm tentatively satisfied."" 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature 
of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former 
state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 
legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the 
Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the 
measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
""As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. 
I have a lot of questions,"" Simitian said. ""The difficulty is that very 
little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a 
deadline, too much gets done."" 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was 
getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy 
crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings 
and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- 
Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called ""straight 
bailout"" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied 
on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

In addition, all this buzz about conflicts with traders and Calpine could put 
in jeopardy the state's contracts with Calpine, which may, in the end, be a 
very good thing for Direct Access.
Davis spokesman under fire for stock 
By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published July 31, 2001) 
Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he 
bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was 
announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose power 
plant. 
His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state 
power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that 
Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private 
finances and their public roles. 
Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the 
administration, said he put in an ""open"" order for Calpine stock May 31, 
agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price. 
He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down ""all energy stock prices 
across the board."" 
Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and 
it has since declined in value. Under terms of the open order, he said, he 
had no control over the exact date of purchase. 
Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a 
story published June 27 in The Bee. He said Monday that he was simply 
responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation. 
""They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future,"" 
Maviglio said at the time. ""Their pricing has been far more reasonable than 
any other generator."" 
In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based 
generators. He said Calpine ""took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the 
world,"" an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with 
Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston. 
Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the 
administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who 
held stock in energy companies, including Calpine. 
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to 
challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent 
several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and 
potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders. 
Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired. 
""These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads should 
roll,"" he said in a statement. He said the Democratic governor should direct 
all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements 
to reflect current holdings. 
Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the 
probe should be expanded ""to include all of the governor's staff."" 
Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while 
possessing ""insider information"" -- relevant facts not available to the 
public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal 
prosecution. 
Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the 
prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from 
profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly. 
But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees. 
Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by 
insider-trading crackdowns. 
Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for 
removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30, 
after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced 
he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support 
construction. 
His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as 
the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections. 
On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to 
build the plant. 
Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the 
only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which 
he purchased in 1996. 
""I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this 
was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public 
knowledge,"" he said. ""I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's 
going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in something 
that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at 
all."" 
Maviglio said that the ""open"" order he placed meant that he could not have 
used inside information to make his stock purchase. 
""Had I had specific knowledge about a contract being signed or what actually 
happened in the office of the mayor of San Jose ... that would have been 
unrelated,"" Maviglio said. ""There was no timing-based sequence to it."" 
Calpine stock, despite the company's considerable success, has slipped in 
recent weeks because of general investor anxiety about the California energy 
crisis. 
The stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $49.30 on 
May 31, the day Maviglio says he placed the purchase order. The order was 
executed as the stock dipped below $40 on June 20, closing that day at 
$39.85. 
The day before, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a 
price-control plan that investors believed was damaging to generators' 
profits. On Monday, the stock closed at $37.13. 
Last week, the Davis administration stopped doing business with five energy 
traders under contract with the administration after Maviglio said 
administration lawyers ""came to the determination that there are possible 
violations of the law or close to it."" 
""It's not a crime to own energy stock,"" Maviglio said Monday. ""The difference 
with these traders is they're making governmental decisions. They're 
committing the state's resources by spending money to buy power."" 
Jim Knox, director of California Common Cause, said he believes the 
Governor's Office made critical errors while hiring staff to purchase energy 
for the state. 
""Had the Governor's Office gone to the trouble to have these people fill 
statements of economic interest, as they were required to do by law, they 
should have known this before they were hired and they shouldn't have been 
hired,"" Knox said.

295,"Greetings.  The reference is specific to statements that we made when FERC 
first issued it's proposed order on Nov. 1 regarding how to fix the mess in 
California.  We said (and FERC was a little cranky about this) that we were 
pulling 300 MWs of power plants that we'd planned to build in California on 
the basis of the price cap proposal included in FERC's proposed order.  It 
was in the press.  So it was narrowly confined to the power plant proposals.  
Calpine subsequently announced that it, too, would pull the peaking plants it 
had planned to developed.  I think that they announced the same amount would 
be pulled"
296,"Jeff,

While, in general, I agree with your premise about the relative importance
of PG&E and SoCalGas, Edison is deliberately taking a low profile
""observer"" tone in the new Gas Accord talks.

However, we are suffering some resource constraints, and so our involvement
must also be dictated by other work demands and the status of the
proceeding.  Even though Norman has made a bonehead play (and may or may
not have some support from the Canadians, according to the rumors I've
heard) In general, we'd prefer to let others advance the cause, and if
consistent with SCE's basic position, we can lend our support through
joining a common filing or providing separate comments in support.

I would appreciate being kept on the mailing list, and am willing to offer
my intellectual support to your efforts, but, at this point, would prefer
not to ""sign on,"" at this time.  However, resources permitting, I will put
extra effort into making the next meeting, and to letting Edison's feelings
on the matter be known.

Meanwhile, Brian Cherry told me that ALJ Biren did send a draft PD on the
SoCalGas restructuring to Bialas who has been sitting on it for a few weeks
now.  Neither he nor I knew why (we can speculate, but that's all), but the
delay is not good.  Do you have any insider information to add?

Good to see you again Monday, and nice to finally meet this girlfriend who
you keep talking about, but, apparently, were not making up after all :-)

I don't know how any ""concerns"" I may have raised reached you, but rest

I saw the piece on the local news.  Vacar's on a one-person crusade to kill

out of context, and they did you a great disservice.  

Just between us chickens, it did come up as if you were implying that there's 
some reasonable likelihood that manipulation's the culprit.  You can imagine 
just how sensitive we are to that issue.  But I don't think that you should 
sweat it.  In a very brief conversation with Mike Day I mentioned the piece 
and that they got you responding to manipulation (i.e., ""when'd you stop

304,"Jeanne,

I have some more background on the PX Credit issue that leads me to believe 
that we should still comment on PG&E's Advice Letter.

The current PX credit calculation relies on the existence of a PX price
The PX price does not consistently reflect market prices.
Market prices are only reflected if:
buyers and seller are willing to take on credit risk by transacting in the 
market
the legalities of ""who is liable for what"" in case of default are unclear 
(according to a VP at EPMI), so the liquidity will not increase until there 
is certainty

From our perspective, the market value as posted on the PX is better for PX 
credit calculations than a constrained ISO price.  (There is no unconstrained 
ISO price available.)  Although -- it's a risk.

However, if the PX becomes so dysfunctional that prices, if any, do not 
reflect real market pricing at all, the CPUC cannot delay dealing with this 
issue because there will be no status quo for them to leave in place, there 
will be a void.

I suggest that we support the CPUC decision to delay hearing the advice 
letter with a big HOWEVER.  I think we should highlight the questionable 
viability of a PX price and bring forward the requirement that the CPUC must 
act if the PX becomes completely dysfunctional (we could ask Neil Bresnan for 
help in defining ""dysfunctional"").

311,"Greetings Justin and Laura:
As we discussed there is a significant coalition of folks working at the 
Legislature to try to remove the prohibition on Direct Access included in 
Hertzberg's AB1X and recently signed by the Governor.

Simply put, it is clear that the prohibition will only be removed if the 
business community communicates clearly  and unequivocally and vociferously 
to the Legislature that Direct Access is a priority for business, and that 
the Legislature must amend AB1X to permit Direct Access.

I've attached the media plan developed by the PR firm that's working with ARM 
(Alliance for Retail Markets) to increase the focus on the need to re-instate 
Direct Access.  The ARM coalition of energy service providers has been the 
focal point of the ever-growing coalition that has developed (and continues 
to develop) around the Direct Access issue.

In order to succeed, it is critical to get as many members of the Silicon 
Valley Manufactures' Group to join in the effort and participate actively,

room 4202.

The Assembly passed the state budget."
320,"Folks:
Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.

They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding ""spot market service"" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as ""an option to elect.""  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a ""backstop,"" in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.

Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any ""stakes in the ground"" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.

In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., ""what to do about DA in the interm?""  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.

Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.

Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).

OUR PHYSICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA

EES has electricity customers within the territories of SCE, PG&E, and SDG&E 
(about 800 MW of usage) [NOTE - CHECK WITH EES].  EES has natural gas 
customers within the territories PG&E and SoCal Gas.

Enron does not have any generation in California (we own a small QF in Nevada 
but only have 50 MW excess).  

We supply power to the Utilities and to our retail load by buying excess in 
California or by transmitting power into the state.  Enron sells natural gas 
to the LDCs mainly under spot arrangements.

Enron continues to manage the risk by using traditional hedging tools and by 
using the full complement of resources of EES - demand reduction, load 
shaping, and efficiency improvements.

Transwestern has long-term capacity arrangements with PG&E.

OUR POLITICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA / MESSAGES

The current situation (shortages and potential bankruptcy) is not the result 
of competitive markets, rather it is the result of barriers to workable 
retail and wholesale markets designed into the California deregulation model 
(for instance, the overreliance of the Utilities on the spot market, the 
residual CTC calculation, incomplete retail tariff unbundling requiring 
direct access customers to pay more than their fair share for the Utilities' 
common costs). 

Enron does not want to see the California Utilities go bankrupt because those 
naysayers of competition will use this situation as an argument against 
competition.  Enron disagrees.  What it proves is that not finishing the job 
of creating real competition can result in problems.  

Enron believes that there are workable short-term and long-term solutions for 
California.

In the short-term, (1) California must provide credit enhancement or directly 
buy power for the Utilities' needs to ensure a stable supply of electricity, 
(2) California should incent customers to institute demand reductions, and 
(3) California should raise rates to cover reasonable costs so that the 
Utilities do not petition for bankruptcy.

In the long-term, (1) California needs to continue its activities to promote 
retail competition (and most importantly it must allow real price signals to 
be sent to large customers), (2) California should implement the changes that 
the FERC highlighted (end the reliance on the spot market, remove 
stakeholders on the Cal ISO Board, give the Utilties the ability to recover 
wholesale power costs), (3) California must remove unnecessary barriers to 
the development of additional generation capacity, and, most importantly, (4) 
California must establish reasonable structures so that the Utilities develop 
a balanced portfolio of supplies to better manage electricity market 
volatility.

California should not get into the business of owning or operating generation 
assets or transmission facilities.  

California should not stop moving forward with retail competitition which 
allows customers to manage price risk rather than some regulator.

KEY ENRON ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA

We do have outstanding deliveries into the California utilities and would be 
an unsecured creditor if bankruptcy occurs. We continue to sell to 
creditworthy counterparties in Western Power markets. [NOTE - THE AMOUNT OF 
RISK IS AN IR ISSUE THEY WANT TO MANAGE].

The PX Credit (and associated negative CTC) continues to be an issue.  Enron 
believes that the rate freeze has not yet ended legally and PG&E's and SCE's 
tariff requires the Utilities to pay funds to the customer's agent.  We filed 
a Complaint Friday January 19 at the CPUC.  We are confident that these funds 
will be recovered.  [NOTE - I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS - AGAIN 
AN IR ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE RECEIVABLE]

326,"All,
Lee asked me to forward this.  I'm still awaiting additional suggestions from
anyone on speakers.

I guess Lee's e-mail changes things.  If the business school wants to go 
forward
with a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one.  
Jeff
has said he likes the idea of coordinating.  Bill and Allen, what do you 
think?
I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chief
economist at DOJ.  As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanford
economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than
anyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK,
Australia, and California.  He speaks a mile a minute though and his
understanding of policy and politics is a bit naive.

I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute.  I heard from Michael
Berg this morning.  So he will not be participating in our discussions either.

My opinion is let's do whatever is best for the school.  One positive outcome 
of
this would be stronger relationships with some of the University's top notch
economic policy faculty.  Overshadowing is possible.  Lee, does Dean Nacht 
have
a view on joint sponsorship?
Rob

> "
327,"Not necessarily for purposes of discussion on the SCE call, but for later
reference if we have to fight SCE over the justification for their crediting
proposal, I want to chime in with my critique of SCE's analysis.  

First of all, their example does not properly characterize the obligations
of the direct access customers.  A Direct access customer (with the same
hypothetical load as in the SCE example) did not pay the same $60 toward
SCE's procurement costs and transition recovery, they paid a lesser sum, $60
minus the actual PX costs for that billing cycle.  What the direct access
customer paid (assuming the PX costs were $30), was a contribution directly
to CTC transition cost recovery, in this case $30.   

When the price of energy exceeded the 6 cents in bundled rates for
procurement and transition cost recovery, the utility does begin to build an
undercollection from its bundled customers, and the entire $80
undercollection in the SCE example relates to the cost of power purchased
for the bundled customer but not recovered in rates.

The same is NOT TRUE for the direct access customer.  The negative credit
provided to the direct access customer is the same as the underrecovery from
the bundled service customer, in this case $80.  However, for the direct
access customer, this amount has nothing to do with power purchased by the
utility for the DA customer, and represents essentially a credit against
amounts overpaid toward the utility's CTC recovery in earlier periods.  

This is one of the many perverse effects of the residual CTC collection
mechanism.  If a fixed CTC contribution had been established from Day 1,
direct access customers could have continued to pay that fixed contribution,
also pay their $40 share of the utility T&D costs, and would not have had
any role in creating the utility's undercollection.  However, because the
CTC calculation was a residual calculation:  the generation component of the
frozen rates less the actual PX costs = CTC (which later became negative)
direct access customers' contribution to CTC was dependent on the utility's
procurement risk in the market compared to the generation component in
frozen rates.  This was also consistent with the notion contained in AB 1890
and the Edison MOU that the utility bore the risk of power price volatility
in recovering its CTC.

In order for direct access customers to contribute to CTC symmetrically with
bundled customers, when bundled customers no longer contributed to CTC
(because of high power costs) and in fact REDUCED the CTC collected (the
power cost undercollection was to have been paid first before CTC was
booked, but the PUC did not properly account for this until it adopted the
TURN accounting adjustment), then the CTC contribution of direct access
customers had to be proportionately reduced, and that is the function of the
negative CTC credit.

Thus, a reduction in the CTC contribution of direct access customers to
ensure they paid the same proportionate share of CTC as bundled customers is
NOT a matter which SCE is entitled to recover after the fact because they
sustained an undercollection of power costs.  The undercollection of power
costs was entirely their risk, and direct access customers paid their fair
share of CTC and that is all they had to pay, period.  The fact that they
paid less than SCE expected because the high power costs generated a lot of
negative CTC credits at the end of the transition period is one more risk
that the utilities assumed when they selfishly and foolishly promoted a
residual CTC calculation instead of a fixed transition cost recovery system
as was used in most other states.  SCE is entitled to NO recovery of its
undercollection from direct access customers.

As you can tell, I am more than willing to discuss this ad infinitum.  If
you have questions, please call or email.

Crisis? What Crisis?
By HOLMAN W. JENKINS, JR.

The big news this summer is that Californians haven't been reduced to stone-age lifestyles, running naked in the streets and eating each other.

The state barely had enough electricity to get through this past winter, when demand was not yet pumped up with air-conditioning. Yet here they are surviving the summer with nary a blackout. Gov. Gray Davis must be some kind of a wizard, pulling 15,000 megawatts from his pointy hat. He gave every indication of being a hapless cluck, but obviously we underestimated him.

 
Naah. California's summer of surplus demonstrates just how flukey last winter's rolling blackouts were. Power there was aplenty (or at least enough to get by). What there wasn't was anybody to pay for it, thanks to the political system's paralysis as the state's private utilities ran out of cash and used up their credit trying to keep the lights on.

We won't rehearse the central pinion of this catastrophe, a ""deregulation"" plan that created scarcity pricing in the absence of true scarcity. A tweak here and there as late as last fall could have saved the state's taxpayers and ratepayers literally billions of dollars at no real cost to anybody. Instead, the utilities were allowed simply to run out of money, accumulating $14 billion in unpayable IOUs to generators.

Now, most of us tend to think of power plants as giant coal or nuclear operations that run 24 hours a day, supplying ""baseload"" power. But the majority of plants are part-timers, firing up to meet intermediate and peak demand. Revving up their turbines means incurring fuel, labor and maintenance costs, which means operators like to get paid. The crisis months saw three distinct waves of blackouts, each related to plants dropping off line simply because they feared not getting paid.

In January, it was British Columbia Hydro, the big, government-owned operator of Canadian dams, which had kept California afloat on credit for months.

In March it was dozens of small California generators, known as ""qualifying facilities,"" which no longer could meet their own fuel and labor bills because they weren't getting paid by their utility customers.

In July, it was the federal government imposing impenetrably complex price controls across the West, making it impossible for generators to know what price they were allowed to charge. Some shut down rather than take a chance, and since the federal intervention meant the entire region was on the griddle for California's mismanagement, the blackouts just happened to land in Nevada.

There was no shortage, in other words, no ""energy crisis."" There was only the unaddressed credit problems of the utilities.

We opined in January that Californians would be surprised at how quickly power prices return to normal. Yup. The state threw open the treasury to pay for the power the utilities could no longer afford and suddenly sellers were everywhere and prices fell. In the teeth of peak air-conditioning season, electricity prices are now back to normal.

In retrospect, what's amazing is that so many plants not only kept operating month after month despite being stiffed by the state, but produced 62% more power than they had the year before to keep California lit. Yet they've gotten nothing but abuse from the governor, who is still turning over every legal stone to try to avoid paying the IOUs.

There is no question that Western supplies were tighter than usual thanks to low water levels in Northwest river systems. But the evidence shows that Western markets were flexible enough to accommodate the glitches. All they needed was a creditworthy customer to deal with.

Unfortunately, Californians won't be benefiting from the return of normal pricing. In the throes of an ""energy crisis,"" Gov. Davis signed $43 billion in long-term power contracts at ridiculously high prices.

Hardly was the ink dry on these deals before he was forced to begin selling this unneeded power back into the market at losses of 80 cents on the dollar. It gets worse. Last week came the most humiliating revelation of all. Officials have ordered one of the state's most efficient suppliers, a coal-fired plant that delivers power at a cost of two cents per kilowatt-hour, to dump its power into the ground so consumers can use Mr. Davis's high-cost power instead.

The truth being too gruesome to acknowledge, politicians have devoted themselves to peddling false lessons from all this. The state's new energy czar, David Freeman, insists the mess points up the advantages of socialism to protect the public from shortages. Less insanely, others blame California's rampant not-in-my-backyardism, but even this wasn't really the cause of the meltdown.

It's true California didn't build a major power plant during the 1990s, thanks to lingering surpluses and a raucous debate over the future of deregulation. But a regional wholesale market was already in full swing, allowing the West's existing complement of plants to be used more efficiently. And California actually did manage to add about 6,000 megawatts of output in the 1990s from small plants, thanks to joint federal-state rules that guaranteed a market for every erg they could churn out.

Never mind. The one thing politicians of every stripe can't let voters understand is that there was never any ""energy crisis,"" only a grotesque act of fiscal mismanagement.

Some $25 billion in annual power consumption was transformed into a bill for $50 billion for no good economic reason that anybody could possibly defend. By refusing to look this fact in the eye, Californians have set themselves up to keep paying inflated prices for decades to come.

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

<<IPW072301.pdf>>
Summary:
1. IPPs Fall 9.4%   In terms of stock price performance, last week was
lackluster for the Independent Power Producers.  Our composite was down
9.4%, underperforming both the NASDAQ (-2.7%) and the S&P 500 (-0.4%).
International Power was the strongest performer in the group, rising 4.9%.
The Shaw Group was the weakest, falling 15.6%.

2. Mild Weather Exposes Companies with Portfolio Risk   We attribute last
week's poor performance to indications that some companies (e.g. CEG and
KSE) are experiencing earnings pressure due to mild weather and its impact
on power market conditions.  While investors interpreted these events as a
sign of deteriorating industry fundamentals, we view them as more the result
of company specific portfolio risk, i.e., lack of geographic diversity.  We
remain comfortable with our earnings forecasts for the bulk of the major
IPPs.  In particular, we highlight our top 2 picks --Calpine and Mirant-- as
having the least portfolio risk owing to a combination of geographical
diversity, stringent hedging policies and a strong risk management skillset.


3. Looking Ahead: Earnings Reports from AES, CPN and NRG   This week we
await earnings reports from AES, Calpine and NRG Energy.  We believe an
upside surprise is most likely from Calpine, which will report earnings on
Thursday (7/26).  Our estimate is $0.30 versus the $0.19 earned last year.
While we expect AES to meet our $0.29 estimate, we believe weakness at its
Brazilian operations has the potential to negatively impact 2001 EPS by
$0.25-$0.30 (see our FC note dated July 16).  Following AES's conference
call on Thursday, we will adjust our $1.89 2001 estimate accordingly, unless
management continues to indicate sufficient upside in other parts of its
portfolio.

4. FASB Goodwill Update   On Friday (7/20), the FASB published two
standards, Statement 141, Business Combinations, and Statement 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.  The most immediate impact of the new standards
will be the elimination of the requirement that goodwill be amortized.  In
this report we outline the EPS impact that results from the cessation of
goodwill amortization for the companies in the power generation sector.  In
the near future, we intend to issue separate report where we formally adjust
our 2002 earnings estimates.

5. CSFB Power Generation Supply Chain Conference   On September 10 and 11,
CSFB will host a Power Generation Supply Chain Conference at the Plaza Hotel
in New York City.  This event is designed to provide investors with a
wholistic perspective on all aspects of the sector-from coal and natural gas
companies, to equipment and construction service providers, to the power
producers themselves.  Please contact us if you would like additional
information.

FERC has two meetings in July (July 11 and 25) and then is on recess for the 
month of August.  The next FERC meeting after July will not be held until 
September 12.  Consequently, FERC tries to get out as many orders as it can 
in July so the backlog is not as great in September.  

Consistent with that goal, FERC has included a lot of cases on its July 11 
agenda.   While some of these cases may be stricken from the agenda for July 
11(and either deferred to the July 25 meeting or until September), we are 
still expecting a lot of action from FERC in July.  The following cases are 
on FERC's July 11 agenda:

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail
By Daniel Taub 
Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray 
Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity 
market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a 
misdirected e-mail. 
The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was 
intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve 
Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press 
list, he said. 
Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would 
compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a 
state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and 
confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is 
buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt. 
``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a 
meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail 
contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. 
According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of 
electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough 
electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged 
from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the 
e-mail is accurate. 
Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a 
megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to 
Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot 
market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher 
than on the day-ahead market. 
The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a 
quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each 
season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law 
requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.

Turn off PCs, monitors, printers, and copiers when not in use or not needed=
.
If you cannot turn off the entire computer, turn off the monitor and the
printer.
Disable the screensaver on your monitor, and enable the power management
tool on your PC.
Turn off lights in unoccupied rooms, and ""half-dim"" lights in occupied
rooms.
Send documents via email instead of fax.
Remove excess lights. Many older office and warehouse buildings have more
lighting then needed. In many areas, half the light may be sufficient to
light the area. When removing excess fluorescent tubes, remember to
disconnect the ballasts that serve them.
In the winter, keep draperies and shades on south-facing windows open to
allow sunlight to enter your home; and close them at night to reduce the
chill from cold windows.
For cell phone users, charge your phone using a car adapter that hooks into
the cigarette lighter, instead of using the charger that plugs into a wall
outlet.
Retrofit incandescent light bulbs with energy efficient compact fluorescent
(CFL) light bulbs. Seventy percent of what comes off the 100-watt bulb is
heat, not light.
If possible, avoid using major household appliances (washer, dryer and oven=
)
during the peak periods of energy demand.
Install a clock thermostat. You can program it to keep the temperature
automatically set to 68 degrees or less when the house is occupied and,
health permitting, 55 degrees or off at night.
Turn down the water heater temperature to the ""warm"" setting or about 120
degrees, and try to avoid wasting hot water.
Use cold-water wash cycle for more loads of laundry.
An electric toothbrush does not need to be plugged in all the time, and wil=
l
remain charged for days after being unplugged.
Connect your PC, monitor, fax machine and computer ""peripherals"" to one
power strip, and then turn off that power strip when not in use and every
night.
Install separate switches for smaller areas. Often in large buildings,
dozens of lights are controlled by a single switch, and not all of them nee=
d
to be on. These lights can be rewired into smaller groups of lights on
independent switches. This way only those that are needed can be turned on.
Make sure warm-air registers, baseboard heaters, and radiators are not
blocked by furniture, carpeting, or drapes.
Switch off the ""drying"" cycle on your dishwasher.
Line dry your clothes instead of using a clothes dryer.
Reduce heating costs by closing a door to an unoccupied room or area that i=
s
isolated from the rest of the office or house.
Dust off light bulbs. Dirty, greasy, smoky light bulbs can reduce light
output by as much as 10 percent. You=01,ll avoid the tendency of switching =
to a
stronger bulb, which will use more energy.
Maintain the right temperature in your refrigerator and freezer.
Refrigerators can use up to 20% of the total electricity in your home. The
refrigerator should be set between 38=15F (3=15C) and 42=15F (6=15C). The f=
reezer
should be set between 0=15F (-31=15C) and 5=15F (-26=15C).
Clean the condenser coils at least twice a year. Dust and pet hair can buil=
d
up and cause the refrigerator motor to work harder. The coils are located o=
n
the bottom or the backside of most models.
Take a shower instead of a bath. The average bath uses twice as much hot
water as a five-minute shower.
Fax and copy only when really necessary. Sometimes we take advantage of
these common luxuries, but there was a day when we didn=01,t have them. If =
you
must make copies, make all you need in one batch, then turn the machine off
if you know it won=01,t be needed again soon.
Open freight doors only when needed. When trucks are actively being loaded
or unloaded, leave the doors open. As soon as the job is done, close the
doors to conserve energy.
Take the stairs; instead of the elevator. You=01,ll save energy and get a
little exercise to boot.
Turn your heater(s) down when you're using your fireplace, and don't forget
to close the damper when you're not using the fireplace.
Replace incandescent bulbs with fluorescent lamps, and save on approximatel=
y
30-38 percent of your lighting costs
Always wash full loads in the dishwasher and air-dry dishes on the ""energy
saver"" setting.
Shorten the pumping cycle on your outdoor pool and shift it to off-peak
demand times.
Enter and exit quickly. Every time an exterior door opens, a large amount o=
f
heat escapes, and cold air replaces it. Open outside doors as little as
possible, and when you do, do so quickly. You also can use this as an excus=
e
to send door-to-door solicitors on their way.
Switch off instant water heater in kitchen sink.
Circulate heated air. Since warm air rises, it tends to be trapped in the
highest areas of your home. A ceiling or portable fan running at a very low
speed can help distribute warm air more evenly and reduce the desire to tur=
n
the heat up.
Use task lighting. If you=01,re working diligently at a desk or workbench,
other light in the room could be turned off or dimmed.
Defrost food in the refrigerator. Instead of defrosting food on the counter
where it may spoil, or in the microwave where it will use extra energy,
place it in the refrigerator 24 hours before you need it. This will help
keep the temperature down in the refrigerator while it thaws.
Use microwaves for most cooking. A microwave does small and medium cooking
jobs more efficiently than an oven or range top. Follow a recipe for
suggested cooking time and don=01,t cook foods longer than needed.

Online ease and access are an empty promise in a flawed market. CLAMOR OVER 
THE recent market exit of Utility.com, billed as the world's first Internet 
utility, was a wake-up call for the energy industry. That failure, along with 
the energy debacle in California, raises questions about the viability of the 
Internet as a vehicle for retail energy sales, enrollments, and fulfillment 
in particular, and of electric and natural gas deregulation in general. 

In the United States, though nearly 40 million customers (90 percent of them 
residential) are eligible to choose their electric and/or gas supplier, more 
than 85 percent have remained with their incumbent utility distribution 
companies (UDCs). Of those who have switched, just 5 percent were residential 
customers, and fewer than 15 percent used the Internet for any part of the 
transaction. Another 10 million customers are expected to have choice by Jan. 
1. Odds are, however, that switching will remain limited despite widespread 
access to the Internet and online signups that can make choice a simple 
matter of point and click. The question is, why? 

The problem goes beyond the Internet to the very foundations of energy 
deregulation. At the root, it's a question of customer value. Independent 
power producers, energy service providers (ESPs), and the utilities 
themselves sold energy restructuring on its promise of lower costs for 
consumers. However, the track record of other deregulated industries reveals 
that the reverse is often true-particularly for mass-- market customers. 

Making retail choice meaningful for customers depends on amending the ground 
rules of deregulation. Though many needed initiatives lie in the hands of 
regulators, it may be that the players that can be most influential in 
spurring action are the utilities and ESPs whose brands and fortunes are at 
stake during this transition. 

WHY CUSTOMERS AREN'T BITING 

As I see it, five fundamental problems are hindering the successful 
transition to competitive retail energy markets. 

1. Risky Business. During regulation, when energy prices were cost-- based 
and fixed, UDCs generated supply to meet demand, up to capacity. Now many of 
the UDCs willingly have sold their generating assets and agreed to share the 
risk of price fluctuations. The result is an out-of-control wholesale market 
in which generators maximize profits by manipulating supply to drive up 
prices. UDCs and ESPs forced to buy on the wholesale spot market get killed 
when their retail price is fixed by contract. The result is that few ESPs are 
willing to risk taking title to wholesale energy for re-sale. Furthermore, 
the California Independent System Operator has evidence that the state's 
energy ""crisis"" actually arose not from increased demand, but from reduced 
supply. The reason, says the ISO, is that generating facilities have cut 
capacity from last year's levels for no apparent reason. 

Amidst such speculation, mass-- market customers are reluctant to switch from 
the ""safe haven"" of their incumbent utilities. 

2. Where's the Choice? Industries such as airlines and telecom demonstrate 
that deregulation leads to price discrimination, with different customers 
being offered different prices. As a result, ESPs compete hotly for large 
customers with large loads that allow them to be creative strategically, and 
still be profitable. On the other hand, residential and small commercial 
customers present such thin margins (especially with mandated ""price-to-beat"" 
offers and rate reductions from the utility) that ESPs cannot serve them 
profitably without automated enrollment and customer self-service processes. 
Few ESPs have focused on automating these processes, however. During the 
regulated era, utilities subsidized the cost of serving these small customers 
with the revenues earned from large accounts. Now it seems no one wants them. 

For example, Enron completely abandoned the California residential market 
just three months after it opened. In Pennsylvania, ESPs are ""dumping"" 
residential customers back to their incumbent utilities. ESPs in Ohio were 
forced to delay service to enrolled customers when their market support 
generation agreements with the incumbent utilities were not in place as 
expected. All of this heightens fears among customers that their chosen ESP 
will not be able to serve them or will vacate the market. Because they 
haven't been educated to the contrary, they fear they would be left without 
service or with some cost for switching to a new ESP or back to their 
utility. 

3. Online Liquidity Lacking. The much-touted retail auction exchanges are 
also struggling. One reason is that when customers compare bids in today's 
pricey market to last year's contract prices, they don't perceive any 
savings. Second, many commercial and industrial customers perceive no real 
price competition among retail suppliers for their contracts on an energy 
auction exchange. They believe they will get more competitive bids by 
preparing requests for proposal and soliciting bids directly from suppliers. 

4. Patchwork Regulation. Because regulation varies by state and transactions 
vary by utility, it is expensive and complex for ESPs to expand into 
different markets. For example, an ESP willing to offer a franchise deal to a 
national chain, say, McDonald's restaurants, may find it virtually impossible 
to navigate the regulations and transactional requirements for working with 
the many utilities in all the states where the chain operates. 

5. But Is That Rate Better? A customer who visits a popular retail energy 
website such as Essential.com or Energy.com may be presented with a standard 
offer price from one ESP. Is that a good price? How does it compare to what 
he pays now? Most massmarket energy customers don't know. Add the fact that 
65 percent of all Internet shoppers do not complete their purchase 
transactions, and the problem is clear. Price discovery must be enhanced, and 
the shopping and enrollment processes need to be simplified to attract novice 
energy buyers. 

A TO-DO LIST FOR BUILDING REAL CHOICE 

The challenges I describe are formidable; no one solution will address them 
all. Here are some important actions necessary to help break the logjam. 
Utilities and ESPs in particular can play a critical role in encouraging 
regulators at the state and federal levels to make needed changes. 

Cap Wholesale Prices. Energy companies are at the mercy of federal regulators 
to dampen wholesale market volatility. They, and state regulators, should 
continue pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider 
short-term regional price caps on wholesale electricity. To mitigate gaming 
of the markets, the FERC also should require generators to publish their 
annual plans for scheduled downtime, and force them to explain unplanned 
downtime. 

Form A Mega-Exchange. To promote liquidity in retail energy exchanges, the 
operators of the various exchanges should consider pooling their resources to 
develop a universal exchange portal-or at least a virtual exchange-that most 
or all of the largest customers could use. That way customers and suppliers 
could go to one site and see all deals, even if the deals were posted 
regionally behind the scenes. Such an exchange would offer various 
procurement vehicles, including auction, bid/ask, and standard offer. 
Suppliers also would welcome a single site where they could see all qualified 
deals. 

Educate the Public. Consumer education in deregulating markets clearly needs 
to go further. Regulators in these states could follow a strategy that's been 
moderately successful in several states: collecting money from all 
participating utilities and ESPs to launch a campaign to increase the 
public's understanding of retail choice. Radio, TV, and print ads would 
explain the merits of deregulation, demystifying the enrollment process and 
calming the fears of apprehensive customers. Through this type of program, 
for example, Pennsylvania regulators saw mass-- market awareness of retail 
electric choice soar to 94 percent in just over a year. Utilities and ESPs 
can enhance these public awareness efforts by coordinating their own 
educational materials with the statewide campaign. 

Redouble Marketing. In line with the objectives to increase consumer 
awareness, energy service providers need to do a better job of branding their 
service, communicating their value proposition, facilitating price discovery, 
and targeting the actual buyer within commercial organizations. This is a job 
for the professionals. ESPs should hire and consult with Madison Avenue 
talent to develop branding and advertising campaigns. ESP websites should 
allow a prospective customer to enter basic information from their utility 
bill, and calculate both the commodity charge and the distribution charge, 
demonstrating the clear impact of switching on one month's bill. Accuracy is 
critical. Often, the ESPs have difficulty getting this calculation right 
themselves. 

Standardize Transactions. Utilities and ESPs, backed by a FERC directive, 
should take the lead in developing national standards for electronic 
transactions, including switching. That would ease apprehension among 
customers, make national contracting easier, and reduce the investment 
required by energy suppliers to enter new markets. 

Phase out ""Standard Offers."" State regulators should consider speeding the 
elimination of UDC ""price to beat"" and ""standard offers."" This price rigging 
creates a false economy with the customer, adds undue price pressure to 
commodity prices, and puts severe earnings pressure on utilities. The crisis 
situation in California has made such potential consequences crystal dear. 

Aggregate the Apathetic. Some municipalities have begun aggregating their 
residents to form residential aggregation pools that are attractive to ESPs 
and wholesale suppliers. If the municipality successfully addresses customer 
apprehension, and allows disinterested customers to opt out, these 
aggregations can be an effective way to force choice in a community... at 
least until the next general election. Energy companies and state regulators 
may be able to encourage aggregations by educating local officials on the 
benefits of such buying pools and providing materials for marketing to 
residents. 

Force Choice. State regulators can force all customers to choose an ESP, 
and/or bar the incumbent utility from acting as an ESP. In Texas, for 
example, utilities cannot prospect for new energy supply customers outside 
their territory until at least 40 percent of their franchise customers have 
chosen an alternative ESP For gas deregulation in Georgia, all customers were 
assigned an ESP in proportion to the market share each ESP garnered in a 
pilot period. Energy companies may influence legislators in deregulating 
states, as well as federal legislators, to pursue this approach. 

Consider Re-Regulation. The FERC should consider guidelines to encourage 
states with volatile supply networks to re-regulate, or defer deregulation, 
until the wholesale markets stabilize and the bugs have been ironed out of 
the deregulation process. 

Simplify Rates. State regulators should encourage utilities to simplify their 
rates for residential and small commercial customers. That would allow retail 
suppliers and customers to more easily understand the rates and potential 
savings of switching to an ESP. 

Deregulation will succeed only when all stakeholders put the success of the 
program before partisan interests. Without the undivided support of all 
parties, there can be little improvement on the pseudo-competitive mire we 
see today. It just doesn't work.

Companies wish to deal directly with utilities and avoid helping state foot 
the bill. 
June 15, 2001 
By KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register 
California's business community is locked in a battle with energy regulators 
and lawmakers about how deregulation will ultimately pan out - and whether 
companies will be stuck paying most of the tab for the state's electricity 
crisis. 
Business groups want to continue down the road toward deregulation. They are 
lobbying politicians to pass legislation that would let companies buy 
electricity directly from power suppliers, bypassing the state's regulated 
utilities. 
""In our hearts, we still believe we can make this a competitive market and 
get some cost savings,'' said Bill Dombrowski, president of the California 
Retailers Association, which represents 9,000 stores in the state, including 
Home Depot, Target and Albertson's. 
But Gov. Gray Davis' foray into long-term contracts, agreeing to pay $43 
billion over 10 to 20 years for power, could squash that ambition. 
The state's Public Utilities Commission delayed a proposal June 7 to restrict 
companies from signing so-called ""direct access"" contracts with power 
providers. Regulators are expected to rule on the proposal next week. 
The debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to 
solve California's costly power crisis. 
It will determine whether businesses, with residential customers, pay for the 
bulk of the state's future energy purchases. It also could determine whether 
Southern California Edison, the state's cash-strapped No. 2 utility, will 
avoid bankruptcy - and whether deregulation will survive in any form. 
""The governor got it exactly wrong,'' said Peter Navarro, an economics 
professor at the University of California, Irvine, who is running for the San 
Diego City Council. ""The long-term contract strategy is a de facto 
re-regulation of the market because it eliminates the ability of industrial 
customers to bargain for a lower price.'' 
Direct access was a key component of the 1996 deregulation law, designed to 
break the monopoly of California's utilities. Under this concept, all 
customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated 
utility - just as they pick a long-distance phone company. 
Currently, 11,000 businesses and government entities have direct access, as 
well as about 77,000 residential customers - but some energy service 
providers, such as Enron Corp., are dropping their residential customers. 
Direct access is at the center of the latest Edison bailout plan, sponsored 
by Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek. Under the plan, the 
3,600 largest businesses would agree to pay $3.1 billion of Edison's debts 
over 15 years. In exchange, businesses would be allowed to secure their own 
power contracts by 2003. 
But energy regulators may not let companies off the hook at such a bargain 
price. 
David Gamson, an energy adviser to PUC Commissioner Geoffrey F. Brown, said 
regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system, the state will 
be stuck with too much electricity under long-term electricity contracts 
through 2021. That would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying 
the bulk of the $43 billion in future power costs. 
Complicating the issue is Wall Street. The state's bankers, led by J.P. 
Morgan, are nervous about selling as much as $13.4 billion in planned state 
bonds if businesses - now the largest ratepayers in the state after 
governments - find a way out of the system. The bonds are meant to repay the 
state for $8.2 billion in power-buying costs so far this year and to cover 
some future costs. 
Business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through 
a surcharge on their utility bills. If businesses are allowed to sign on with 
outside energy providers, that revenue stream would be in jeopardy. 
""We have companies now that want to get below-cost power from the state, but 
when the market turns, they want to leave,'' said Lawrence Lingbloom, chief 
policy adviser on energy to Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey. ""Remaining 
customers would be left with those costs, and it would create a death spiral 
for the revenue stream.'' 
Consumer groups oppose direct access because it would allow businesses to 
avoid paying most of the costs of the energy crisis. 
""Direct access is a policy that should be dead because it's a key adjunct to 
deregulation,'' said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights in Santa Monica. ""But right now, it's a policy that's driving all the 
deals.'' 
Even as regulators and consumer groups try to snuff out direct access, 
business groups are lobbying to save it - with the help of key legislators. 
Two bills, one sponsored by Bowen, who heads the Senate energy committee, and 
a second by Assemblyman Dave Kelley, R-Hemet, would rescind language in 
previous legislation that gave the Public Utilities Commission authority to 
block direct access. 
Both proposals would require businesses to pay the state an ""exit fee.'' 
Those fees haven't yet been determined, but they would include a surcharge or 
a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of 
future energy purchases. 
Companies say they don't want to pay. 
""Direct access has allowed businesses to enter fixed- price contracts to get 
stable rates,'' said Shawn Covell, senior manager for governmental affairs at 
Qualcomm Inc. in San Diego. ""It's really unfair when you have businesses that 
have taken their time to protect themselves, to punish them.'' 
Qualcomm, which makes telecommunications equipment, saw its energy bills 
double to $6 million last year. The company signed a contract with an energy 
service provider, Strategic Energy in Carlsbad, and capped its rates. 
Otherwise, Covell said, its electricity costs would have doubled again this 
year. 
Sweetwater Union High School District in Chula Vista is a direct-access 
customer. The district, with 35,000 students, spends about $2 million a year 
on energy, said Jim Clark, its energy manager. His district won a ""watchdog 
award'' for efficiency from the San Diego County Taxpayers' Association 
because it locked in lower rates. 
When Gov. Gray Davis announced in January that the state would begin signing 
long-term contracts, Clark extended the district's contract through 2006 at 
11 cents per kilowatt-hour - enabling it to save $1 million a year, he said. 
""As soon as Davis made the announcement, we knew the market was going to 
move,'' he said. ""The market only changes when people buy. When the state of 
California steps to the plate, the price goes to the moon.'' 
Davis has maintained that the long-term contracts between the state and power 
suppliers helped bring down high spot market prices in recent weeks by 
removing demand from that market. 
But Clark and others who want to go the direct-access route fear the 
government will force businesses to pay for all the costs of the energy 
crisis, including rate increases of 38 percent to 49 percent, plus surcharges 
to pay off $13.4 billion in forthcoming state bonds. 
""Businesses will be required to pay for the mistakes that the governor and 
the Legislature have made,'' he said. ""Who else is going to pay for it? 
Ultimately, it will fall on the heads of all consumers.'' 
Register staff writer Hanh Kim Quach contributed to this report. 

"
360,"To add to Scott's comments:

The average price of the contracts over 10 years are $69/Mwh, about
one-fourth of the average price the state had been paying.  Some of those
$69 contracts are locked in at that price and not subject to gas escalation.
The contract rates are also not adjusted for inflation, so the relative
price may drop over the contract term.

DWR predicts that the contracts will meet 70% of the state's overall needs
for the next 10 years.

About 25% of the state's purchases this month are on the spot market, down
from 100% earlier this year.

The state feels it has purchased all the ""around the clock"" power it needs,
but still has a need for more ""dispatchable"" power.  The strategy is to
leave some room to take advantage of a better market if it develops.

A question was asked about Reliant, presumably its 2 cent ""bring your own
gas"" offer (the questions were inaudible).  Freeman said Reliant failed to
respond rapidly enough to make good on its offer.

The current spot price is $121, which they admitted could go higher
depending on weather, etc.  The state is at less exposure, however,
according to Freeman, because only a quarter of the state's purchases will
now be on the spot market.

When asked about the length of the deals, Freeman said the state's only
leverage was to offer to buy power now into what he called an upcoming
""period of uncertainty.""  Otherwise, there was no reason for producers to
offer lower prices.

The contracts contain clauses that allow DWR to bring in its own gas if gas
prices are too high.  Freeman indicated that the state has a source
available but did not elaborate.

Freeman expects the public power authority to take an active role ""unlocking
the Path 15 bottleneck"" and that it will be completed within the lifetime of
the majority of contracts.

Freeman said the state is ""not out of the woods"" and that ""no one is
declaring victory or saying the crisis is over. ""  He said prices could once
again go through the roof occur unless FERC implements a ceiling.

Enron Says Open Grid Would Help California

     Enrons president says utilities outside California are not allowing
power to move freely into that state, aggravating the shortages that sent
power prices soaring this summer. Enron says that the Internet and
computer-based growth in the economy are pushing power demand far beyond
forecasts. Partly because it takes too long to grant approval for new power
plants, California doesn't have enough generation to meet the 14% increase
in
peak demand it experienced since 1996. Utilities that own the transmission
lines outside California are trying to preserve monopolies by hindering
national electricity sellers, like Enron, from moving power into the state.
Wholesale electricity prices surged to as much as 10 times last year's
average during hot weather in California this summer as a result of tight
supplies and growing demand. No significant power plants have been built in
the state in 10 years, and no additional supply is expected to go on line
until the middle of next year. Enron says that because federal energy
regulators have not issued rules to force utilities to open the grid, it is
very difficult to get access to transmission across the US. Enron says it
trades energy in seven regions of the world, and of all the markets where it
does business, the North American electricity market is the most screwed up."

The key to the energy proposal President Bush unveils today can be found on a 
wall in the three-room suite that houses his National Energy Policy 
Development Group, next door to the White House in the Eisenhower Executive 
Office Building. 
On the wall hangs a huge erasable board that serves as a giant checklist to 
guide the preparation of the administration's eight-chapter energy policy, 
which Bush formally unveils in Minnesota today. For each chapter, there's a 
check mark for two rough drafts, a peer review, a final draft, two more 
rounds of recommendations on the drafts, then graphics and photos. Toward the 
end of the checklist is an all-important box to check: ""Concurrence of the 
OVP.""
The OVP -- Office of the Vice President -- has driven every aspect of the 
energy report. No proposed recommendation has survived without the consent of 
one man: Vice President Cheney, the administration's indispensable man -- and 
chair of the energy task force. 
The release of the energy report shines a new spotlight on Cheney, a quiet 
conservative from Wyoming who has been given credit for running the show 
without annoying or upstaging his boss. The handling of the energy task force 
so far reflects Cheney's personality near perfectly: It is a closely held 
process with a high regard for the concerns of industry. This close 
involvement of Cheney is partially a strength, because the effort has been 
efficient and well-managed. 
But Cheney's strong role is also potentially the report's weakness. He is 
about to undergo a blast of unwanted scrutiny as critics seize on his 
finances and oil industry ties in an effort to discredit the policy. 
Democrats and environmental groups are charging that his judgment on energy 
matters is suspect because of his chairmanship until August of Halliburton 
Co., a Dallas-based energy services firm that is expected to benefit from 
several parts of President Bush's policy. Cheney, 60, made $36 million last 
year, most it in compensation from Halliburton, including salary and his 
exercise of stock options and sale of restricted stock. 
""He is seeing the problem entirely from the side of the energy producing 
industry that made him a millionaire, not from a consumer struggling to make 
ends meet,"" said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental 
Trust. 
An official close to Cheney called such suggestions ""an outrage,"" and said 
his expertise in the industry and knowledge of its technology were crucial to 
""trying to solve a problem of this magnitude."" 
Although the plan has extensive recommendations about using technology to 
conserve energy and produce power more cleanly, the heart of the report is 
its conclusion that the United States needs hundreds more power plants, 
natural gas pipelines, oil wells and nuclear reactors. 
Several administration officials acknowledged that Cheney had handed 
ammunition to his critics by declaring in a speech in Toronto on April 30 
that conservation ""may be a sign of personal virtue,"" but is not a sound 
basis for a comprehensive energy policy. 
""Given his background, he should've been real careful,"" said Sen. Charles E. 
Schumer (D-N.Y.), who has offered an alternative energy plan that he says 
focuses equally on supply and demand. ""I think they've had some real 
stumbles."" 
Sen. Craig Thomas (R), who succeeded Cheney as Wyoming's lone House member in 
1989, said he does not expect such criticism to rattle the circumspect 
Cheney. ""He'll just say, 'All right. That's the way it is, folks. I'm doing 
my job. Here's my plan,' "" Thomas said. 
As always when questions are asked about Cheney's influence, White House 
officials argue vigorously that the energy plan is Bush's plan. An official 
close to Bush said Cheney and other task force members had updated the 
president often since beginning their work on Jan. 29. ""At several critical 
decision points, the group has come to the president to ask him to make 
judgments and decisions,"" the official said. 
Cheney's directions are carried out by the task force's executive director, 
Andrew Lundquist, his deputy, Karen Knudsen, and four other staff members. 
Cheney also chairs the task force itself, which includes the secretaries of 
energy, interior, treasury, agriculture, commerce and transportation and the 
head of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Aides say Cheney met with only half a dozen of the interest groups seeking 
input into the policy, including Enron Corp., the Houston energy conglomerate 
that is a large and longtime Bush contributor, and the Edison Electric 
Institute, an energy trade group. Vance Meyer, a spokesman for Enron, said 
the firm's chairman, Kenneth Lay, and another executive had a 30-minute 
meeting with Cheney. Edison assembled 15 or 20 chief executives to meet with 
Cheney. 
But Lundquist and Knudsen, representing Cheney, met with half of the 400 or 
so groups -- industry, environmental, regulatory and academic -- that 
requested access. Exactly which groups the Cheney advisers met with is being 
kept secret by the White House. 
The task force's stealthy operation reflects Cheney's distaste for publicity. 
Following news reports about the private nature of the energy deliberations, 
Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Government Reform 
Committee requested information about the groups the task force met with. 
Cheney's counsel, David S. Addington, rebuffed the members of Congress, 
arguing that there was no legal requirement to comply with the request. 
In a seven-page response to the request, Lundquist wrote that the meetings 
""were simply forums to collect individual views rather than to bring a 
collective judgment to bear."" White House officials have declined to disclose 
the list of meetings or attendees. Aides said representatives at the meetings 
included 118 energy industry or corporate groups, 40 renewable energy 
providers, 22 unions, 13 environmental groups, five academics, 63 
governmental groups, six energy efficiency proponents and a consumer group. 
Environmentalists complain that the meetings reflected Cheney's 
predispositions. The vice president met with industry leaders, while 
dispatching aides to speak to environmentalists, several of which were 
grouped into one meeting. The meetings of 22 labor representatives, who 
gathered in groups, were publicized by the White House, but sessions with 
industry were not. 
Cheney, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told the Associated 
Press that he hasn't consulted with any officials from Halliburton and 
rejected the notion that the task force's work is compromised by his private 
meetings with industry officials who give money to the Republican Party. 
""Just because somebody makes a campaign contribution doesn't mean that they 
should be denied the opportunity to express their views to government 
officials,"" he said. 
Cheney chaired nine meetings of the Cabinet-level task force, mostly in his 
ceremonial office. Each of the meetings, attended by the task force members 
and aides, lasted 90 minutes, with Environmental Protection Agency 
Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and 
Bush economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey often reflecting different 
interests. 
For 20 minutes at the end of each session, Cheney told staffers to leave the 
room so the top officials could settle differences privately, without risk of 
the differences being leaked to the news media. In only a few cases did Bush 
have to resolve disputes among advisers, participants said. In most cases, 
Cheney was able discreetly to broker agreement among the Cabinet members.

Dolphin to Invite Companies for $4 Bln Gas Project, Paper Says
2001-05-17 03:00 (New York)


     Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, May 17 (Bloomberg) --
Dolphin Energy Ltd. of the United Arab Emirates will invite
companies to pre-qualify this month for a $4 billion project
to build the Middle East's first cross-border gas pipeline
network, Al-Hayat said.
     Dolphin, in which U.S.'s Enron Corp. and France's
TotalFinaElf SA share a 49 percent stake, will ask
for designs and quotes May 19-23 for most stages of the
network, from the delivery of gas from Qatar's offshore North
field to its final destination in Dubai, the paper said.
     The network includes a 2-billion cubic-feet-per-day gas
-processing plant in Qatar, a 220-mile sub-sea pipeline from
Qatar to Abu Dhabi, and an overland pipeline from
Abu Dhabi to Dubai, the paper said, citing a Dolphin statement.
The first delivery via the network will be in 2005.
     Qatar, which owns the world's third-largest gas reserves, and
the U.A.E. want the network to form the core of a
regional grid to power electricity and water-desalination
plants, as well as gas-based industries, for decades to come.

UK: ANALYSIS-Spanish boom spurs wave of new power plants.
By Margaret Orgill

05/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - Electricity companies are flocking to build dozens 
of new power stations in Spain, attracted by surging energy demand and a 
looming shortfall in local electricity supplies. 
Spanish and foreign firms have proposed around 40 new gas-fired power 
stations although not all will go ahead, delegates heard at an energy 
conference in Madrid.
""How many of these projects get realised depends on the permitting 
process...and the capacity of the gas system,"" Agustin Llana, manager for gas 
and power at Shell Espana told the conference. 
Spain urgently needs the new power stations or it could face a crisis similar 
to that in California where power prices rocketed and the state suffered 
rolling blackouts, say analysts. 
Electricity demand has grown by 30 percent since the early 1990s while new 
generating capacity has risen just five percent. 
""If we look at new capacity needs, Spain needs between 1,000 and 1,500 MW a 
year at least,"" said Pedro Larrea, vice president of energy management at 
utility Endesa. 
Spain does not have any gas-fired generation at present and the lure of a 
lucrative ""dash to gas"" has prompted ambitious expansion plans by local 
utilities, who have until now relied on hydro, nuclear and coal, and ventures 
by independent power producers (IPPs). 
The new proposed combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power stations have a 
capacity of around 30 gigawatts and would raise Spain's existing capacity by 
two thirds if they all go ahead. 
FOREIGN NEW ENTRANTS LINE UP 
Of this total, more than 14 GW is proposed by large Spanish power utilities 
with around 10 GW from IPPs and the remaining four GW from other local 
companies. 
Industry experts say many projects will not get off the drawing board and 
only six to eight GW of capacity will in fact be built by 2004/2005. 
Spain is opening its electricity market to competition in line with a trend 
in the European Union. Fifty five percent of the sector is liberalised and 
the government plans full deregulation in 2003. 
Endesa and the other leading Spanish utility Iberdrola have 80 percent of the 
generation market between them with the rest divided between Union Fenosa and 
Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico. 
New entrants include Intergen, a joint venture between Shell and engineering 
firm Bechtel, and U.S. utilities Edison Mission Energy and Enron Corp. 
LOCAL UTILITIES START BUILDING POWER STATIONS 
Local companies are ahead in the permitting process which can take up to two 
years and involves getting over 20 local and national licences. 
Endesa, for example, has started building work on a 1,200 MW power station 
whereas no IPPs are believed to have begun building. 
""(Most) applications are from electricity utilities. We are in the queue but 
way down,"" said Erik Gustafson, manager of business development at Intergen 
which has plans to build a 1,200 MW plant at Catadau in Valencia. 
The main problems facing IPPs like Intergen are obtaining gas supplies, the 
linking of gas prices to oil rather than to electricity and government delays 
in issuing new gas transport terms, he told the conference. 
Spain has no gas supplies of its own and while the monopoly of Gas Natural, 
controlled by Repsol has been ended by the government, new entrants have been 
slow to make inroads into the market. 
""Financing depends on gas. The real key is whether the gas market can become 
more liquid,"" said Gustafson. 
Another worry for IPPs are Gas Natural's ambitions to move into generation 
with plans announced to build 4,400 MW capacity which could restrict gas 
supplies for new entrants. 
""If Gas Natural have 4,400 MW up and running, they will go to the top of the 
list and get all the (gas) capacity. We will be stuck in Valencia without any 
gas,"" said Gustafson. 
Spain's natural gas demand is expected to double to 35 billion cubic metres a 
year by 2010, with most of the growth from 2005 onwards from power generation.

Middle East flame burns ever brighter as exports hot up

05/17/2001
Lloyd's List International

Exports of LNG from the Middle East - Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Oman - leapt 55% 
in 2000, climbing to 17.1m tonnes from 11.1m the previous year. 
Oman became the world's 12th LNG export nation during the year, despatching 
shipments to South Korea, the US, Japan and Spain.
The Middle East now accounts for 17% of all LNG exports, a percentage which 
will continue to grow in the years ahead. 
Not only are deliveries under long-term contracts with Japan and South Korea 
building toward plateau but also new purchase deals have been struck with 
India and negotiations are underway with a wide mix of potential customers. 
In March a third Qatari LNG company - Ras Laffan LNG Company 2 (Rasgas 2) - 
was established to supply gas to India. 
Rasgas 2 has signed a deal with Petronet of India to provide 7.5m tonnes of 
LNG per annum (mta) for a period of 25 years, commencing in late 2003. 
Two-thirds of the gas will be shipped to a new import terminal at Dahej in 
Gujarat state and the remaining third to Cochin in Kerala. 
Plans for a similar agreement with another Indian company, Dakshin Bharat 
Energy Consortium, are moving ahead. 
This calls for delivery of 2.6 mta to India for 25 years, also from 2003. 
Rasgas 2 will build two LNG production trains, each of 4.7 mta capacity, at 
its Ras Laffan complex to meet the bulk of this new Indian commitment. 
These trains, which will be the world's largest, will be constructed 
alongside the two 3.3 mta LNG trains by the original RasGas company. 
Rasgas 2 will be owned 70% by Qatar Petroleum and 30% by ExxonMobil, but the 
equity split will be slightly at a later stage to allow for taking a 5% 
share. 
Qatar has come a long way since the other LNG company, Qatargas, launthe 
country on to the world LNG stage in 1997 with its first shipment to Japan. 
Even after the Petronet deal - the world's largest LNG sale - there are no 
plans to ease back on developments. 
Last month Qatar announced it would sign a one-off deal with Spain for the 
sale of up to 1.5m tonnes of LNG. 
The Gulf emirate is also talking to Lebanon, France, Italy, China and Taiwan 
about the the possibility of export contracts that would total 12 mta. 
Qatar's LNG exports utilise gas from the offshore North Field, the world's 
largest single source of non-associated gas. 
In April 2000 Oman loaded its first cargo at the new Qalhat terminal - a 
shipment for South Korea. Oman LNG has contracts to supply Japanese and South 
Korean customers with 4.8 mta of LNG for 25 years, and has finalised a deal 
to provide 1.6 mta for India's Dabhol project. 
In addition, 17 cargoes are being delivered to Spain over a 14-month period 
ending in December 2001 under a one-off agreement. 
Several spot cargoes have also been shipped to the US, an activity which is 
likely to continue. 
Deliveries to Dabhol, for use in a combined cycle power plant, were due to 
commence at the end of 2001, but the project has run into difficulties due to 
a dispute over electricity pricing the state of and Enron, the developer of 
the power plant and LNG import terminal. 
This could jeopardise this facility - the largest gas-fired power plant in 
the world - and is the only dark cloud on what is otherwise an bright horizon 
for Middle East LNG.The future is bright: Qatar became the fourth largest 
exporter of LNG in 2000.

Enron Joins Alberta's Natural Gas Exchange

05/16/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

CALGARY -(Dow Jones)- A battle for better representation of natural gas 
trades on Alberta's primary electronic exchange has been resolved between NGX 
Canada Inc. and Enron Canada Corp. 
Enron, a subsidiary of of Houston-based Enron Corp. (ENE) and the largest 
natural gas marketer in Alberta, will start entering real-time data into 
NGX's system by August, expanding the exchange's database to a more realistic 
one, spokesman Eric Thode told Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday.
In turn, the marketing giant has withdrawn a C$101 million law suit against 
the Alberta exchange, and two other electronic trading companies claiming 
that NGX skewed price indexes by using only that exchange's data, and caused 
Enron to lose millions of dollars. 
""We felt that NGX was not giving a true picture of the Alberta gas market and 
that had a monetary impact on trade indices,"" Thode said. 
Enron sells approximately 7 billion cubic feet to 7.5 Bcf a day of Alberta 
gas compared to an average 1.5 Bcf a day traded on NGX. 
The marketer will trade data from its EnronOnline daily spot, one-month spot 
and bid-week spot gas transactions with NGX, starting in August once the two 
houses implement the necessary system adjustments. Industry will receive a 
30-day notice of the market change. 
Including Enron's data will substantially improve the quality of NGX's 
indexes, said president Peter Krenkel. 
""The more data that is in the index computation, the more representative the 
index is of the market and then more comfortable clients are in using it to 
settle contracts,"" Krenkel said. 
The exchange, a subsidiary of OM Gruppen AB of Sweden, an international 
exchange operator, had been restricted to deals conducted on NGX after buying 
Canadian Enerdata Ltd.'s day, month and bid-week spot gas price indexes last 
September, he explained. 
Now NGX will include Enron's immediate, real-time transactions off of data 
feeds between EnronOnline and the Alberta exchange. Enron clients will have 
the option to trade on either or both exchanges, Krenkel said. 
The Alberta exchange will compute the index from all data received on a 
weighted-average basis. 
Traders in Calgary, seat of the Canadian natural gas industry, were 
encouraged to hear Enron's transactions and volumes will flow straight into 
the NGX system because of concerns the marketer would not provide immediate 
volumes. 
""I just want to make sure we see where the real-time volumes are,"" one trader 
said. ""The more trades we get in, the better for a better-weighted index."" 
An independent auditor hired by NGX will monitor the system on a regular 
basis for irregular trading activities.

that, if we haven't talked to him yet.  Let me know and also if you have his

389,"Greetings and Happy New Year to you both.

Eve:  Has the sub-group met since things were put on hold a few weeks ago?  
If so, I'm very interested in hearing about what's going on.  If the group is 
going to meet between now and the 16th, I'm also very interested in 
participating in those meetings.  Delaney, I'll be attending the meeting on 
the 16th.  The Angelides proposal has certainly spiced things up--just what 
we need, more David Freeman.......

Best to you and yours in the New Year.
Jeff



"
390,"It might be a good idea to have a conference call to discuss the state 
treasurer's proposal released last Friday.  A summary is attached.  If folks 
agree that a call would be useful, does Noon PST (on Monday) work?

Best,
Jeff
"
391,"One thing:  remember we are ""cautiously"" optimistic.  That qualifier is 
extremely important, given the lunacy that's underway in California.

392,"This case is killing me!  1) I had to get before 10 AM today.  2) So much for 
that leisurely 2-hour coffee and morning paper at the neighborhood cafe"

at three--count 'em, three--games of cowboy."

398,"Great.  Glad to hear Sue picked it up.  I'll touch base with her.

Best,
Jeff"
399,"FYI:  Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key 
outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis. The 
administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC 
and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via 
utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.  They were shooting for this 
Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now 
looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week"
400,"Here's one that's ""final,"" not draft, that just came out.  I'm assuming that 
this is the one the press is refering to.  Let me know that you think.
"
401,"C1 was up 10 points today.  I figure that means you signed a deal with them
yesterday...."
402,"Thanks very much.  Greatly appreciated. In response:

--I'm going to stick with 7 units.  Just don't have the time to take on another course.  But appreciate the info and the suggestion.

--I have a backup for Deals.

Thanks again so much for the info.

Jeff

"
403,"Well, that's not helpful. Won't make things any easier.  Are they an ARM member?

I'll let the large customer groups know.

Best,
Jeff

"
404,"I'd like to fax you something that Edison sent in support of their argument that:

1) by virture of the PX credit framework, DA customers contributed to Edison's undercollection, and,
2) DA customers should therefore contribute to the recovery of the undercollection.

Could I get your fax numbers?  Would like to get your comments once you've reviewed the argument.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff"
405,"Doesn't this constitute a change in Edison's position, i.e., I thought they'd indicated that everyone would be paid by end of Q1'03.  Now it appears they're saying that suppliers will get paid by year-end '03.  Am I missing something?  Thanks for the info.

Best,
Jeff

"
406,"You getting these?  You care?

"
407,"Were you on call this morning?  It was pretty interesting.  If you weren't on, I'd like to discuss a couple of topics that came up.

Best,
Jeff

 "
408,"That's fine.  Not critical.  Jeff

 "
409,"Need to think about it a bit.  Here's some of what we know based on the settlement:

Total debt = 6.35 B
After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to.
The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM.

Out-of-State Prospects
These out-of-state prospects say they are considering Texas:

DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 265, 4.7, Shreveport Evangel (UT, LSU)
WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 195, 4.4, Champaign, Ill. (UT, Ill, Mich, Mia, Colo,
MSU)

DT Loren Howard, 6-4, 270, 4.8, Scottsdale, Az. (ND, UT, Stan, UCLA, ASU, Neb)

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns still have 12 commitments, and I think they will get another
one Sunday when outstanding DE Chase Pittman attends church services at
Shreveport Evangel.
It is a tradition at Evangel that recruits announce their college plans to
the congregation.
Pittman might commit to LSU instead of Texas, but I think he is going to be a
Longhorn.
He and his parents were in Austin over the weekend and participated in
pre-game ceremonies honoring the memory of his brother, Cole, who was killed
in a traffic accident in February while returning to UT for spring football
practice.
He visited LSU the previous week and has narrowed his choices to the
Longhorns and Bayou Bengals.
While Pittman was not on an official visit (he and his parents paid their own
way), his teammate, speedy DB Jonathan Wade, 5-11, 185, 4.3, was on an
official visit.
Wade, a 10.3 sprinter, committed to Tennessee several weeks ago, but he must
be having second thoughts. He says he remains firmly committede to the
Volunteers, but you know what I have always said about kids who keep on
visiting after they commit.
In case you are a new subscriber, I say that is akin to keeping on dating
after you become engaged, which makes marriage rather doubtful.
WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill., has not made it to a Texas game, as he
had planned to do, but he says the Longhorns still are his No. 1 choice.
He does say he has changed his mind about committing early and wants to look
around a little.
LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is the closest thing I've seen  this year
to super Longhorn freshman Derrick Johnson.
He told me Sunday he probably will announce his college choice right after he
attends the Texas-Oklahoma game.
He leans the Longhorns' way pretty strongly, but I think he might swing the
other way if the Sooners win that game.
""I really like Texas, but I want to see how those teams look when they play
each other,"" he said.
If the Longhorns can sign Smith and Aaron Harris, the stud middle backer at
North Mesquite, they will be a lot better at linebacker in future years when
they team with the young guys already on campus.

Big 12 Roundup

Top five powers Oklahoma and Texas square off in Dallas Saturday in the Big
12 Conference headliner this week, but two other big games also are on tap.
Kansas State, a one-point loser to Oklahoma last week, hosts dangerous
Colorado, and Iowa State travels to Nebraska in a battle of unbeaten teams.
The Texas-Oklahoma scrap will go a long way toward deciding the Southern
Division winner.
In the Northern Division, perennial power Kansas State must defeat Colorado
to keep its title hopes alive.

Buckman Down to Horns, Heels
Brad Buckman, the 6-8 Austin Westlake forward who is ranked among the
nation's top 50 basketball recruits, took his official visit to UT last
weekend.
He visited North Carolina and Kansas earlier, and his mother told me those
are the only three schools he has been considering.
She also said he has eliminated Kansas and probably will choose between Texas
and North Carolina in the next couple of weeks.

Junior Basketball Classes Loaded

While there are several top senior stars in the boys' and girls' ranks this
year, there are four junior girls and two junior boys who are ranked among
the nation's top players already.
In fact, Beaumont Ozen's 6-11 Kendrick Perkins was picked as the No. 3
recruit in the country, regardless of class, on one national list, and some
people think 6-10 Ndudi Ebi of Houston Westbury Christian, is just as good.
The Longhorns are recruiting both of them, along with about everybody else in
the country.
The nation's top junior girl is 6-3 center Tiffany Jackson of Dallas Lincoln.
Kalee Carey, a 6-5 center at Class 4A power Canyon; Destiny Drew, a 6-2
center-forward at Corsby, and Emily Niemann, a 6-1 forward at Houston
Westbury Christian, also are drawing a lot of national attention.
Carey's father is a graduate of the UT Law School and Niemann's parents are
both Texas grads.
All four girls are considering Texas, but they also are being recruited by
many other top schools.

 Brown Says Longhorns Should Be Very Good
Offensively with Chance for Stout Defense, Too

Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns will head into the football season with
just one problem on offense and fewer than expected on defense if his young
tackles come through.
In an interview with coach Brown last week, I asked him how the Longhorns
compare with his best teams at North Carolina.
In a nutshell, he said Texas is better offensively than those North Carolina
teams, but is not quite as imposing defensively
His last two teams at North Carolina lost only to Florida State, posting the
best two-year record ever for the Tar Heels, and finishing in the top 10
twice, something Texas hasn't accomplished once in nearly two decades.
""Our offensive line is better here,"" he said. ""We have two quarterbacks who
can play. We had that at North Carolina, too, but our upside is better here.
Our receivers at North Carolina were very good, but the ones we have now can
be the best we've had.""
He said North Carolina's fullback and tight end  from his last team there are
still playing in the NFL, but he also noted that UT TE's Bo Scaife and Brock
Edwards, who are only sophomores in eligibility, have NFL potential, too.
He said one big plus offensively at UT is the depth the incoming freshmen
will provide in the line.
""We had good offensive linemen at North Carolina, but we had trouble finding
good ones in numbers,"" he said.
""We didn't have good numbers here and had to force some guys to play too
early,"" he said, ""but that got them ready to play and now we have  good
experience and good numbers and we hope we can start redshirting our freshmen
offensive linemen. We need to get to that point.""
Hesaid the only problem he sees offensively this season is at tailback, and
that isn't as big a problem as it seems because all five of the returnees
competing for the job are competent players and several of them have the
ability to step it up.
And if they don't step it up, there is a young fellow coming to two-a-days in
August who has everyone excited. I've written enough about Cedric Benson that
I won't go through it all again, but he is something special.
If you doubt it, just remember this: Three state championship games in Class
5A at Midland Lee, with five touchdowns in each game. No one else has ever
come close to doing that once in Class 5A much less three times.
Defensively, Brown has high expectations and that's only natural because 10
of the starters and 5 of the backups on his 1997 North Carolina team were NFL
draft picks. Three of his defensive linemen went in the first round.
But he says the Longhorns have some talent on defense and could be very good
if his young tackles come through.
The departures of two-time All-American Casey Hampton and his equally
formidable sidekick Shaun Rogers left a giant hole in the middle of the
Longhorn defense.
They were the run-stoppers deluxe who led a unit that ranked 12th nationally
in rushing defense, yielding 94 yards a game last year.
Eight starters return from a Longhorn defense that also ranked seventh in the
nation in total defense, yielding only 278.3 yards per game.
Brown also said Rogers, who missed several games with a badly sprained ankle
was never close to 100% last year after being injured early in the season.
""Shaun was one of the best players of his size I have seen at rushing the
passer,"" he said. ""When we lost him, it really hurt our pass rush.""
I have speculated in previous issues that the Longhorns probably will have a
better pass rush from their front four this season because sophomore-to-be
Marcus Tubbs got 5.5 sacks, second on the team last year, while standing in
for Rogers, and because the defensive ends are a year older and there is more
speed at tackle than before.
Brown said the coaches are counting on a better pass rush from their linemen
""Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton have the potential to be as good as anybody
at defense end,"" he said. ""We have high expectations for them.'
At tackle, he said Tubbs ""weighs 285 and he can run. He's got a great upside.
He's a young guy who has played well already and should just get better and
better. We're excited about him.""
Brown also said the move of Maurice Gordon from end to tackle ""looks like a
good one. He runs a 4.6 and he looked really good this spring. We just need
him to keep on working hard and he'll be a  good one. He's already a good
pass rusher, and he's working on getting stronger to stop the run.
While Gordon is a pass-rushing whiz, the likely starter at tackle opposite
Tubbs is redshirt freshman Stevie Lee if he is able to recover fully from
foot surgery.
Lee played well last year in spots as a true freshman, but was injured early
and was able to get a medical redshirt year, which means he is a freshman
again this year.
If Lee is healthy, Brown said the key for him is off-season conditioning
work. ""Stevie can play at about 300 pounds, but he doesn't need to play at
330,"" he said.
""In this league, everybody spreads people out, forcing the front four to make
off-schedule plays. You can't just be a run stopper anymore. You've got to be
quick enough to make adjustments.
""We're emphasizing speed and quickness,"" he added. ""That's why we made some
moves in the spring, like moving Maurice Gordon to tackle, O. J. McClintock
to end (from linebacker) and Lee Jackson to linebacker (from safety).""
Brown also said sophomore Adam Doiron, who also played well in relief last
season as a true freshman, has a bright future at tackle.
""He needs to get get stronger,"" Brown said. He's real smart and real tough.
He just needs to get more experience and use the off-season program to get
stronger.""
He likes his secondary, saying, ""I feel like we are in real good shape with
our secondary. We have guys who have the ability to cover and the speed to
make up ground. We also are two deep in the secondary for the first time
since we've been here.""
The area where he wants to see the most improvement on defense is a
linebacker, where all three starters return.
""We have asked our linebackers to step it up,"" he said. ""They have played
really well for us, but we want them to just take an extra step to get even
better.""
The Longhorns had troubles with their place kicking in the spring, and Brown
said the returnees and three walk-ons will compete for the starting job when
two-a-days begin in early August.
Summing up, he said the Longhorns' strengths are at quarterback, wide
receiver, tight end, the offensive line, the defensive ends and the secondary.
He said defensive tackle will be a strong position, too, if Lee returns
healthy and all the young players continue to improve.
When asked to comment on the most pleasant surprises from spring training,
Brown said, ""Bo Scaife returning and looking like he is ready to play is one.
Kyle Shanahan (a walk-on wide receiver) did some really good things. Derrick
Dockery finally being healthy again was a big positive development.""
He said all of the ""spin-down"" moves the coaches made on defense this spring
are ""looking good at this point. We wanted to improve our speed on defense,
and these moves have helped us accomplish that.""
Asked about the biggest disappointment in the spring drills, he said, ""It was
nobody emerging at tailback. They all played good, but, after Ricky Williams
and Hodges Mitchell, our expectations are very high.""
True Orange Observations
Look for the Longhorns to use more one-back formations this season. Why? The
back-up wide receivers and tight ends are more dangerous than the fullbacks.
WR Sloan Thomas and TE Brock Edwards would start and star for many teams, but
they are backups at Texas.
Also, look for a lot more misdirection plays and other plays designed to make
the offense less predictable than it was last season.
* * * *
With coach Mack Brown's first great class of recruits heading into their
third seasons, and two other great classes following it, this is the season
the Longhorns should be able to finish in the top 10 for the first time since
1983.
For those of you who seem to get a little impatient at times, it is worth
noting that the Longhorns have finished in the top 20 just seven times since
1983 and three of those seven times were in Brown's first three years here -
15th in 1998, 21st in 1999 and 12th in 2000.
This Longhorn team probably will start out about fifth or sixth in the
country and it should be able to stay in the top 10 unless some wheels fall
off.
The great thing about the way Brown has built this program is that he and his
assistants recruit great prospects every year, and develop them.
I think this year will start a long string of years for UT  to be contending
for high national honors.
The only way you can win the highest national honor - a national championship
- is to get to the championship game.
Since only two teams get to the championship game, some very deserving teams
are left out. Miami and Washington, for example, were certainly deserving
last year, but unbeaten Oklahoma and once-beaten Florida State got the nod.
So, having an outstanding team doesn't guarantee a berth in the national
title game.
I won't predict the Longhorns will wind up in the Rose Bowl playing for the
national title this year, but I will predict that Brown will have us playing
in a national championship game very soon.
Teams in the Big 12 and SEC have the extra burden of having to play a
post-season game for their conference titles, which means they have to play
two godzillas back to back to be No. 1.
But great teams can do it and Texas will be a great team in the very near
future. It might not be this year, but it could be if things break the
Longhorns' way.

418,"Mike,
We need to know the volumes of their load and how it is broken down.  This would include location (by zone), ramp rates, and load factors.  Also, we need to know how fast the load can react to instructions, and how flexible the load is, i.e. can the load be moved up and down on an interval basis without causing problems?  We would also need to know their load forecast.  For example, when is the load available to be reduced, summers, on-peak, etc.?  Obviously if this is limited, we would want to value it accordingly.

Thanks,

423,"Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and 
Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your 
earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.

 1.  The downstream contract number for Aquila Marketing and a ""scheduled quantity report"" for the Pooling contract WH034, this is the report you would obtain from the pipeline at the end of each cycle to determine cuts etc. or you can give me the user id and password 
  and I can go pull it myself.

  The EPGT's IT group is trying to research the correct DUNS # for Aquila Dallas Marketing.  If this issue is not resolved, I am planning on setting up a meeting with EL Paso on November 26th at 1:30 at their offices and I would like for you to go with me. We will meet with their IT and Business Group for about an hour or so.  
Your prompt attention to this will be greatly appreciated.






     Thank you.

	HPL quoted us $0.025 from Katy on the Marathon Refinery

	Gary talked to Exxon and Tejas about sourcing gas into
	Crosstex (was CC Transmission) at Banquette.  Exxon 
	apparently sells their equity gas at the tailgate of King Ranch

Per Southern Union's confirmation sheet, the 15,000 mmbtus spot deal on days 03/25 & 3/26 should be priced at  HSC GDP DA +.05 ( at Tuesday, 3/27/01 pricing- which was $ 5.235). Currently, Sitara is showing a price of  HSC GDP +.05.

 Is this Tuesday pricing correct?  If so, pls forward this to Daren so that he can change the price in Sitara to $ 5.235 +.05 ( Totaling $5.285).

Mark Walker will send a request to Germany for their availability data.  Mark 
will also provide the definitions of Machine availability.  The contractual 
availability is what was included in the memo I handed you when you were in 
my office on Wednesday.  If you need an electronic copy of that  document 
Mark can send it to you.

With respect to making us responsible (as the coordinator) for obtaining the 
Germany availability data:  We have no leverage over our European 
counterparts and cannot compel them to provide this data on a 1 day notice.  
I want to avoid setting expectations that are clearly beyond our control.  We 
will, however, give it a shot. 

I did notice the European data stops in Sep 01 so we need 6 months to fill in 
all the gaps.  Has Becky been unable to obtain any more recent data or is 
this the most current info you have?

Thanks,
Hollis

N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin

Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to 
Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 
325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the 
rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold 
between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. 

The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the 
industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate 
plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's 
project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin 
for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 
2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. 

Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and 
Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston 
Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. 

The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with 
direct access to several local distribution companies, including 
Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, 
People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, 
NGPL, Northern and Vector. 

The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year 
demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering 
""mileage-sensitive rates,"" which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor 
supply access and optimize transportation value. 

Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14. 
For more information, contact project director Paul Miller in Omaha, NB, at 
(402) 398-7758 or James Hoff in Denver at (303) 575-6475, or see the 
pipeline's Web site at www.northernborderpartners.com. "
495,"Karen, I'm sending you down some hand written notes.  If others want, please 
call and I'll get them to you.   We need to look at the letter we sent to Wis 
Gas on flow control and conform this to match as much as possible.    MK

the discussion we had yesterday on automating the request for service

the verbiage a customer sees before he clicks on a parcel of capacity, and 
with a couple of minor limitations on the capacity we sell (i.e., no Subpart 
B-restricted 311 capacity parcels) Northern will be able to treat a 
customer's click on a parcel of capacity as submission of a request for 
service.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

of course, they can't transact with ena.
"
532,"Great - look forward to seeing you (bring a picture!).

"
533,"I work with Louis Dicarlo in Ed McMicahels group.  

Louis gave me some Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG) deals to research and he suggested that I talk to you if I have any questions.

According to Louis, when NNG did a deal with ENA, the deal would be booked under the counter party name RISKMANTRA.  It appears that deal number NK7775.1 is a swap between NNG and ENA.  I spoke to Morgan Gottsponer at NNG last week and he said he was hedging some of the NNG storage positions.  I've pulled the confirmation for this deal out of the zip file attachment so you can see it.  Unless you object, I'm going to ask risk management to change the counter party to RISKMANTRA in tagg.  

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.  I have some other items that deal with NNG and Enron Compression Services that I may ask you questions about but I'm still doing my research.

Thanks.

549,"The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

should plan to leave the office no later than 3:00.  Will this work or do we
need to leave earlier?"

Attached are two letters to Hutchison and Gramm dealing with  RR retirement bill   All you have to do is print them out, sign them and  put a stamp and address on an envelope and then mail them.  Please do  this...we are down to the wire on this bill.  Remember  that it in no  way means any money out of your pocket...just would allow railroaders to retire  at age 60 rather than 62 and make more money available to widowers/widows.   Darnell
 
p.s. last time I will ask you for help on this.

554,"I think it will be a very close game.  Except for the fart against Colorado,  
you just don't bet against the Aggies at Kyle Field.  OU is obviously a very 
good team.  But I think more importantly, they are just playing great 
football.  They make plays when they need them, and I know it sounds like 
sour grapes, but frankly, they are also getting lucky.  When the QB heaves a 
pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a TD week after week, 
the football Gods are smiling on you big time.  But regardless, you've got to 
admire Stoops and the job he has done.  They have proven for three 
consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best 
defenses in the country.  

And as far as the Horns are concerned, I still think they are just an above 
average team.  They have beaten no one of any (and I mean any) significance.  
They were completely outclassed against the one (albeit right now, the best 
team in the country) good team they have played.  And lost to a bad Stanford 
team.  But the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may 
result in a T+1 win.  But right now, I think the Aggies have a better team.  
But if they start thinking about aTM, they will lose to both Tech and KU.  
They are not good enough to play poorly and win against decent competition.

565,"Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). "

582,"Hey Guz, just wanted to write and say hello and see how things are going
with you.  Things down here are going good.  I put my two weeks in with my
company last week and I am starting my new job on FDeb 12th.  It is with a
company called Arcade planet, which is an Internet Gaming and Coin Operated
company.  The position is an Internet Advertising sales position. There will
be travel to New York, Chicago, LA and Vegas in the future once I learn what
the heck I am doing so I am totally excited about that.  I went snowboarding
on sat and that was a blast.  I am trying to take advantage of being back in
this area again.  I am hoping to get up there at least three or four more
times before the season ends.
Things with Ricky and I are good.  He sent me an incredible email that wiped
me off of my feet last week and so at least I know now that he is still
totally and fully into the relationship that we have.  It is hard to tell
when he is there and I am here of what is really going on between the two of
us.  His plan is to move out here in Dec. when he finishes school so I guess
we will just wait and see what happens in the next 10 months until then.
Hope all is well with you.
I would love to hear from you again to catch up!!
Lots of love, little woody!

583,"Two very important things for Sunday and Monday.

On Sunday beginning HE 1through HE15 PST we have 10 mws of length for 
Wheelabrator (Martel) in NP-15.  We need to sell this length to another SC, 
increase our gen schedule (if necessary) and enter the SC to SC trade in 
CAPS.  Put a purchase from Wheelabrator in under ST-Whourly and a sale to the 
other SC also under ST-Whourly.  Prices should be flat in Enpower initially, 
then call Chris Foster and see what he wants to do with the margin (likely 
$10-20 for our marketing efforts).

On Monday beginning HE1 through HE 24 PST we have a shaped schedule parked 
with PNM at PV.  Our basis for this energy is $129 off peak, and $179 on 
peak.  My hope is to get this energy to the NW off peak (a wheel or maybe a 
buy/resale with LDWP or MID--call with questions) or import and sell it in 
SP-15.  We are already long in Enpower (#506291), and should make all the 
sales under the ST-SW book(tranny, buy-resales, etc...).  The mw schedule is 
as follows.

HE 1-6 23 MWs
HE 7-15 45 MWs
HE 16  40 MWs
HE 17  35 MWs
HE 18  25 MWs
HE19-22 45 MWs
HE23-24 53 MWs

IF you have any questions please give me a call.
Thanks and good luck!

585,"Group-

I have spent the day working with Kathy at EPE to correct the models for last 
week.  Every day from 17th through 20th (so far) has had formula errors.  
There is absolutely no excuse for this.  Check the formulas to ensure they 
are correct before emailing it to EPE every day.  It is an easy thing to fix 
and failure to so makes us look bad.

586,"Group,

Our discussion forum notes as a group are significantly improved in the past 
3 weeks in many areas.  I believe communication in the group at shift changes 
is improving and is quite good in general.  However, there is always room for 
more improvement.  Specifically, other traders in the group and on the floor 
would benefit from more detailed information regarding outages.  Please try 
to include the reason for a plant derate as well as the ETR when a unit is 
lost.  I would also highly recommend notifying the cash desk in the region 
affected by the outage, either by email or verbally.  An important outage was 
recently missed by both the real-time group and another cash desk on the 
floor.  Real-time had ready access to the information concerning the outage 
but did not pass that information on to others in the group at the shift 
change or others on the floor.  In this case, such poor communication simply 
made us look foolish.  We work hard for (and justly deserve) the solid 
reputation we have on the floor.  Let's make sure we do the little things to 
maintain it. 

Again, keep up the good work.

I didn't invite Dave just to spite him because I'm immature like that :)
When we started seeing eachother again, the whole seeing other people was
left up in the air.  But it was made clear that neither of us would like it
if we found out the other person was dating someone else.  And we could not
sleep with anybody else by any means!  But it's become more strict and very
evident that neither of us even want to see anybody else.  I just have my
guard up right now.  So even though we are basically back together, I don't
want to make it official.  I'm still letting him stir.

601,"Hey Katie, I am just getting off work here in a few minutes and thought i 
would drop you a line.  I am doing good.  I am sorry I missed your call on 
Saturday night.  I was at home and in bed by 9:30.  I went out until 3 am on 
Friday night and then Rick and I went skiing on Saturday morning and left at 
6:30 am.   We were skiing until 7pm up at Meadows so by the time I got home I 
just went straight to bed I was soooo exhausted.  Skiing was awesome however, 
and I did really well as I went and had my skis tuned.  What a difference 
that made.  While I was waiting for them to be tuned I ended up buying new 
skis, boots and poles.  I can't wait to try them out!  Anyway, things are 
going good for me.  I am a little depressed however as today is my Dads 
birthday. Also Cita is back in the hospital again.  She had another heart 
failure.  She is doing better though.   I am leaving tommorow morning to 
spend the rest of the week with my sister/visit Cita and then I am going to 
Vegas on Saturday with Jay, Jimmy, Caitlin, Nicole and a few other people.  I 
am excited to go and in a way it is kind of a deal for my dad as he loved to 
go to Vegas for his birthday and the Super bowl weekend.  Anyway, I better 
run.  I work tonight so email me back so I have something to read for the 
night shift.  How is everything with you?  "
602,"hey Mark,
yes, cita had another episode of congestive heart failure.    I'm pretty
sure that they just need to increase the dosage of her CHF medicine since
it was a fairly mild attack.    The good thing was that she noticed her
condition quickly and actually called 911 herself.   They also took her off
an IV within an hour.   We hope that she'll be out of the hospital by
Tuesday but won't know until we talk to the doctor this morning.

I'm leaving to Houston on Tuesday and return on Friday late afternoon.
So, I will not be able to go skiing on Friday.    For Saturday, I
tentatively have a golf date scheduled with Cicero and the Richardson's.
Bob was trying to schedule a few foursomes but will not know until today.
We call it the Superbowl of Golf but actually turns out to be the
Superduffers.    If you are interested in playing, I'll see if he has an
opening for another golfer and you can play in my foursome.

If golf falls through, a day in Big Bear sounds good if the ski conditions
are good.    I'll need to drive up and back the same day.   Karen cannot go
because she is recuperating from her lasik eye surgery and cannot do any
strenuous exercise for a couple weeks.     We can check the weather and
conditions later in the week.

If golf and skiing fall through, then I might take Karen to a museum on
Saturday.    She's been wanting to see a special Egyptian tour that is
actually in Santa Ana through February.   You are welcome to join us if
interested in Egyptology.

No real plans for the superbowl, other that maybe a gathering at my place
and possibly doing the HB 10k run in the morning along the pier.     I'm
not too interested in the game itself but we'd be remiss not to have at
least a small gathering.   So, plan on that if nothing else comes up.

I will not have email access during my trip to Houston.....  so leave
voicemails instead during the next week.
see ya,
Dave

603,"We will be offering Derivatives I training on-site.  If you are interested in 
attending, please let Amy FitzPatrick know no later than May 21st.

Derivatives I - Applied Energy Derivatives
Presented by Paradigm Strategy Group

Date:    Monday, June 4th and Tuesday, June 5th
Time:  8:00 am to 5:00 pm

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical 
understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that 
are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how 
financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management 
needs of clients.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; 
its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration 
disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines 
that are characteristic of energy prices.
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward 
curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and 
transportation.
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of 
price curves and their components.
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship 
between basis and transportation/transmission.
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, 
explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various 
customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. 
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more 
favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using 
embedded options.
Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing 
implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum 
prices, etc.

606,Hey a few of us are going to grab some drinks after work wanna come?
607,"Bill, during HE 17  IID had a 130 MW  Firm in the scrape and in the model.  
When checking out with IID they stated they had 120 MW only.  In speaking 
with Joe at  IID they stated that  they spoke with Tony at 14:13 PST and told 
him to put in 120 for HE 17 and 18 MST.  I agreed to check out with their 
number as it appears that there was a miscommunication between IID, Tony,  
and David (who was working during that shift).  You may want to ask Tony when 
he comes in if he recalls this conversation.  Thank you for your attention to 
this matter. "
608,"Dude I have to work New Years Day.  I was sure we were going to get ganked 
and end up in the Holiday Bowl.  I would have definetly been able to go to 
that.   I am fucking pissed.  Anyway, I might still go to the Holiday Bowl 
and root for Texas."
609,"Yo baby whats up?  Thanks for hanging out with me on Monday night.  I had a 
really good time (even if you were preoccupied with the Dave thing).  I hope 
all is going well for you.  I am actually working a day shift which is pretty 
cool because there is a lot less to do on the day shifts.  So, what do you 
have going for the rest of the week?  I have a work function tonight.  One of 
my friends is moving to the Calgary office so we are all going for beers at 
the Lucky Lab in southeast.    I got a call from my date from hell.  
Aparently I told her last week that we could grab a movie tonight.  I don't 
want to go so I think I am just going to tell her that this work thing is 
going to last too late.  Anyway how is your grandmother doing?   Are you 
excited about your party this weekend?  I went and bought a couple dress 
shirts and a tie for my christmas party at Nordstrom yesterday and ended up 
spending $184 !  Just on two shirts and a tie.  I should just refrain from 
even going to that store.  Check ya later sweetie!"
610,"Whats up lil' Kirky.  Don't worry about getting cut off I figured your phone 
just died or something.  I am so excited to come down there and hang out in 
the city.  I haven't hung out in the City since turning 21 and would love to 
go check things out.  That would be awesome if you could come into town on 
Wednesday or Thursday night.  Maybe we could grab dinner and some drinks.  I 
called your brother last night and left a message telling him that I was 
going to be in town.  Hopefully he isn't mad at me for all the assing out I 
did the weekend of Wilsons wedding.  I think my body is still recovering from 
all those shenanigans.  Anyway I will give you a call or email you early next 
week and let you know what our plan is for Wednesday and Thursday.  Look 
forward to seeing ya sweetie. Take Care!"
611,So.........
612,"Sounds like a blast.  My work thing was fun.  I broke my sobreity and got 
really drunk, went home and passed out at 8pm.  I was totally loaded.  It was 
very fun though. My interviews went awesome yesterday.  I think I will get 
that job.   So what do you have planned for the weekend?  Anything exciting?"
613,Do you want me to have him call you even if I don't go out with them?
614,"We have not heard back from Carla about her jury duty and whether it will 
continue through tommorow.  Therefore could you inform your group to continue 
sending the deal correction e mails to me until further notice.  Thank you 
for your attention to this matter."
615,The deal 411762 has been changed. Thank you 
616,"Uh I fucked up and sent this to myself instead of you.  
"
617,"Yeah dude I bet you got a lot of operational management and statistical 
business analysis as well as spreadsheet work with that Poli Sci degree.  At 
least the group projects will enable you to meet some people.  Are you still 
thinking about getting a job tending bar or something or do you think you 
won't have enough time?  good to hear you are coming up in a few weeks.  I 
would definetly like to go out with you guys on Thursday night. That Friday 
night i already have plans but maybe we can go play some golf on Friday 
afternoon.  I played in a tournament with some people at work out at the 
Reserve last week.  Boy is that a great course.  Our tee time was at 7:30 and 
we had all been out partying until 2am the night before.  So needless to say 
we weren't feeling so great come tee time. However the beers were free for 
the tournament and come about 7:45 we were drinking again and feeling a 
little better.  We all played really well and got fourth plance out of 42 
teams.  We won these sweater vests, a sand wedge, and a Nike bag.  There was

623,"F/y/i -- The proposed Enron media position on the LNG vessel fire incident is 
set forth as an attachment below.  Enron PR is anticipating (and in fact may 
have received) a question or two from the international shipping press re the 
incident as it is well known in LNG and shipping circles that Enron recently 
signed a timecharter for the service of this vessel.  

We're still gathering info re the incident (the shipowner appears to be 
cooperating fully but still has significant access restrictions due to the 
pending investigation) and will relay any relevant info we receive.  We have 
asked for a copy of any official incident report when it is available.  To 
date, we have not received any communications regarding potential involvement 
in a claim.  Although it is always possible that we could be named, we are 
confirming with maritime counsel that our exposure under maritime and tort 
law in connection with this incident is slight, if any, as we had no 
involvement in or control over the shipyard operations and the vessel had not 
been delivered into service for Enron at the time of the incident. 

Stay tuned for more as things develop.

Kind regards,
Dan
"
624,"I agree with Milly's comments and concerns in his attached e-mail.

A few points:

1.  I would send a clarifying memo, and would speak specifically to Diane 
Seib and Peggy Hedstom to ensure for the time being that all physical and 
financial power transactions receive legal review.  This does not mean that 
Linda/Sharon have to document all of them, rather we can still leave it up to 
documentation where appropriate.  But a lawyer needs to review all power 
confirms for the time being (physical and financial) to make sure that the 
product is being properly defined.

2.  In terms of power product definition, Milly has raised valid concerns 
which warrant legal review, which are market opening risk, change in market 
rules between now and market opening, and the size of the transactions being 
entered into.  There is also the inherent risks of the PPA, in essence 
interrutible risk.  All these risks need to managed at the front end.  i.e. 
Once a deal is executed by the trader, the lawyer cannot fix it after the 
fact.  Although the power traders or originators should already understand 
these risks for the product when they are transacting, please meet with 
Davies and Zufferli ASAP to ensure that they are cognizant of these risks 
when they are transacting.

3.  Please check our corporate resolutions to make sure that they cover off 
execution of confirms for power transactions in a similar fashion to gas 
transactions (i.e.  anything over a year must be signed by Milly, if it is 
less than a year it can be signed by Zufferli as the responsible trader or 
Davies as the responsible originator).  I note, however, for the time being, 
at least until the market opens, Milly wants to see all power trades 
regardless of tenor.

Peter.

625,"You've summarized things nicely and I think the ultimate P/L assessment will

Europe May Need 69,000 MW by 2005; What Generation Mix Will the Continent
Use to Reach that Goal?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five
years may prompt the need for an additional 69,000 MW of generating capacity
to be built, according to a new report from Financial Times Energy. The
additional capacity includes the proposed capacity for Spain through 2004,
but also includes Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
At the same time, concerns about supply and demand in Europe are being
exacerbated by Germany's plan to reduce its reliance on nuclear power.

ANALYSIS: If FT Energy's projections for necessary generation additions
in Europe are accurate, I think there are some real challenges that the
Continent will face in reaching this goal. First off, for perspective,
let's be clear on the amount of generating capacity that FT Energy is claiming
Europe will need by 2005. The figure of 69,000 MW is roughly equivalent
to the generating capacity in the state of California or the ERCOT system
in Texas. When we consider also that the United States consumes about double
the amount of power that Europe consumes, the projection that Europe will
need an additional 69,000 MW of new generating capacity is a staggering
proposition.

Granted, like other developed areas of the world, Europe's energy consumption
has grown over the last two years. According to data included in its report,
FT Energy claims that demand for power in Europe has risen from 2,409 
terrawatt-hours
(TWh) in 1998 to 2,446 TWh in 1999, an increase of about 1.5 percent per
year. While this may seem like a minimal increase, it is important to note
that in some European markets growth has exceeded that average. For instance,
estimated new capacity additions through 2005 are mainly concentrated in
Spain, France, Germany and Sweden. The growth in demand, coupled with market
liberalization, has created many opportunities in Europe for the construction
or purchase of generation assets.

Although reportedly 60 percent of the electricity market across Europe
has been liberalized to date, the Continent remains rather disjointed as
it is composed of 16 national markets that are all approaching privatization
at different speeds. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands began their
privatization movements in the early 1990s. Spain required its state-owned
utility companies to begin divesting their assets in February 1999, a process
that will continue through 2007. Germany decided to open 100 percent of
its market all at once in April 1998. And France resisted efforts to 
privatize,
and only began to liberalize its market under pressure from the European
Union. Consequently, although Europe may in fact need the 69,000 MW of
new generating capacity that FT Energy has projected, the type and extent
to which new generating capacity will be built in Europe will depend on
the energy policy of each independent nation. A variety of restrictions
may be found that will limit the opportunities to generate this huge amount
of capacity.

Each European country is developing its own policy toward privatization
and, by extension, its approach to generation development. I can't examine
the policy of each country in this forum, but I think a look at Germany
is warranted, both because it is a major component of Europe's total energy
market and because Germany poses some interesting dilemmas that will impact
the Continent as a whole.

Germany has largely been considered the crown jewel of European deregulation,
due to the fact that the totality of the German market has been opened
to competition. It follows that generation coming from Germany should 
contribute
a large percentage of the Continent's future power needs. However, a large
percentage of Germany's power has come from nuclear power, but that has
all changed over the last year. After the Social Democratic Party formed
a coalition with the antinuclear Green Party, nuclear energy became an
unacceptable energy source. The German government has essentially put a
moratorium on nuclear power, and in fact decided to eventually shut down
19 nuclear power plants in the country. Just last month, Germany's two
largest power producers, RWE AG and E.ON AG, announced plans to cut output
from their nuclear plants as a reaction to the squeeze on prices that has
developed since Germany liberalized its market. The measures amount to
a reduction of about 10 percent in Germany's overall power generating 
capacity.


Moreover, nuclear energy has generated over one-third of Germany's nearly
500 billion kilowatt-hours of annual electricity demand, and one-third
of Western Europe's total electricity supply. As the future of nuclear
power in Germany looks rather dim, big questions surround what will replace
nuclear as a power source in this country that is critical to Europe's
energy industry.

Coal currently produces about 50 percent of the power generation in Germany,
but as a result of the country's attempts to lower emissions, coal also
appears to be on a decline. Also, in Germany, as in the rest of Europe,
coal-industry subsidies will come to an end as early as 2005, making it
less economical to invest in coal-fired plants. At the same time, other
countries like France are exploring clean-coal technologies, but it is
questionable how much this production will contribute to the overall demand
across the Continent.

Generally, natural gas has been considered the ascending fuel that will
take the place of nuclear power in Europe, given the seemingly abundant
supplies of natural gas in Russia and the North Sea. However, as demand
across other continents such as Asia and Africa also increases, this may
impact the prospects of securing natural gas in Europe. In addition, there
are no effective rules across Europe for third-party access to private
pipeline grids, also putting into question the future of natural-gas supplies.
Also, as we have seen in the United States, as demand for natural gas 
increases,
so will the prices, which could impact the viability of natural gas a primary
power source.

As a result, much of the attention in Europe has turned toward renewable
energy. In fact, the German government wants to double renewable energy
output to 10 percent of total energy demand by 2010, using such forms as
hydroelectric and wind power. This seems consistent with what the rest
of Europe is doing. The United Kingdom also said that it wants to generate
10 percent of its electricity from renewable resources by 2010. Scandinavian
countries already have become predominantly based in renewable and 
low-emission
forms of energy, with hydroelectric power comprising more than half of
the Nordic region's total electricity production.

Wind power in particular is being given a great deal of attention in Western
Europe, with projects in Germany, Denmark and Spain ranking among the 
fastest-growing
in the world. Again, according to the U.S. DOE, wind power is projected
to grow by 1.9 percent per year in Western Europe. This growth prospective
is pretty dismal, and casts doubt on whether or not renewable energy will
be sufficient to meet the demand in Europe. Renewable energy works fine
when planning overall energy needs, but it rarely can be relied on to meet
peak demand. The laws of nature ensure that wind blows when it wants to
and the sun shines when it wants to, which can make peak planning based
on renewable energy difficult if not impossible. This being the case, many
critics say Europe's current move toward renewable energy is completely
unrealistic, arguing that it would take nearly 2,000 wind turbines to equal
one nuclear plant. In addition, the growth for renewable energy is plotted
over the course of ten to fifteen years. FT Energy marks the year 2005
as the point at which Europe will need the additional 69,000 MW of generating
capacity.

In addition, despite the fact that coal-fired generation poses pollution
problems, it is still a comparatively low-cost form of generation. This
will make it difficult for renewable energy sources to emerge in the absence
of a strong worldwide commitment. The U.S. Department of Energy projects
only a moderate increase in hydroelectric and other renewable forms of
energy through 2020, just enough for renewable energy sources to maintain
a slim 8-percent share of the total world energy consumption.

So what is the answer to this contradiction between the apparent need for
new generating capacity in Europe and the restrictions on power sources
that could help the Continent to reach its supply needs? First, keep in
mind that I've focused on Germany because it plays such a pivotal role
in Europe as a whole. However, the restrictions on nuclear power are not
necessarily indicative of the approach of other European countries. For
instance, the neighboring Czech Republic is embracing nuclear power by
opening a plant in Temelin. The question is, without Germany's contribution
of nuclear power, will Europe be able to derive enough capacity from other
power sources and other countries? Although the 69,000 MW goal seems very
ambitious, Europe as a whole may get closer to this goal through the use
of merchant plants. As competition continues, wholesale power buyers are
demanding shorter-term contracts, which in turn is supporting a growing
trend toward merchant plants throughout the Continent. Presently, only
the United Kingdom has moved aggressively to merchant power, but there
are signs that the trend is extending to Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
and even Germany. In addition to compensating for the move away from nuclear
power, merchant plants could also support a renewed growth of Europe's
natural-gas market. Yet, as we have seen in California, the plant siting
process offers its own array of regulatory hurdles, and it is not clear
if European governments will facilitate plant siting in various countries.
Plus, the merchant plants that are being discussed are all primarily 
natural-gas
fired, which again raises risks of relying so heavily on one power source.

Moreover, just as North America enters what could be a very volatile winter
due to our own brand of energy supply problems, we are finding that the
problem is not limited to our part of the world. It is, of course, unknown
if Europe will meet its additional supply projections of 69,000 MW by 2005.
Yet, at the same time, it is clear that demand on the Continent continues
to rise while traditional forms of power supply are on the decline.

627,"For the purposes of implementing physical power masters with counterparties 
to buy and sell power in Alberta, please find attached the final forms of the 
following documents, which collectively comprise our Canadianized version of 
the EEI master and incorporate comments received from Elizabeth, Peter, Chris 
and Mark Powell:

1.  Cover Sheet (which contains notification information, credit elections 
and our specific amendments to the form of base contract)
2.  Base contract (which constitutes the actual agreement)
3.  Schedules (which describe the Products and set forth the form of 
confirmation letter and the forms of guarantees)

The idea is that there are no changes made to the actual form of the base 
contract.  Instead, any changes to the terms of the base contract are made 
through amendments contained in the cover sheet.  The enclosed form of cover 
sheet contains our preferred amendments and credit elections.

I would ask that Rob Hemstock review the description of the ""Firm (LD)"" 
product.  You will see that I have created a general description of ""Firm 
(LD)"" and then gone on to describe what it means specifically for the Alberta 
market.  Rob, this description is contained in Schedule P of the attached 
""Schedules"" document.  Rob, please let me know if you have any comments on 
the Alberta specific description.

As it is still unclear as to how the documentation will evolve for trading 
physical power in Ontario, please be advised that we are still developing the 
appropriate product descriptions for Ontario, so for the time being we should 
probably not be using this document in Ontario.  If there is a counterparty 
that wishes to use it in Ontario, please contact Chris Gaffney to discuss 
same.

Dianne, the form of confirmation letter included in the ""Schedules"" document 
is the form that we should be setting up in your system.

Bill, the credit provisions contained in these documents are now basically 
identical to those in the EEI form in use by EPMI in the US, so there 
shouldn't be any real issues with the documentation from a credit perspective.

Finally, I wanted to reiterate that the process for putting this physical 
power master in place with counterparties is identical to that undertaken 
with the gas master.  In other words, (i) the commercial person who wants the 
master put in place will contact the credit department and provide them with 
the counterparty details, (ii) the credit department will prepare a credit 
worksheet and send it to the Calgary legal group, (iii) the legal group will 
prepare the master based upon the credit worksheet and forward it to the 
commercial person for review, and (iv) the commercial person will review and 
initial the master and return it to legal who will send it out to the 
counterparty for execution.  Milnthorp will then execute the master once we 
get the executed copy back from the counterparty.

Thanks,
Greg

628,"Attached is language which can be included in transactions involving power 
trades (physical or financial) which provides for the following:

1. Alberta market opening condition in favour of Enron Canada for January 1, 
2001; and
2. after market opening, provision for suspension of obligations in case 
there is a legislative or regulatory event affecting the Sundance ""B"" PPA 
which materially adversely impacts our ability to dispatch or sell the power 
of the Sundance ""B"" PPA.

There is, of course, some risk that counterparties will want these provisions 
to be bi-lateral, which could introduce the ability for the counterparty to 
use these concepts to avoid the transaction if, for example, the market moves 
against them.

Fed's McDonough sees global strains from slowdown.
Reuters English News Service - May 4, 2001

NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of New York President
William McDonough said on Thursday the international financial system is
showing some signs of strain from a slowdown in global growth.

McDonough, in remarks prepared for delivery to a banking group in Frankfurt,
Germany, said there is no broad agreement on how to handle international
financial crises.

""During the latter part of the 1990s, the international financial system has
endured perhaps its greatest stress in the post-war period, and currently we
again are seeing signs of strain associated with the global slowdown in
growth,"" McDonough said in a text of his speech released in advance.

The New York Fed chief did not comment further on the global economy or
discuss the U.S. economy in the speech, which focused on global financial
stability. McDonough is also chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision which recently completed a new accord on bank capital standards.

There is a broad consensus on the need to strengthen financial institutions
at the national and international level in order to create more crisis
resistant economies, McDonough said. But there is no comparable degree of
consensus on how to best handle international financial crises once they do
erupt.

""In particular, there is unease that the current approach to crisis
management that has evolved out of the experiences in Mexico and Asia,
notwithstanding its successes in some cases, entails solutions that are
potentially too costly,"" he said.

Critics feel the solutions entailed repeated reliance on large-scale support
packages, introduced adverse incentives, or moral hazard, and were in
themselves a source of uncertainty and potential instability, McDonough
added.

He advocated a flexible case-by-case approach to crisis management, adding
that regulators should strive for minimalist intervention.

The role of regulators is not to limit banks opportunities for growth and
profit. ""At the same time, if we encourage responsible behavior, we must not
create the illusion that we will rescue every institution that does not
succeed,"" he said.


McDonough Advocates Flexible Approach To Prevent, Cope With Financial Crises

BNA - May 4, 2001
By Jeffrey Goldfarb

A flexible, case-by-case approach, with minimal intervention by regulators,
is the best way to prevent and cope with financial crises, said William
McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and
chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

Speaking May 3 in Frankfurt, Germany, McDonough said bank supervisors around
the world should be working to enable banks to better manage their
businesses and their risks. ""At the same time, if we are to encourage
responsible behavior, we must not create the illusion that we will rescue
every institution that does not succeed,"" he said.

McDonough said that disclosure practices by banks, although improved over
the past decade, have not kept up with the many changes in the way they
manage their risk. He recommended that banks rethink what they consider
proprietary information.

""It is critical to approach the question of disclosure as users of financial
statements,"" he said. ""Shareholders, creditors and counterparties cannot
understand the risks of their own exposures to a bank until they first
understand that bank's appetite for risk and its approach to, and
methodologies for, managing risk. What should drive this debate is market
participants' need for information to make sound and secure credit and
investment decisions, rather than the concerns some have about what was once
considered secret.""

Amidst his remarks, an advance text of which was released in New York,
McDonough briefly commented on the state of the global economy, saying there
are some unfavorable signals. ""During the latter part of the 1990s, the
international financial system has endured perhaps its greatest stress in
the post-war period, and currently we again are seeing signs of strain
associated with the global slowdown in growth,"" he said.

McDonough explained that the solutions to recent crises in Mexico and Asia,
even though successful, may have led to certain currently held tenets that
are too costly, introduce adverse incentives or moral hazards, and are in
themselves a source of uncertainty and potential instability.

""But the alternatives,"" he said, ""look even more unpalatable in their
implications. Notwithstanding considerable efforts at the public and private
level to search for a better way, no magic bullet formula has been found.
Nor is one likely to be available.""

In essence, McDonough said, the quest for some broad, universal solution to
financial crises is a Pollyannalike pursuit. ""If history is any guide,"" he
said, ""new developments in markets and practices quickly will render
obsolete those measures that might seem well attuned to today's
circumstances.""

For that reason, McDonough encouraged a ""supremely tactical"" and creative
case-by-case approach to handling crises.

He specifically argued against standstill solutions, which suspend debt
service, usually in conjunction with the imposition of capital controls.
McDonough said that approach, in his opinion, could make investors skittish
and make it harder to generate support for honoring contractual commitments.
Standstills also undermine market discipline of and ownership by the local
authorities, he said.

""To sum up, I believe the one size fits all disposition inherent in the
standstills approach risks making situations much worse than they need to
be,"" he said. ""The only thing that strikes me as predictable under such an
approach would be that market access would be harmed across the board. Just
as bailouts may encourage too much risk taking, efforts to orchestrate
preemptive bail-ins may encourage too little.""


Gramm Says Changed Markets Demand Dramatic Review, Reform of Securities Laws

BNA - May 4, 2001
By Rachel Witmer

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm (R-Texas) said May 3 that the
changes in the U.S. securities markets since the 1930s, and especially in
the last 10 years, demand a ""dramatic review and reform"" of securities
regulation.

Gramm had previously announced his intention to conduct a top-to-bottom
review all of the securities laws with the intention of modernizing them.

Speaking at a meeting of the Security Traders Association, Gramm said that
the review will be open-ended, and that he will not prejudge the conclusions
from the effort. The senator said that the question he asks in looking at
laws and regulations is ""Are the benefits of this regulation in the market
as it exists today worth what we're paying for them?""

In addition, he emphasized that there will continue to be ""dramatic"" change
in the markets and said, ""I want the change to be dictated by the markets
and not the government."" One change that he suggested might come ""in the
long run"" is that securities markets, per se, could become a thing of the
past. ""I'm not certain that markets are not obsolete,"" he said.

Later in his remarks, Gramm clarified his statement, saying ""I don't know if
markets make sense any more."" He made an analogy between markets and
traditional book stores, which have serious competition from online book
stores. ""The Internet has revolutionized the book market,"" Gramm said. He
then asked, ""Is a centralized market necessary?""


NYSE's Survival

At another point in his remarks, Gramm suggested that as all-electronic
markets are proliferating and changing competition in the securities
markets, the New York Stock Exchange's ""survival is not guaranteed.""

In other comments, Gramm emphasized that while he may refer an individual to
the White House for consideration as a potential nominee for the
chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission, ""the president is
going to name the chairman and not me."" Asked about the length of time it is
taking for the White House to nominate someone for that position, Gramm
said, ""I don't see that any great harm is coming from it.""

Gramm told reporters after his remarks that he hoped the administration will
nominate someone who was ""knowledgeable, open-minded and free market.""
Finding all those qualities on one person is ""hard,"" he said.

On the topic of decimals, Gramm said that he did not see the recent
decimalization of the securities markets as a ""fundamental reform."" As of
April 9, all securities are priced and traded in decimals instead of
fractions. While on the House side there is some interest in exploring the
effects of decimalization, Gramm said ""I don't see anything in it now that
would induce me to want to go back and hold hearings about it.""


Lack of banking safeguards in HK
Financial Times - May 4, 2001
By Joe Leahy

Hong Kong lacks many of the formal safeguards in place in the UK and
Australia to protect banking consumers, said a study yesterday by the
territory's de facto central bank, Joe Leahy reports from Hong Kong.

Hong Kong has no general competition law, no regulator with an explicit
mandate for protecting banking consumers and no ombudsman scheme to process
complaints, the consultative study by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) found.

""As the Hong Kong market is becoming more sophisticated and more
competitive, and as consumer issues are coming more to the fore, it is
timely to consider whether the current arrangements in Hong Kong remain
appropriate,"" it said. .

Despite its pro-business bias, Hong Kong has been forced to re-examine the
issue of depositor protection following moves to deregulate the banking
sector.


Japan 'risks slide into downward spiral'
Financial Times - May 4, 2001
By Gillian Tett

Falling exports to Asia and the US and the fragility of its banking system
mean Japan risks sliding into a downward spiral with severe regional
consequences for trade, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development warned yesterday in its latest half-yearly report.

The OECD report says Japan may need to bail out the banks, a move the
government has ruled out.

The report comes at a critical time for the new government of Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi. The Paris-based think-tank attracts considerable respect
in Japan, and Mr. Koizumi is due to make his inaugural speech to parliament
on Monday, in which he will set out the government's economic policy.

The OECD report asserts that the level of bad loans is probably larger than
the government admits, meaning that some banks may not have sufficient
capital to write off their bad debts. ""In some cases, (realistic write-offs)
might even wipe out the capital altogether, requiring banks to reduce the
scale of their operations, raise capital in the market or seek public
financial support,"" it says.

The condition of the banking system is likely to be a key focus of Mr.
Koizumi's speech. He has pledged to introduce measures to clear out the bad
loans rapidly, under pressure from countries such as the US. The government
insists the banks have sufficient capital to complete this task.

""Public funds should be injected only when the financial system faces a
crisis,"" Hakuo Yanagisawa, financial reform minister, said recently. Some
Y7,450bn (Dollars 61bn) of public funds were injected into the largest banks
in 1999.

But many analysts and diplomats fear that without government help the banks
will be too weak to write off their bad loans rapidly.

The mountain of bad loans has damaged corporate confidence and left the
financial sector reluctant to lend.

However, forcing banks to cut their loans to unviable borrowers could lead
to more bankruptcies and rising unemployment in the short term, the OECD
admits. ""Managing the loan clean-up will be a huge task for the authorities,
in particular as flagging confidence may dictate that it will have to be
carried out in a short period of time,"" it says.

The timing of the clean-up is unfortunate, since Japan is suffering the
knock-on effects of the slowdown in the rest of the global economy, through
lower exports.

The OECD suggests that if more funds are injected into the banks, that the
bank managers should be sacked and the shareholders should not be rescued.
However, any fresh injections of public funds could trigger strong public
protest. It could also fuel Japan's spiraling debt burden which is projected
to hit 158 per cent of GDP in 2006 - and 138 per cent next year.

The OECD calculates the government will need to tighten fiscal policy by 10
percentage points of GDP by 2010 simply to stabilise the debt.

This is currently equivalent to Y55,000bn, a sum exceeding total central
government tax revenue. On current growth trends, tax revenue would
therefore need to be doubled if the adjustment occurred on the tax side
alone.

The OECD added that monetary policy would need to be highly supportive. It
expects to see 1 per cent growth in calendar 2001 and 1.1 per cent growth
next year, higher than many analysts are projecting.


Accounting Shift Lifts Deutsche Profits
American Banker - May 4, 2001

FRANKFURT- Deutsche Bank AG, Europe's largest bank, said Thursday that
first-quarter earnings rose 7%, fueled by lower taxes and a new accounting
rule for derivatives, even as revenue from investment banking declined.

Net income climbed to $920 million, or $1.68 a share. The results included a
gain of $208 million from the accounting change.

Chief executive Rolf Breuer is trying to reduce Deutsche Bank's reliance on
investment banking and emphasize businesses such as fund management and
consumer banking. Rivals in the securities business, including Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., reported lower profit in the first quarter. Deutsche Bank said
its investment banking revenue declined 1%.

Another rival reported a similar expectation. ""I expect to see growth from
asset management and personal banking this year7 said Helmut Hipper, who
helps manage about $53.4 billion at Union Invest GmbH in Frankfurt.
""Investment banking won't be the main driver.""

Deutsche Bank shares fell Thursday by 0.75%, after having risen 2.8% in
early trading.
Without the accounting gain, profit was down 17% in the first quarter. Under
a new International Accounting Standards Board rule called IAS 39, changes
in the value of certain derivatives were included in trading income for the
first time.

""If we take away the accounting change, profit was down in the first
quarter,"" said Manfred Bleijenberg, an analyst at Delta Lloyd Bank in
Amsterdam, who is recommending that clients ""accumulate"" shares of Deutsche
Bank.

The company said its tax bill in the first three months declined 38%.
Germany cut its corporate tax rate this year to 25% from 40%.

However revenue from the bank's private client and asset management division
declined slightly, to $1.79 billion from $1.87 billion, and revenue from
corporate and investment banking declined to $4.47 billion from $4.52
billion.

In a letter sent to shareholders Thursday, Mr. Breuer said, ""We want to
expand our market position in all important areas of business in the current
financial year. He added, ""We expect from this an improvement in our profit
situation compared with our competition.""


Argentina's strife not over yet
Financial Times - May 4, 2001
By Thomas Catan

For the past six months, Argentina's markets have been dominated by a single
question: can the country restart its economy in time to avoid a default on
its Dollars 128bn in debt?

The answer is not yet clear. In his first six weeks back in charge of the
economy, Domingo Cavallo has done much to improve a bad situation after
nearly three years of recession.

He has transformed a fractious political scene and restored the backing of
the International Monetary Fund.

His task was complicated by the fact that Argentina missed its first quarter
fiscal target.

Mr. Cavallo has taken a range of measures to rein in the burgeoning fiscal
deficit to meet the Dollars 6.5bn target agreed with the IMF for this year.

Most recently, he moved to eliminate virtually all exemptions on value added
tax, cut Dollars 900m in spending and increased a tax on financial
transactions from 0.25 per cent to 0.4 per cent.

But those steps have only increased concern that Argentina will not climb
out of recession, in spite of his prediction this week that the economy will
be growing at a 5 per cent clip in the last quarter of the year.

Mr. Cavallo's strategy is unconventional. To restart growth, he has
eliminated import tariffs on capital goods to encourage investment, as well
as cut VAT on those items from 21 per cent to 10.5 per cent.

He will also unveil a series of ""competitiveness plans"" for sectors of
industry that have been hurt by the overvaluation of the peso over the past
couple of years.

The aim is to regain competitiveness without breaking the decade-old peg to
the dollar, which would be disastrous in a country where the vast majority
of public and private sector debt is denominated in dollars.

But investors still question whether the strategy can work, and have pushed
interest rates up to astronomical levels.

Because of those rates, Argentina has long been unable to borrow on
international markets.

Last week it was forced for the first time to cancel a bi-weekly auction of
treasury bills.

Investors will be watching closely to see if Argentina can hold its next
scheduled auction on May 8. If it cannot, then the fears that the country
will have to restructure its debt will again grow stronger, stoking
volatility throughout emerging markets.
Following a brief rally at the start of the year, Argentina's stock market
has again languished.

But razor-thin trading volumes make the country's Merval a poor indicator of
market sentiment. Over the past couple of months it has hovered in a range
of 400 to 460. Yesterday by mid-session the Merval slipped 6.59 to 416.74.

It is the country's bonds that investors will be looking at. They account
for nearly a quarter of the benchmark emerging market debt index, and any
restructuring could spell trouble for such markets around the world.

648,"Dear Mark,
I hope you are doing well.  You may be getting a call from JoAnne Pinkett
regarding a proposal for future funding of the BEAR program.  There has
apparently been some difficulty in communication between the BEAR board and
our board.

Any proposal has to make its way through the Children's Services Committee
then the Executive Committee.  It is then put before the whole board for a
vote.  I thought that you would be an idea person to advise the BEAR
representatives as to how to structure the proposal to the Children's
Committee to ensure that it is given a fair and expeditious review and
decision - a proposal that would be comprehensible to board members who are
not directly involved with the BEAR program.  I also thought you could give
this advice without having to commit a great deal of time (including travel
time for meetings).

I think everyone agrees that it is a great program and that we should be
supportive of such public-private partnerships.  There is probably some
difference of opinion amongst the board as to how much support (and at what
pace) we should give the program.  I would deeply appreciate your helping
the BEAR folks make the clearest proposal possible.  I, for one, want this
program to succeed.  As good as its current work is - I think it holds even
greater potential for benefiting the children we serve.
Thanks for your help,

I was going to write you to propose an alternative meeting venue, but my
firm has issued a stricter prohibition on all overseas travel and US
domestic travel (which stranded my colleagues who are already abroad on
business trips=they have to stay there until further notice). This is in
response to the anthrax incidents and the FBI's terrorism alert.

But, apart from myself, it may be worthwhile considering changing the venue
of the board meeting of November and January to countries that are not
actively participating in the retaliation.
Among the cities in which board members reside, places like Amsterdam,
Madrid, Paris and Milan may be safer. Perhaps we could consider Singapore
and Switzerland, too.

You are right that agendas for these two meetings are very full and
telephone conferences are not adequate. We should meet in person somewhere.
We could split them into several consecutive days' telephone conferences but
you have to get up early and we (including Azam and Steve) would have to
stay up late.

	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the ""Method and System for the Determination of VAR"").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

665,"Lisa,

I'm the commercial person responsible for the sale of the Alberta PPA.  I was looking for an update on where this issue is at.

It is my understanding that we need to have the bankruptcy court bless ENA's shareholders resolution for the sale of the PPA.  Have we applied to the court to hear this matter?  What does the prospective timing look like?  I'm assuming that you are the individual responsible for coordinating this effort.

We are in a situation here where collateral demands ($23.7MM) have been made on Enron Canada Power Corp. which are due on Tuesday, December 18.  ECPC does not have the capacity to post this collateral.  It is my fear that the counterparty demanding the collateral will petition ECPC into court protection upon non-compliance with the collateral demand.

Additionally,  it is unclear how any court proceeding with Enron Canada Corp. may affect both ECPC and the PPA.  It is my understanding that there may be some activity on this front early next week.

Either one of these issues may cause a default under the PPA.  At that point in time the Owner of the PPA is free to terminate.  If the PPA is terminated, the value of this asset would go to zero.  It is clear that the Owner of the PPA is itching to terminate and this would terminate the proposed sale to Altagas Services of $215 MM.

Could you please get back to me with some guidance on this issue.

678,"Dave:

Based on our discussions this morning:

1.  Internal Costs -- a capacity charge will be determined for each wholesale 
business unit based on a time allocation matrix that each lawyer and 
paralegal prepares.  The time allocation matrix will be revised  during the 
year if material changes in the work occur.

2.  Outside Costs -- require internal sign-off by GC and COO to spend more 
than $10,000 on a potential transaction AND a written transaction budget for 
proposed outside legal expenses more than $10,000.  Wherever possible, a firm 
cap on legal fees should be negotiated.  A memorandum will be sent from the 
GC and [Chairman of the Wholesale Group?] laying out the procedure to all 
employees.  

3.  Selection of Outside Lawyers -- expressly add billing rates and 
efficiency as key considerations, in addition to quality, in the selection of 
outside counsel.  [Dave, we need to complete our discussion on this point.]  
Our new policy needs to be reviewed with outside counsel.

4.  Reopener!  -- need to review where business changes significantly.

687,"FYI:

I sent the attached documents to the members of the NWRTO Legal Working
Group this evening.  Given the schedule of events, there is very little
time to touch bases with you folks to verify that the positions stated
in the documents reflect your own. My gut feeling is that they do... but
if there is any positions within the documents with which you take
issue, please let me know.

I won't be able to attend the Legal working group meetings because of
conflicts with the congestion management and ancillary services working
group meetings.  (And if we can't get more commitment to shoring up the
funding of the power marketer coalition, then I may not be attending
those working group meetings after this week either.)  Of all the
contract documents addressed above (TCA, GIA, LIA, Bylaws, Articles), I
think that the ones to which we need to devote the most attention are
the GIA and the TCA.

As to the GIA: I think it would be especially worthwhile if some of you
(Dynegy, Reliant, Calpine) who've been operating under an ISO already -
and who are therefore already sensitive to the burdens that can be
imposed on generators by an ISO/RTO - could give the GIA (and my
comments on the GIA) a thorough technical review and a thorough legal
review.  Since I haven't been on the battlelines in this area, I may
have missed a few issues.  PG&E Gen (Dave) might also want to take a
good look at the document, since I've seen the press releases about the
Umatilla plant near Hermiston.

709,"	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

710,"Keith,

=09If I understand your change to the second paragraph correctly, the new c=
ompressors at Stations 1, 2 and 3 will be completed and placed into service=
 within the one-year deadline in the FERC order. The removal of the existin=
g units at those stations, however, will not be completed until six months =
after that. My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken o=
ut of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational, we sh=
ould be ok and don't need to ask FERC for an extension. The ordering paragr=
aph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in servi=
ce within one year from the date of the order. It does not impose a similar=
 deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities. I take it that we=
 would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time (i.e., c=
ontinue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and place=
d into operation the new compressors), since this would result in TW operat=
ing compression in excess of its certificated capacity. As long as we don't=
 do that, I don't think there's any need to ask for a separate extension fo=

725,"James:

As discussed, you will update this information with Rod Hayslett, in specific regard to the ""estimate"" information that I have generated.  I do not wish to change any of the rate data provided by Southern LNG in the excel spreadsheet, although your comments as to specific areas of concern are most helpful, as I expect Southern LNG to come forth with a number of changes at the time of their ""True-Up Filing"" with the FERC (October 2001 or so).

We talked about the additional costs of the docking pilots on the standby tugs (versus your estimate).

We talked about certain costs that you are going to check with El Paso Merchant Energy (maintenance dredging).

We really have two stripping alternatives - I have shown only ours, as adjusted.  However, I agree with the need to reflect the proposal advanced by El Paso Merchant Energy.  Please work with Rod Hayslett on setting up this alternative in the spreadsheet.

The reason to have Rod develop the model is so we can quickly calculate what the cost-of-service impact will be for various capital projects and, hence, what the comparative economics are.

Regards.

1.  Clean copy of Canadianized EEI base contract
2.  Copy of the Candianized EEI base contract, blacklined to show the changes 
to the US form
3.  Canadianized schedules to the EEI contract, including only the three

I will develop over the next while a set of situation specific riders that 
Enron Canada can use, similar to those riders developed by ENA.

736,"Stan, Thank you for including Dana and me in you Strategic Briefing session 
today.  We both found it to be of considerable value.  Dana and I are already 
kicking around some ideas on how we can think about EOTT's future 
profitability growth in 
a much bolder, creative and innovative manner.  One of our approaches will be 
to add a couple of individuals to our team that will assist us in identifying 
unique opportunities and new approaches to our business.  We will keep you 
apprised of the specifics of this initiative."
737,"Since we are in the process of trying to exit this business the answer from 
Enron Wind would be no.  You might want to contact Condy Plson to see if the 
idea has any value to Enron."
738,"Dear Board Task Force --
Attached is an agenda for the upcoming meeting on April 17.  It is patterned
from the agenda used in the Committee of the Whole meetings held in
Washington in 1993/94 where GISB scope was discussed.  Please let me know if
you have any changes.  Both Bob Gee and Jerry Langdon have agreed to open the
meeting.  Beginning at 1 PM and ending at 6 PM should allow many to get in
and out of Washington on the same day.    Best Regards, Rae

739,"Stan -

Please see the attached email which summarizes our last strawman conference
call.  I wanted to point out where each of the participants was coming from
by separate email.  Hugh Roberts and Alan Knoop, who were attending a
producer meeting were adamantly opposed to the models offered by both Greg
Lander and Jim Templeton.  They did not want any structure which would
diminish their rights and took the position that both were non-starters.
The same was also true of Mike Novak who spoke for the LDC's.  Hugh offered
a third model which kept both gas and electric essentially separate with
what he termed a ""Energy Standards Advisory Communication Liaison"" as the
interface between GISB and EISB (Electric Industry Standards Board).  My
concern was this did not go far enough to assure that cross industry issues
would be addressed.  To bridge the gap, we elevated the bridge to an
""Executive Committee"" level with representation from both gas and electric
with a charter to review only those issues which cut across both industries.
Personally, I view this as an evolutionary process to get all segments
comfortable with the mechanics of dealing with cross industry issues.  If we
push for a combined Board, the votes from the Producers and LDC's are not
there.  Maybe the ""EC level"" is a good start.  We have another conference
call this Thursday.  I would appreciate your thoughts/reaction to this
hybrid strawman recognizing that we have not discussed any details.  Pending
the outcome of this weeks call with Jim, Greg and Rae hopefully in
attendance I will let you know where things stand.  If we are still on this
track after the call, I would like to have a follow up conference call with
the Pipeline segment to get everyone up to speed.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter."

 orientation to enter heaven. 

 They are all asked, ""When you are in your casket and friends and 
 family are mourning upon you, what would you like to hear them say 
 about you? 

 The first guy says, ""I would like to hear them say that I was a 
 great doctor of my time, and a great family man."" 

 The second guy says, ""I would like to hear that I was a wonderful 
 husband and school teacher who made a huge difference in our 
 children of tomorrow."" 

 The last guy replies, 
 ""I would like to hear them say...... LOOK!!! HE'S MOVING!!!!!""

Martha Stewart's Tips for Arkansans
 
 GENERAL:

1. Never take a beer to a job interview
2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.
3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church.
4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.
5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is
still considered rude to drive the U-Haul to the funeral home.


DINING OUT:

1. When decanting wine from the box, make sure that you tilt the
paper cup and pour slowly so as not to ""bruise"" the fruit of the vine.
2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your hands.


ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME:

1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared
by a taxidermist.
2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how good
his manners are.


PERSONAL HYGIENE:

1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that
should done in private, using one's OWN truck keys.
2. Even if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money.
3. Use of proper toiletries can only delay bathing for a few days.
4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend
to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.


DATING (Outside the Family):

1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.
2. Be assertive, let her know you're interested: ""I've been wanting to
go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago"".
3. Establish, with her parents what time, she is expected back.
Some will say 10:00 PM., others might say ""Monday."" If the latter is
the answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.


THEATER ETIQUETTE:

1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up
immediately after the movie has ended.
2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have
proven they can't hear you.


WEDDINGS:

1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.
2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.
3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund
and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance.
4. Though uncomfortable, say ""yes"" to socks and shoes for that
special occasion.


DRIVING ETIQUETTE:

1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun
is loaded and the deer is in sight.
2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest
tires does not always have the right of way.
3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.
4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is
impolite to ask her to bring back beer too.

760,"Hi Wayne, thanks for the reply.  It would be great if you could develop something for item 5.  I think Orlando Alvarado is having difficulty getting anyone from Williams signed up for it.  As for item 6, I may have an interested party for that one but I'll keep you posted.

thanks again,

It just keeps getting uglier and uglier around here.  How are you?  You making any money off getting former Enron folks hired out or are they being treated like lepers?

I've got a resume I'd like to send you if you're interested on a kid who was our business development analyst.  He came from EES and has a good risk management and modeling background.

Let me know if you'd like to see it.

Hope you and Daphne are doing well.

take care,

767,"Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an 
interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us 
this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming 
it is our standard form.  I will check this.

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that 
this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  

Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities?

 I have added the language as item 4 under Other to the Transaction 
Agreement.  If okay, please accept the changes, print, have signed and 
forward to me for further handling. 
"
770,"Ami,

As discussed earlier, the issue is whether all of the Delivery Points 
appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, as amended, are subject to the 
audit of General Service Customers, or whether the audit should narrow the 
focus to the Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast Divisions.  Stated 
differently, the issue is whether quantities of gas required by General 
Service Customers in the Beaumont Division or the South Texas Division should 
be considered part of the Basket.

Transaction No. 1 - Revision No. 1 under the ENFOLIO Agreement states that 
the DCQ obligations apply  to ""Customer's Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast 
Divisions.""  Therefore, although this Transaction identifies the Delivery 
Point(s) as those appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, the intent was 
to exclude Beaumont and South Texas.  In an earlier conversation today, Dan 
Hyvl confirmed that the foregoing was the appropriate analysis of this 
Transaction.

Based on this call, it would appear that, although Exhibit C to the 76 
Agreement lists multiple Delivery Points, the intent was to limit the 
Delivery Point to the Customer group referenced in the heading of the 
applicable ENFOLIO Agreement.

Dan further stated that the boundary lines were redrawn at some time prior to 
December 29, 1998 (the date of the Restructuring Agreement).  We have not 
seen documentation evidencing these changes.  In addition, it was discovered 
that the ""Texas Coast Division"" (referenced on Exhibit C, as amended) is 
actually the ""Gulf Coast Division.""  Dan mentioned that it would be prudent 
for all parties to outline definitive boundaries of divisions for future 
clarification.  Finally, he stated he would meet with you personally to 
discuss these issues with you further.

I hope you find this information useful.  If you have any questions or 
comments, please do not hesitate to call me or Aaron Roffwarg at (713)

I made the same changes to the Canadian form, but don't want to make any 
final changes to the Canadian form without your approval.  When you get a 
minute can you take a look at it and see if the change meets with your 
approval.

Nella, I am enclosing the current form of certificate as well as the revised 
one (which is #1 documents below).  Can you print them out for Peter.

Thanks!

As far as the US$6m  min asset level is concerned it does not specifically 
relate to Australia counterparties (ie those  incorporated in Australia). It 
relates to companies with whom we trade Australian power irrespective of 
place of incorporation. Under our power trading licence requirements we are 
required to take reasonable steps to satisfy ourselves that we are dealing 
with non-retail type investors. There is a check list in the licence of 
requirements , the most relevant for companies not trading in Australia is 
the AUD10m (US$6m) in ""tangible assets"".

Tana thank you for your offer. You are really doing an excellent job pulling 
together a huge amount of information in such an effective. I am loath to do 
anything that would make your job any more difficult. I think we can assume 
that a party which has sufficient assets to trade US power can also trade 
Australian power. As far as Australian incorporated companies are concerned 
we will be checking their suitability Australian power hopefully at the time 
we receive the password application. If not I will pick it up when I check 
your list.

We are trying to finalize the approval of the Japanese counterparty list for 
EnronOnline and are in need of your assistance.  The file attached below 
contains the list of credit approved counterparties.  The first section (rows 
8 - 12) consists of counterparties that are already set-up in EnronOnline.  
No action on your part is required.  Section 2 (rows 14 - 92) consists of 
counterparties that have been approved by credit and are currently being 
review by legal and global contracts.  Can you look over this section and 
verify that the names listed are the correct and full legal name of the 
counterparty?  The counterparty names in this section that do not have a 
corresponding CP ID # (column C) next to the name are currently not set-up in 
our global database.  Therefor, we what to ensure these counterparties are 
set-up correctly.  Section 3 (rows 94 - 114) consists of counterparties that 
credit is going to approve, but have been unable to identify the correct and 
full legal counterparty name.  Can you provide this information for us.  As 
the launch date is quickly approaching, it is critical that we receive this 
information as soon as possible.

As mentioned above, the legal and global teams are completing the final 
reviews and creating new records in the global database.  I have given your 
name to several members of these teams.  You may receive request from them 
over the next couple of days to assist them with questions.  I hope that this 
does not create any conflicts for you, but I believe that this may expedite 
this process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

This is to follow up today's conversation with Anita.  As mentioned Paul 
Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24.  On 
reflection given the strong line up for Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we 
would very much like Vince to be the speaker on Wednesday.  This will 
conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be there 
for the Wednesday. 

I gather that this change should be acceptable to Vince.  

We will show Vince's name as follows:

It has been some time since we spoke at the San Antonio conference.  
Unfortunately,as soon as I got to India I was diagnosed wih a slip disc and 
had to be in bed for a long time.

In the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to 
another state out of the Dabhol plant.  I have developed the concept whereby 
we are now looking at a firm component (over peak period), and an infirm 
power sale during the monsoon.

The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below 
should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal.  I am currently in 
Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870.  I maybe needing a surgery for the 
slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won't be needed.

I would like to wis you all a very happy X'Mas and a Great New Year, and will 
catch you in the NEw YEar in Houston to discuss this wit you further.  I can 
see that soem structuring help will be needed on this, and would like to get 
some help from your end.

896,"This has been a great year for RBAC and GPCM.
During the year we have doubled to 10 the number of GPCM licensees.
This means we've also doubled the number of wonderful people we've trained
and are supporting.
And, I sincerely mean it when I say it has been a real pleasure working
with you all.
One of the things we stress when we are selling GPCM is that it takes a
strong commitment on the part of the licensee, a commitment to find skilled
and dedicated people to make optimal use of this sophisticated tool.  And,
I'm happy to report that we have that quality in the GPCM teams we work
with.
Next year we have some big challenges.  We will be converting the system
from Office 97 to Office 2000 and will also need to make sure it will run
in the Windows 2000 environment.
We will be adding new flexibility in defining our transportation zone price
curves to enable users, especially pipeline users, to test variations of
pricing strategies for their impacts on basis and utilization.
We will be adding a capability for modeling future FT contracting.
We will upgrade our existing Database Comparison program to allow you to
select those items you want to have automatically updated in your own
databases.
We will continue to work with RDI to improve pipeline and storage
infrastructure representations, to provide interfaces between GASdat and
GPCM, and to give you regular optional updates for your own databases.
We are beginning to plan out a new website dedicated to GPCM licensees (and
possibly prospects).  We have acquired gpcm.rbac.com and gpcm.net for this
purpose.
In making these various changes, we look also to you, our existing
licensees, for enhancement and improvement ideas.  We are planning to
conduct interviews of our licensees during the next 30 - 60 days to find
out what you like, but also what you would like to see improved, as well as
some new ideas for GPCM.

I would like to thank the following people for their contributions to GPCM
during 1999.

o Liam Leahy for his excellent marketing, sales, and planning support
o Charles Carr for his quality work on our website and support with subtle
Visual Basic programming issues
o Richard Berman for thorough research on design tools and skilled Windows
programming
o Richard McBride for continuing support and development of his EMNET
optimization program
o Aaron and James Brooks for design and production of the PowerPoint
pipeline maps now available in GPCM
o Mike Farina and RDI for their continuing improvement of the GPCM data and
GASdat database
o GPCM users who have found data bugs and reported them to use so that we
could get them corrected
o GPCM users who have suggested new features which would make GPCM a better
product
o GPCM users who have given us sales leads during the year
o GPCM users who have used GPCM to help their companies make better plans
and decisions, which is, after all, the purpose for which it was designed

We hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season and look forward to an
even better year 2000.

Just want to confirm our conversation regarding your interest in the Wharton 
Tiger Teams 1& 3 and your intent to hire interested members into the summer 
associate program.  You stated that you could take all members into your 
research group for the summer.  Kristin Gandy is now in the process of 
obtaining from either you or members of your department the names of the 
individuals on teams 1 & 3.  Some of these individuals may have interviewed 
with us during the campus process.  If they did and were turned down by the 
team for a summer position, we will not extend offers to those individuals.  
Otherwise, if you are willing to take the additional Tiger Team Members into 
your group based on the experience you and your staff have had in working 
with these students, then the Associate Program will facilitate those offers.

At mid summer and the end of the summer, these Wharton MBAs' performance will 
be evaluated and cross-calibrated with other summer associates to determine 
whether they receive an offer to join the full-time Associate Program.  
Offers will be given to those summer associate who achieve extremely high 
performance ratings.

As soon as Kristin receives the names of these individuals and determines 
which members did not already interview, she will get out both a verbal and 
offer to them.

As follow-up, Jana Giovannini, Manager of Staffing in Career Development, 
will staff those that accept our offer from this Tiger Team list into your 
group for the summer.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and

the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you. 

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the

Mid week, audit  findings will be released; audit expected to show PG&E's 
utility subsidiary handed over $5B to the holding company. The holding 
company used $4.4B to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock.
State commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible 
bankruptcy scenario.  Bankruptcy still very possible for both 
      companies.
Davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue 
solutions or ""bail out"".

Legislation
There will be continued discussion regarding bill AB1X in the Senate today.  
The discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour as 
well as the term.  Assemblyman Keeley, the author, indicated that he believed 
5.5 cents was ""a fantasy"" and impossible to obtain. 

Today, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred 
Keeley, D-Boulder Creek will introduce legislation whereby the state
would temporary or permanently take both PG&E and Edision's hydroelectric 
facilities or transmission lines (or both) in exchange for keeping the 
utilities out of 
bankruptcy.  The state would allow PG&E and Edison to impose rate increases, 
however, the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this 
month by the CPUC as an emergency surcharge.  The money collected from 
consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state 
would then enter into long-term contracts with power generators.  Under the 
bill, the state of California would control 10% of all California's 
electricity.  As you 
can imagine, this legislation has not received unanimous praise.  According 
to recent corporate filings, PG&E's hydroelectric plants alone would be 
valued 
between $3 and $5 billion.  This amount just happens to be what Davis 
estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee 
once 
the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is 
escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $12 billion in debt.  
Davis 
is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help 
with about $4 billion in debt, while the utilities, of course, say the full 
$12 billion should 
be covered. 

On Wednesday, state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy 
suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their 
effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come.  Davis 
insists there are already several bids for his 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour 
ceiling, though few 
agree with his opinion.  A handful of smaller, independent electricity 
providers with about a 30% share of California power market, indicated Sunday 
night they would come down to ""less than eight cents"" or less than half of 
what they currently charge, in return for the stability of long term 
contracts.  Because 
consumers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current 
PUC rules, any hope California has to ""work off"" the back debts for these 
utilities lies 
in hitting something very close to Davis' price cap, without falling back on 
higher prices for consumers.  The level of bids will be particularly 
important since bond
rating agencies moved to put the state of California on a Credit watch on 
Friday, worried that there was no obvious long-term repayment plan for the 
billions of 
dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state.

Utility's Audit
By the middle of this week, California auditors will release their findings 
about how much money PG&E and SoCal Edison actually owe to institutions 
outside their own holding company structure. This will define the limits of 
what the state will guarantee, if they guarantee any of the debt. The truly 
explosive 
part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of 
dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years.  A  
source with
knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last 
three years, PG&E's utility subsidiary handed over about $5 billion to the 
holding 
company. Of that total, the holding company used $4.4 billion to pay 
shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock. 

Another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current 
power crisis when regulators, at the time of deregulation (under the 
direction of 
Former R-Gov. Pete Wilson), forced the two utilities to sell at least half of 
their power-generating plants.  Auditors are expected to say that if the 
utilities 
still owned all these plants, electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt 
hour, compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in December and January.

Bankruptcy
The threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities.  Senior 
advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility 
companies that 
ended in bankruptcy.  As all the parties involved hunker down for another 
intensely political week, they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy, but 
to push 
this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an 
advantage.  Under such conditions, the risks of one or more of the players 
fumbling and
triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy, is still quite high. 
 
California's political leaders order a series of independent analyses to 
determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy, the state or the two 
utilities.
The short answer was that no one has any idea.  Below are the findings of the 
report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge:

1) Would the companies be eligible for Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy? 
Some of the advisors thought that PG&E and Edison's finances were so 
bad that Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option.  
Advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate 
debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the 
companies into full liquidation.   This would most certainly be guaranteed 
chaos.
2) Could the bankruptcy court actually force the PUC to raise the price of 
electricity to consumers? The legal basis for passing on rate increases to 
consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought, particularly if there 
is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies.   And 
there is still the 
question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge.
3) If the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets 
seriously and finds that PG&E and Edison cannot afford to buy electricity, 
he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages.
4) If the utilities go into bankruptcy, the first creditors in line would be 
the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges.  The state could become 
almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier  
(one of the reasons why suppliers won't sell electricity on credit to these 
companies now).
5) If the two companies went bankrupt, it would be the largest bankruptcies 
in history, straining just about everyone involved in the process.
6) The corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets 
from the utility by the FERC for PG&E and already in place for Edison 
may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies 
currently think. This is particularly true if this week's audit shows the two 
corporations transferring 
billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder 
dividend payments.

Davis
Opinion polls show that Governor Gray Davis is getting high marks for his 
job, and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits.  One of Davis 
concern's is, according to a senior official in the Governor's office, that a 
deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so 
anti-utility and 
anti-business that it cripples future growth in the state.  According to a 
senior official, ""No one thought Howard Jarvis and his property tax 
initiative would 
succeed in destroying our education system, but he did, with one just ballot 
line and a lot of popular revulsion. The threat of direct, popular action
is at least as large now as then.""  Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield is 
already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that 
individual 
electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay 
their debt through higher rate-payer bills.  This official goes on to say, 
""The 
anger at utility companies is so high here, that almost anything Rosenfield 
could think of would pass and we couldn't do anything about it.""  This threat 
has 
begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always 
appeared wide open to political leaders -- floating a bond issue or a 
guarantee 
for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure, 
and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next 
several years. "

Good to hear from you and I can understand being busy. I am myself trying to

Like any research consortium Pserc is trying to provide value to its members

definitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to the

2.  The WTI EOL trading simulation had an error.   We were counting a

on each round-trip transaction (one trade to open, one trade to close).    I 
modified the calculation and sent the new numbers to Greg Whalley (he is the

940,"Vince, just FYI:
Oliver (Risk Control in London) was asking if it is appropriate to use a set 
of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity.
This ""mapping"" we do quite frequently in our VAR system when forward prices 
for a commodity are not correlated (because of poor price history).

I think using this kind of mappings is OK because we can not trust these 
correlations based on illiquid price information.
If we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in 
the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 factors - then
we might use more factors then 7 or the matrix itself.

969,"Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid 
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak 
sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and 
voicemail.  While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and 
management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a 
confidential call

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and 
Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company.  So don't 
be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.  We want to hear from you."

975,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

I am planning to make my resignation from Enron so that June 5th would be my last day at work.   I am interested in the trading opportunity this fall and will talk again with Andy about it.    It will still make sense for me to resign in the mean time in order that I may start burning my non-compete period to open up my other options.   In addition, it  will allow me to be rehired without the burden of the noncompete should I come back in the fall.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

	

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:

1003,"Kevin,

 the memo looks good.  One suggestion I have is to emphasize what we can 
deliver by end of January since that was the initial deadline.  Although the 
memo indicates that a lot of work has been done, the reader might want to 
know what he can get in his hand in terms of models or quantitative results.  
You will of course describe everything in your presentation, but given that 
setting up presentations may take time, you should think about creating some 
template/model and send it with brief explanations.  For example, a template 
for TRS as it stands, and a template listing trigger events and how the 
results will be displayed.  You can then expand on this in your presentations.

I am forwarding an analysis put together by Sandeep Kohli and reviewed by 
Vince and me.  The results in the attached word document show that Dabhol 
energy costs are several cents below that of roughly 600 MW of distributed 
generation which has been identified in Maharastra.  This 600 MW does not 
include innumerable small generators which will have even worse energy 
costs.  The excel spreadsheet contains the data and calculations.

The copy of the auction results that you got at yesterday's meeting is 
incorrect. What happened was when I tried to sort the entire page, I only 
highlighted the related column and expected Excel 98 would sort the whole 
page. (As Steve told me before, I should highlight the whole thing if I try 
to do sorting in Excel). I appolized for the misleading and have redone the 
whole thing.  Thanks for the patience. Wish you all have a great weekend.

Part 2, scheduled for this coming Monday.

1013,"PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation

1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.""

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.""

2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3.	New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer."""

Title: California on the Brink 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas 

CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK 
The California Stalemate 
California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over 
credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would 
avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have 
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the 
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current 
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address 
the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be 
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.

Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this 
summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California 
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, 
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and 
significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied 
the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end 
their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance 
the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable 
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market. 

The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the 
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to 
address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is 
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective 
solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail 
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain 
muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is 
possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail 
to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will 
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws. 

In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western 
markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem. 
Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market 
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and 
demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for 
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed, 
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by 
discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated 
changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a 
challenging siting and permitting process.

Medicine Worse than the Illness 
Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were 
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay 
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus 
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of 
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of 
California's electric market woes.* 

* Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better 
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power 
plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone 
has struck down some key proposed facilities.

* Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices 
limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially 
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment 
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. 

* Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including 
the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new 
plant development.

* Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the 
FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the 
California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of 
gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits 
are a threat to new plant development.

* Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials 
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of 
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.

CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West 
are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability 
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of 
older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. 
California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of 
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers 
considering entering the state. 

Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in 
the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that 
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. 
In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a 
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the 
earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of 
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk 
of an outage. 

The Road to Recovery 
There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity 
shortfall: 

* Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a 
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal 
some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these 
actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not 
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.? 

* Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will 
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the 
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new 
build.

* Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the 
pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence 
(and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in 
the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With 
the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move 
toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a 
series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If 
they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect 
of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient 
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments.

* Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although 
originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are 
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing 
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a 
demand response.

* Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the ""Boom Bust"" characteristic of 
the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, 
or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to 
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the 
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to 
elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate) 
future price volatility.

* Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to 
be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable 
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term 
contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the 
market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since 
July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to 
do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its 
course. 

* Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a 
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply 
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to 
emissions restrictions. 

* Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA 
power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from 
operating to generate only power.

SHARPLY WEAKER DEMAND AND GROWING STOCKS TO DAMPEN REFINING MARGINS

Spot refining margins are likely to experience sustained weakness for the
balance of 2001 and into 2002, under the influence of

*  weakening refined product demand resulting from the global economic
slowdown, significant cutbacks in airline flight schedules, and the outlook for
much lower North American natural gas prices this winter

*  the likelihood of growing crude oil and product stocks as OPEC confronts the
growing challenging of continuing to manage the market in the face of rapidly
slowing demand and growing non-OPEC productive capacity

The only significant upside risk to margins in the near term lies in events--
possibly linked to new terrorist attacks or the ongoing military campaign--that
could disrupt the oil supply chain.

1031,"Folks,

I am forwarding this in order for the team to focus on the naphtha issue.  
Please note that:

As Phase II comes on line, Blocks B and C will first have to run on naphtha 
for a period of 3-6 months
This will hit us some time in 2001, hence is a more urgent issue than LNG, 
which is still a year away
If there are delays in the commissioning of the Regas terminal, the period on 
naphtha could further prolong
The naphtha market is more volatile than the crude market, and is not as 
deep, hence we need to take small positions early on to test the market
DPC Board has already approved a Risk Management Policy that allows for 
hedging.  We may need to look into options that are costless (selling put and 
buying call) to begin with, and test while only Block A is in place.
Close coordination will be required on this with the Global Markets group, 
and I propose someone like Anshuman should actually be seconded onto the group
A whole plan on tools to manage the fuel risk need to be worked in close 
coordination with the team on the ground

These are just some of my thoughts.  With 50% of the tariff being fuel price 
dependent, this is an area that requires close attention.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Thank you for the detailed info on the required data and thoughts on its 
scope.  I'll discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning.  Also agree that 
we'll almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust 
model off more comprehensive data to start with.

Cheers,
Scott

1036,"Dear all,

Following up with Vince's meeting on full requirement, we might just start 
with the existing Psim model.
The attached spreadsheet  is still running !

You need to create a directory H:\projects\pwrsim before your run the model.  
If you want to re-run the model,
you need to close the report because re-run causes the program re-write the 
report.

Let us first review what is already there in the PSIM model, if we can live 
with the simplistic dispatch
logic in PSIM, the PSIM is the deliverable product for the full requirement 
deal. 

Alex agrees to write an agenda for this project before the Friday meeting.

solution for the power crisis is energy conservation through the use of

                 U.S., CHINA SIGN HISTORIC TRADE AGREEMENT

BEIJING, November 15, 1999    U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
and National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling today announced the
successful completion of bilateral talks on China?s accession to the World
Trade Organization.

Ambassador Barshefsky and Mr. Sperling issued a joint statement that said,
AWe are glad that after thirteen years of negotiation, China and the United
States have agreed upon a strong, commercially viable WTO agreement for
China.  This historic agreement is a win for American export-related jobs,
for Chinese economic reform, for our global trading system and for the
long-term U.S. - China relationship.

Outline of the Agreement

This agreement provides significant access for U.S. agriculture, industrial
products and services.  China will reduce both tariff and non-tariff
barriers to industrial goods and farm products.  The agreement contains
strong provisions to address import surges and unfair trade practices.
China has agreed to take specific actions to ensure fair treatment for
businesses operating in China.  These include limits on technology transfer
requirements, offsets and export performance requirements.

Some specific examples from the agreement include:

China will cut duties from an overall average of 22.1% to 17%.
China will make even greater reductions on agricultural items of particular
     interest to the United States.
China will establish large and increasing tariff-rate quotas for wheat,
     corn, rice and cotton with a substantial share reserved for private
     trade.
State trading for soy oil will be phased out.
China will eliminate export subsidies.
American companies can provide auto financing.
New access for U.S. companies, including banks, insurance companies and
     telecommunications businesses.
Distribution rights for U.S. exporters.
Improved access for computer services, business consulting, accounting,
     advertising,  and financial information services.
Increased imports of foreign films, on a revenue-sharing basis, to at least
     twenty films per year.

In textiles, the U.S. and China agreed on appropriate measures to avoid
     market disruptions during and after the phase out of current quotas.


Next Steps

This agreement represents a crucial step in China?s WTO accession process.
Several important steps remain ahead.  First China must conclude bilateral
negotiations with a number of other WTO members, including the European
Union.  Multilateral negotiations on China?s accession protocol must also
be finished.  China must then complete its own domestic procedures for
accession.

In response to the commitments contained in the agreement signed today,
President Clinton will work with other WTO member countries to gain China?s
entry as soon as possible and will seek from Congress the approval of
permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR).

""In connection with mid-year VP PRC, I would like each of you to prepare a 
list of accomplishments, 2000 goals achieved, etc.""

Steve,

Per your July 7th request:

Performance Based Rates Analysis and Training for SK-Enron.  The ultimate 
commercial objective is to establish a rate making framework for Korean gas 
distribution companies that will allow theJV's operating companies to retain 
profits derived from efficiency gains and earned returns that exceed the 
statuatory rate of return.  Analysis of several PBR mechanisms demonstrated 
the potential benefits from replacing the current Cost of Service framework 
with an incentive based system.  An eductional workshop based on the results 
of this analysis was organized and presented to Executive, Financial and 
Regulatory staffs of the JV and its 9 City Gas Companies.
Improved Cost of Service Rate Filing Procedures and Methods. The commercial 
objective is to improve the results achieved by SK-Enron's City Gas Companies 
when preparing and negotiating new rates under the current COS framework 
employed in Korea.  Several areas within the current framework where 
""forward-looking"" cost calculation methods could be employed to better match 
costs that will be incurred while new rates are in effect and the revenues 
earned were identified.  The need and benefit of determining the cost of 
service for each class of customer was also demonstrated.  Results of the 
analysis and methodology for determining COS by customer class was presented 
to the Executive, Financial and Regulatory staffs of the JV and its 9 CGCs.  
Elimination of 10% Dividend Restriction imposed on the City Gas Companies of 
SK-Enron.  The commercial objective is to more effectively employ cash 
generated within the JV's CGCs by freeing these companies from a Ministry of 
Commerce, Industry, and Energy ""guideline"" limiting dividends to 10% of each 
company's par stock value.  The initial approach was to develop a program 
that would consolidate all of the JV's CGCs into the Joint Venture company 
and thereby eliminate the need for dividends that would give the holding 
company access to opertating cash flows.  The regulatory implications of such 
an effort were analyzed and provided to the project team.  Opinion sampling 
of local regulators indicated strong opposition to such a strategy.  This 
insight plus tax issues of Enron's partner, led to the conclusion that 
implementation of this strategy would be difficult.  A direct lobbying 
program to convince MOCIE to lift this guideline is currently being developed.
Feasibility of EnronOnLine launch in Korea.  The commercial objective is to 
create the opportunity for Korean companies to become customers of Enron's 
worldwide trading network.  Initial due diligence has established the 
feasibility of offering commodity products such as crude oil, refined 
products, and LPG and has identified issues the must be addressed with the 
Korean government to effectively deal in financial and weather derivatives.
Required Korean consents and other regulatory matters for Project Summer.  
The commercial objective is to enhance Enron shareholder value.  Regulatory 
consents possibly required were identified and contractual issues with 
Enron's partner have been highlighted.
Gas transmission company ratemaking workshop for Korean Gas Company (KOGAS) 
and Korean Energy Economics Institute (KEEI).  The commercial objective is to 
have Korea adopt an open access gas tranmission rate framework that is 
supportive of LNG marketing by Enron in Korea and improving gas supply cost 
of the JV's CGCs.  A workshop for representatives of KOGAS and KEEI was 
organized in Houston and introductions were made to the FERC staff in 
Washington DC.  The KEEI work product from its rate study effort has not been 
made available as of this date because of internal issues within KOGAS.
Keynote speaking role for APACHE CEO at Asia Pacific Economic Council Energy 
Ministers Meeting.  The commercial objective of this effort was to improve 
Enron APACHE's ability to shape policies relating to its business by raising 
the profile of its CEO amoung senior energy officials from throughout Asia.  
Rebecca McDonald was one of three Key Note speakers for the opening of the 
conference.  She was accorded this honor even though Enron contributed a 
fraction of the financial support for the conference that several other 
energy companies did.  Her remarks on e:commerce and energy received 
considerable positive attention from many attendees including the Korean 
delegation.  
Meeting with US Embassador to Korea.  The commercial objective was to improve 
Enron's chances of winning bids for energy assets, particularly electric 
generation facilities scheduled to be privatized by the government.  A 
meeting was organized for myself, SK-Enron's Chief Operating officer, and the 
JV's General Manager of Operations.  Based on the experience in bidding late 
in 1999, the Embassador was urged to advocate for more transparent and less 
subjective bid evaluation procedures that substantially increased the 
likelihood of closure on asset sales.  Ultimately, sucessful privatization 
will create both asset acquisition and commodity marketing opportunities."

San Diego Union-Tribune, 12/12/00

Colombia's Medellin Utility Appeals Isagen Ruling, Paper Says
Bloomberg, 12/12/00



Energy costs rocket, handing consumers biggest shock yet 



By Craig D. Rose 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
December 12, 2000 
Power prices in California keep hitting new heights, with prices in the 
state's main electricity market rising today to nearly $900 per megawatt 
hour. 
The rise continues a stunning ascent from a price of about $50 per megawatt 
hour as recently as last spring. In retail terms, today's prices -- if 
sustained for a month -- would result in an average residential power bill of 
more than $450. 
San Diego ratepayers are temporarily shielded from such high bills by a 
rate-deferral plan in effect at least until 2002. 






The latest prices represent a more than tripling in posted prices on the 
California Power Exchange since Friday, when the operator of the state power 
grid removed a state-mandated price cap of $250. 
The latest escalation -- which comes despite improvements yesterday in state 
power supplies -- is deepening the sense of crisis among state officials, 
consumer advocates and utility companies. 
Nonetheless, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, who met yesterday with top 
energy advisers in Los Angeles, said it was unlikely there would be action to 
address the crisis at the state level until after federal regulators release 
their plan for California. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to issue a final order 
regarding California's market at its meeting tomorrow. But yesterday the 
commission made plans for a second meeting Friday to deal with the state's 
problems, and did not clarify at which session it would issue the California 
order. 
Davis and others in the state have been critical of FERC's refusal to halt 
what they describe as a devastating rise in power prices here or to order 
refunds for payments made by consumers over the past summer. 
The governor also has been severely critical of the California Independent 
System Operator's decision to lift the state price cap last week. The ISO 
manages most of the state's power supply. 
Privately, most at the state level remain skeptical that federal action will 
ease the crisis, saying it will be up to California to fix the problem. Last 
Friday, FERC quickly approved the ISO's plan to end the price cap. 
Increasingly, state officials and consumer activists are talking about 
state-owned power systems, utility takeovers and a likely initiative seeking 
to overturn deregulation. SDG&E and others also emphasize the need for a 
price cap for the Western region of the United States, in order to prevent 
suppliers from migrating to the highest prices and driving prices upward 
everywhere. 
The new highs in electricity prices came even as the ISO said the state's 
supplies had improved, with the start-up of production from a formerly closed 
nuclear power plant unit. 
The apparent contradiction between the increase in available power and the 
continued price escalation was blamed on a number of factors: 
High prices for natural gas -- which fuels power plants -- continued to drive 
up the cost of generating electricity. Cold conditions in the Midwest helped 
push natural gas prices to record highs yesterday. 
Allegations also persist that energy companies have manipulated the market. 
Consumers Union and other advocacy groups say deregulating electricity prices 
has proven to be a costly error for California consumers. 
At the same time, the controversial removal of price caps in California is 
allowing prices to rise to levels approaching those in other Western states. 
""We've now had three days of the Hebert experiment,"" said state Sen. Steve 
Peace, D-El Cajon. Peace was referring to Curt Hebert, a FERC commissioner 
who opposes price caps for wholesale electricity. 
Peace, who played a prime role in California's deregulation legislation, 
likened the run-up in electricity prices to the oil embargo of the 1970s and 
warned that it could devastate the economy. 
""Someone from (former Gov. Pete) Wilson's administration told me, 'Somebody 
in the energy business decided it's time for a depression,'?"" said Peace, who 
has also been critical of FERC's failure to rein in prices. ""This is not 
about electricity. It's about the economy."" 
In a letter to FERC yesterday, Peace repeated earlier calls for a federal 
order returning the state to regulated power prices based on the cost of 
production. 
Market watchers said little could help the state over the next few days, 
except Mother Nature. 
""The prices will remain at these levels, unless you get a warming trend,"" 
said Alex Galatic of Strategic Energy, a Pittsburgh-based energy company with 
offices in Carlsbad. 
Market speculators appear to be betting against a break in price any time 
soon. For example, electricity is selling for $800 per megawatt hour in the 
Pacific Northwest for delivery in January, Galatic said. 
""I see no break in the pricing,"" agreed Arthur O'Donnell, editor of 
California Energy Markets,? a publication based in San Francisco. 
A spokesman for Enron Corp., the largest electricity trader in the United 
States, said the raising of prices in California had improved supplies 
available to the state. And he added that there was another positive aspect 
to the higher commodity prices. 
""You are starting to see some demand response,"" said Mark Palmer, the Enron 
spokesman, referring to cutbacks in power use as prices soar. ""Some companies 
are shutting down because it makes more sense to sell their gas (rather than 
using it as fuel to continue their manufacturing operations)."" 
That's not an option for the state's utility companies, which continue to 
report growing losses from buying electricity at higher costs than they can 
collect from their customers. They have covered the shortfall by borrowing 
money. 
Dow Jones Newswires reported that Pacific Gas & Electric was only ""weeks"" 
away from being unable to cover its power costs if prices continue at recent 
levels. 
A spokesman for the Bay Area utility's parent company declined to comment 
directly on the report. 
""It's up to the decision of creditors to make that call,"" said Greg Pruett, 
vice president of communications for PG&E. ""We have already borrowed $2.6 
billion to cover undercollections that have totaled $4.6 billion. 
""It can't continue forever."" 

Colombia's Medellin Utility Appeals Isagen Ruling, Paper Says
12/12/0 9:14 (New York)


     Bogota, Dec. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Colombia's largest municipal
utility, Empresas Publicas de Medellin, said it will appeal a high
court decision barring it from buying a majority stake in state-
run generator Isagen, the daily El Espectador reported.
     EPM general manager Ramiro Valencia said government plans to
sell its 76 percent stake in Isagen could not go ahead until the
appeal and other lawsuits filed by EPM are resolved, the report
said. Colombia in September suspended the Isagen sale, which it
hoped would raise $340 million, pending a Council of State ruling
on an EPM suit filed alleging bias in the sales process.
     The Council of State, which oversees state agencies, ruled
Friday that the energy regulator was in its rights when it ruled
earlier this year against any single company taking a majority
stake in Isagen to avoid market dominance.
     EPM is planning to purchase the government's 76 percent stake
in Isagen together with Enron Corp. of the U.S. to avoid the anti-
monopoly regulations.

1132,"Attached is a summary of the results of our effort to deploy talent within 
Enron.  From today forward, Cindy will manage the effort with the help of her 
Resource Management team headed by Sarah Davis.  Cindy's team is also 
developing a process to manage the movement of talent around Enron on an 
ongoing basis.

As you can see we have accomplished a great deal in a short time, thanks in 
large part to the efforts and cooperation of the business unit organizations 
and the Human Resources organization.  Highlights include:

60 commercial employees who have accepted offers
19 additional commercial employees with offers pending
74 employees who are being redeployed by their global function or corporate 
staff group

A conservative estimate of the direct costs saved by this effort (as compared 
to outside recruiting and relocation) is $75,000/employee (or about $4.5 
million so far).  Far more important than the direct cost savings, though, 
are the productivity gains, the opportunity gains associated with deploying 
resources quickly to critical business areas, and the savings resulting from 
reducing management time spent in recruiting and interviewing.

This effort has focussed on the redeployment of approximately 300 employees 
in three main groups:

Identification of commercial employees across Enron to be contacted and 
redeployed to EBS, EES and ENA.  There are 92 such employees (not counting 
APACHI employees).  These employees were contacted, interviewed and are being 
placed, if they are interested, in one of the three organizations (EBS, EES 
or ENA).

Identification of APACHI employees who are available as a result of the 
region's efforts to refocus its activities on the opportunities in Japan, 
Korea and Australia.  There are 208 employees in this category 62 of whom are 
commercial employees being placed as a result of this effort.

The remaining group of 146 APACHI employees consist of global function, staff 
and support groups which are redeploying them to support constrained areas 
throughout Enron.

Attached is a chart summarizing the progress so far.  Thank you for your 
support and cooperation."
1133,"Mike - perhaps you can help me or forward this on to someone who can.  The 
people in my organization support all the Enron business units but many are 
specifically dedicated to certain business units.  As a consequence, we have 
ended up on a variety of LANs with a variety of support people.  Due to the 
fine efforts of your team, many people in my group have migrated over to the 
Enron Corp LAN.  We are also now enjoying great support from Russell & 
Russell (Servat and Mitchell).  As the IT guy, I'm sure you are accustomed to 
such profuse praise.

However, many of the people on my team (including me) are on the EES LAN.  
Historically, EES has supported us with the equipment we need and they too 
have been doing a fine job in that regard.  Historically, therefore, we have 
not budgeted for IT .... a practice which will change starting next year.  In 
the meantime, when we sought to migrate the rest of my organization to the 
CORP LAN we were told that we would have to pay for all of our current
equipment or give it back to EES.  If you need me to, I can explain in detail 
why this makes no sense."
1134,"Steve:

As you requested, the following is a detailed update on pipeline safety 
legislation currently moving through Congress:

Pipeline safety reauthorization legislation

Authorization for pipeline safety programs, as administered by the U.S. Dept. 
of Transportation, Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), is currently set to 
expire at the end of FY 2000.    At the beginning of the 106th Congress, 
industry was focused on securing a simple, two year re-authorization bill 
that basically extends current pipeline safety programs with some modest 
increases in funding levels.  In fact, the House Commerce Committee (who 
shares jurisdiction over pipeline safety with the Transportation & 
Infrastructure Committee) acted early in 1999 to pass a simple, two year 
reauthorization bill (H.R. 1378).

Unfortunately, the issue became more complex from that point.   A serious 
liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham, Washington that occurred last summer, 
killing several children, dramatically changed the debate over pipeline 
safety.   Members of the House and Senate from Washington state (backed by 
the governor and numerous state and local officials) moved swiftly to 
introduce legislation that they feel is designed to address some of the 
shortcomings in federal pipeline regulation that they believe may have 
allowed the Bellingham incident to occur.

In the Senate, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) has introduced S. 2004, which is 
designed to expand State authority over interstate pipelines in several new 
areas, such as inspection and testing, emergency response plans, leak 
detection, and operator training and qualification.   The bill also would 
authorize a large increase in OPS funding through pipeline user fees, to 
increase the amount of grants to the States, allow for hiring of additional 
inspectors, and increase R&D for inspection and leak detection technologies.  
The current OPS budget is around $36 million (with $30 million from user 
fees) -- the Murray bill would authorize $50 million in FY2001, which would 
require a sizeable increase in user fees.  Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) has 
recently decided to co-sposnor the Murray bill, and will be actively involved 
in trying to gain Republican support for the bill.   On the House side, Rep. 
Jack Metcalf (R-WA) has introduced a similar bill, H.R. 3558, which a number 
of the Washington representatives have co-sponsored.

Interstate natural gas pipelines have been placed in a very difficult 
situation.    The Bellingham incident was a liquid pipeline accident, and 
liquids pipelines generally have less stringent regulatory requirements than 
natural gas pipelines.   The Washington delegation has highlighted the fact 
that 280 deaths and 1500 injuries have occurred over the past 14 years 
related to natural gas pipeline incidents, but they fail to distinguish the 
fact that almost all of those incidents were on LDC systems (which 
ironically, are entirely State regulated).  Only 39 fatalities in that period 
were natural-gas related, and the majority of those accidents were caused by 
third party damage.  In short, the INGAA crowd is being dragged down by the 
poor records of the LDCs and the liquid pipelines.    

The calls for more state regulation of interstate pipeline are largely 
misguided, based on the fact that the interstate pipelines under federal 
regulation have an exemplary safety record.   In addition, OPS is already 
working on a ""Pipeline Integrity"" Rulemaking that would implement a number of 
additional measures to prevent accidents on federally-regulated pipelines.

As you mentioned, INGAA has not been doing the best job representing us on 
these issues.  They have been working in a group effort with API, AGA, and 
the Association of Oil Pipelines (AOPL) to try and deflect the negative 
claims of the Murray and Metcalf legislation, but have not been forceful 
enough in distinguishing interstate natural gas pipelines' positive record 
from the liquids and LDCs.  Thus, they have given the impression that INGAA 
companies might be willing to submit to additional regulation that liquids 
and LDC are under political pressure to submit to due to Bellingham.  We have 
been working with other major INGAA companies (El Paso, in particular) to 
make sure that the perspective and positive record of our natural gas 
pipelines is heard clearly by the key legislators.

The odds of these measures (S. 2004, H.R. 3558) passing on their own is 
fairly slim.   They will get a great deal of attention, however.  The Senate 
Commerce Committee held a field hearing in Bellingham, Washington yesterday, 
at which Senators Gorton and Murray testified along with OPS and the families 
of Bellingham victims -- the press coverage was not good (i.e., USA Today 
cover story ""When Pipelines Are Time Bombs"").   These bills (or portions of 
them) will likely be offered and considered as amendments to Pipeline Safety 
Reauthorization legislation as it comes before the House Transportation & 
Infrastructure and Senate Commerce Committee later this year.   

The increased controversy caused by these bills will likely doom efforts to 
pass a pipeline safety reauthorization bill this year.   The leadership of 
the House and Senate Committees will not likely want to face a bitter debate 
between safety advocates, OPS, States, and industry in their committees in 
this tough election year.   While this is probably a good sign, there is an 
increased risk that industry may face some large hurdles in the 
appropriations process.

Appropriations Legislation

While Members of Congress push for their stand alone bills and/or amendments 
to reauthorization bills, the greater danger is that some of these issues 
will be dealt with in an appropriations context.    In particular, the fact 
that Senator Slade Gorton is now actively engaged in pushing for extensive 
pipeline safety reforms is troubling -- he is a key member of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, is close to Republican leadership, and has a tough 
re-election fight coming up.   Senator Murray is also on Senate 
Appropriations.  Both are on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, 
which funds OPS.

It is quite likely that the Senators will make a push to get increases in the 
OPS budget for FY 2001 that would enable the kinds of reforms contemplated by 
their stand-alone legislation (more state funding, more inspectors, more 
R&D).  Much of this increase would be funded through increases in user fees.  
INGAA indicates that it expects we could be facing increases in the range of 
10-15% from FY2000.   There is also the possibility that an attempt will be 
made to add legislative riders to the OPS appropriations -- such as requiring 
OPS to mandate inspections, increase operator qualifications, or allow 
increased state authority.   I would predict that legislative riders can be 
prevented, but it will be very difficult to avoid some kind of increases 
(beyond mere adjustments for inflation) in the OPS budget and user fees.  

The reauthorization will indeed receive attention in 2000, but our advocacy 
efforts will clearly need to be focused on the appropriations process, in 
order to minimize the impact on interstate pipeline user fees and prevent 
other harmful mandates.  

We will continue to work with key members of the authorizing and 
appropriations committees to ensure that the interstate natural gas 
perspective is clearly heard and, if possible, we avoid being dragged down in 
attempts to impose more strict regulation on liquids and LDCs.

Please let me know if you have questions or require additional information.  
Thank you."
1135,"Laine:

Having reviewed Abe's and Eduardo's comments on the joint security assessment 
report, I would like to provide my comments:

The things you should look at doing:

1. Get the government involved in enforcing the laws and stopping the illegal 
behavior.  Let the government decide how to do that - whether through the 
national police or the military.  ""Get the government involved"" is not quite 
the same as ""bring in the Army"" - although that may be a part of the final 
decision.  Pointing out to the government that the project is important to 
Bolivia as well at to Enron/Shell may help to get them off dead center.

2. Expand your PR program to include education of the people about illegal 
acts and their consequences.  Obviously if the government doesn't want to get 
involved, there won't be any consequences and in that case you might as well 
skip this step.  You may already have assets in place to do this - the CLO's 
and Jose Castro of GOB(?).  A little more push with the local civic committee 
to get them to accept your bringing in an outside member.

3. Consider bringing in outside security people from Santa Cruz (Wackenhut 
can get you national police on contract) to ride 'shotgun' on the vehicles 
and protect work sites and offices, if you feel a physical threat exists to 
your employees.  The cost will be high, as you will have to provide housing, 
food and transportation in addition to salary.  This would help in reducing 
the number of 'carjackings' of your vehicles and threats to your employees.  
This might, however, have a negative impact overall, and the confrontations 
may turn violent if the youth organization won't back down from a fight.  
Escalation at this point in the construction might lead to a longer 
completion time than if you just 'go with the flow'.  In my opinion, I would 
use this only if the government doesn't get involved in crime suppression 
activities.

4. Refuse to continue paying extortion to the populace.  Bear in mind, 
however, that this decision will probably escalate future incidents, with 
results equivilent to those mentioned above in #3.

The above are my immediate recommendations - the below are my general 
comments:

- I think the problem is more than just the 'PR issue' that the report seems 
to indicate.  There are illegal acts being committed, in violation of 
Bolivian laws, by a populace who is used to doing things their own way, 
without the benefit of following laws made by the government far away who 
doesn't take an active interest in crime suppression.  The only remedy for 
committing illegal acts is punishment for the offender, which sends a message 
to the community that illegal acts will not be condoned.  Can Enron punish 
the offender?  No - that can only come from the government through their 
legal system.  Enron should not be required to submit to extortion by groups 
committing illegal acts.  Enron's push here should be to get the government 
involved at whatever level it takes to investigate and prosecute those 
committing the illegal acts.  

- You have a short time frame to work in before the project is complete.  
Putting things in motion now wouldn't guarantee they would be in place before 
the end of the project - however, the operator of the pipeline is going to 
have to face these or similar issues - they are not going to go away just 
because the pipeline is finished.  The acceptance by the general populace of 
use of illegal acts can easily become a breeding ground for future sabotage 
of the pipeline, kidnapping of employees and contractors.  Whatever 
short-term solution you use will affect the long-term security of the 
pipeline, and needs to be well considered.  Whatever other options you have, 
education of the people probably wouldn't hurt.  If the operator of the PL 
can get involved in the education of the populace, it would be in it's best 
interest to do so.

- Your subcontractor, Conduto, seems to be a focal point for at least some of 
the problems through their non-use of local labor.  There is no indication in 
the report or in Abe's comments that the local populace are qualified for 
available jobs.    Maybe a lesson learned for next project - try to use local 
labor where possible (and qualified).  This friction - between Conduto and 
the populace - seems to be the major issue.

- The CLO concept, as I understand Abe's comments, seems to be on the right 
track, but maybe their responsibility should be expanded to include educating 
the populace that there is a difference in nogotiating for something in good 
faith rather than under duress.  Also that Illegal acts will not be 
tolerated.  One potential problem I see is that if GOB refuses to negotiate 
over future issues (wants of the people), then, without the education part of 
it in place, you will probably see sabotage on the PL or of company vehicles, 
and possibly violence against your employees.  Obviously you want to continue 
to use people such as Jose Castro - possibly expanding his role to include 
education issues.

In any case, this is not a problem that is going to go away overnight, and 
any actions you take at this point may not have a positive effect by the time 
the project is complete.  Hindsight is always better - maybe for the next 
project we will consider a due diligence assessment of the areas our pipe 
will pass through and see if similar conditions exist there.

Hope to see you before long.

Regards,

Mike Hicks

California Stiffs Gore's Hatchet Men  

California's state controller, Democrat Kathleen Connell,  says she won't 
sign any checks for those $30,000-a-month Gore hatchet men hired  by bumbling 
Gov. Gray Davis to try to blame others for the state's energy  fiasco.  

""I would like assurance that their work is directly related to solving  
California's energy crisis and not the political strategy that [Mark] 
Fabiani  and [Chris] Lehane have built a reputation for through their work at 
the White  House,"" Connell said, Fox News reported today.  

Connell says she supports a lawsuit filed Monday in Sacramento by Lewis  
Uhler, president of National Tax Limitation Committee, to block ""consultant""  
fees to the two former advisers to failed presidential candidate Al Gore.  

""They have a conflict of interest that may be terminal to their employment,""  
Uhler said. ""These are clearly not electricity experts. Their background  
suggests they have been hired to be damage control folks for a beleaguered  
governor."""
1146,"1. I appreciate everyone who participated in the call today.  I think that 
the discussion proved that we can find consensus on a reasonable approach for 
transmission pricing and energy markets.

2. To make more clear about the Regional Plans, I think that we need to 
consider the following.

A. BACKGROUND

Timelines of Current Process
Current Players & Current Positions
Allies 
Key Issues now facing the process

B. MOVING FORWARD

Top Issues upcoming
External Factors (e.g., will Entergy join SPP)
Resource Needs
Relationship to Commercial Objectives / Business Plans

C. OTHER ISSUES / CONCLUSION

I hope this helps set an outline for the Regional Plans.  The key idea is 
that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and 
what issues need to be addressed.  Don't be shy about adding other topics and 
issues.  We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the 
commercial people.  I don't expect this to be easy, but I think that it will 
be helpful.

3. I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure.  This 
would entail developing four things (1) a tariff, (2) ISO Systems & 
Procedures, (3) Day Ahead PX Energy Market, (4) Transmission Flowgate PX 
Market.  These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace.

My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using 
""off the shelf"" material.  I know that Tom Delaney has already started 
working on a tariff.  I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point 3.  
We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point 4.  On the ISO, maybe 
we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope / Work Plan and fees on setting 
up an ISO (including costs of operation over time).  It would make sense to 
me to do this very formally (including setting energy market zones and 
defining the commercially significant Flowgates).  I would use the MISO as 
the market to focus on, but am willing to listen to other thoughts.

Please let me know what everyone thinks.

Here's a quick run down on activities from last week:

Enron Center:
Working with Clark and Hines to establish consensus on estimated 
""floor-by-floor"" occupancy schedule, given present progress of base building 
work.
Received subcontractor bids on tenant improvements, levels 3-9.  Bids are 
very competitive and within budget targets.
Established bi-weekly meetings with Phillipe and IT team to co-ordinate 
responsibilities, schedules, and budgets.
Setting up ""trading desk"" mock-ups/competition between leading furniture 
makers.  Selection Committee involves top executives from ENA, EGM, and 
Networks.
Meeting with EES to discuss contractual relationship with Corp. for energy 
infrastructure management of Enron Center when operational next year
Working with Global Strategic Sourcing and Enron's ""DealBench"" team to buy 
Enron Center's carpet, lights, and ceiling system through their ""reverse 
auction"" internet platform.

EI Asset Sale:  ""On hold"" pending word from Corp. Development.  Issues 
outstanding include 3AC office space and corporate aircraft.  We are also 
holding on sublease with Azurix for their 3AC space, should EI's space needs 
impact Azurix.

We are cancelling our contract with Barton, our present Enron Building's 
outsourced security company.  Replacement vendor, Wackenhut, is on site with 
transition team.

Met with Bob McClaren of the Astros.  Purpose was to explore Enron's interest 
in development opportunities around Enron Field, given their present 
disposition to ask us to not build the proposed garage.

1152,"Major activities we have been working on include:
 
 1. Equity selldown issue - Trakya, India
  We have met with OPIC and EXIM and requested that they develop policies to 
guide proposed selldown considerations 
 2.  Azurix - Buenos Aires province water financing.  We have spent 
considerable time with azurix and the lending institutions getting all 
parties geared up for   fall Board consideration 
 3.  Cuiaba
  Conservation program - Woeking in 'washington to resolve concerns about the 
CFCP.
  Cuiaba II - siting of compression station issues.  I am insisting on an 
engineering report that demonstrates the efforts we have made to avoid 
putting compressor stations in the sensitive areas.  Then we will need a 
thorough consultation internally to decide the best way to present our 
conclusions not only to the NGO community but also to our friends who have 
supported us on Cuiaba.
 4.  OPIC in Mexico
  W are working with OPIC to develop a program enabling OPIC to move into 
Mexico.  Scott is working with Max Iziguirre to identify potential project   
leads
 5.  DR - IFC Default.  On June 15 we defaulted on the IFC loan.  We are 
ramping up a campaign to put pressure on the DR in this regard."

1158,"This afternoon the Commission has issued an Order Requesting Comments in the 
SDG&E and LA Dept. of Water & Power petition proceedings on the short term 
capacity release price cap (RP01-180, RP01-222).

The order requests comments on ""whether...[to] reimpose the maximum rate 
ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions into California and the 
effects of such action on the California gas market.""  Order and attachment 
are attached at the bottom of this email.  Print to read all footnotes 
(original came in WordPerfect).

Note that in footnote 2, the order explains the current comprehensive 
Commission approach to the gas market in California, and that they're 
reaching out for the gray market:  ""On May 18, 2001, in Docket No. 
RM01-9-000, the Commission issued an order proposing to impose certain 
reporting requirements on natural gas sellers and transporters serving the 
California market.  The proposed reporting requirements are intended to 
provide the Commission with the necessary information to determine what 
action, if any, it should take within its jurisdiction.  Our order today 
coupled with our May 18 order continues to focus on issues related to natural 
gas prices in California and actions we may take to address capacity release 
transactions and bundled sales (i.e., the ""gray market"").""

To note in this order, the discussion includes an explanation that FERC 
Staff's analysis of capacity release data between Nov. 2000 and April 2001 
shows that only .09 to 1.2 percent of the volume of capacity releases into CA 
were above the maximum tariff rate.  In light of this information, the order 
requests comment on whether the price cap into California would be reimposed 
on short term releases prior to Sept. 30, 2002.

Comments are due in  20 days.  Questions asked in the order are:  (1) Would 
reimposition of the maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release 
transactions into California have any significant effect on the price of gas 
at the California border; (2) Should the reimposition of the maximum rate 
ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions be limited to California 
or extended to pipelines delivering into the Western Systems Coordinating 
Council (WSCC) region; (3) What effect do capacity release transactions have 
on wholesale electric prices; (4) What would be the effect of reimposing the 
maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions into 
California given firm shippers' ability to make bundled sales at the 
California border; and (5) How will reimposing the maximum rate ceiling for 
short-term capacity release transactions into California impact shippers' 
ability to obtain short-term firm capacity.

An excel attachment to the order details the Staff findings on Transportation 
Release Transactions above the max. rate Nov. 2000 - April 2001

The CDWR idea has already been implemented. Today the ISO couldn't get supply 
from the market and informed market participants that CDWR would sleeve deals 
to the ISO. This occurred at a time when CA was in Stage 3 emergency (only 
the second one ever) and anticipating rolling blackouts this evening. Enron 
and other suppliers began to aggregate supply to sell to CDWR presumably to 
go to the ISO.  Belden was concerned that Gray Davis may just withhold 
payment through CDWR when settlements are due. This concern prompted us to 
require paper confirms for hourly deals and a discussion between Christian 
Yoder and Steve Hall (Stoel Rives) with the assistant director at CDWR to 
make sure CDWR management was on board - which they confirmed verbally. 
Regardless of all of this we still have some paranoia about getting paid. Is 
Gray Davis willing to confirm that no payment issue through CDWR will occur? 
We are currently continuing to aggregate supply through the day but are 
hesitant to increase quantities without such assurance. Other suppliers 
appeared hesitant as well as they wouldn't sleeve the deals to CDWR."

This is not very illustrative example. Utilities (ENEL distcos and 
municipalities) will not be allowed to sign long-term supply contracts with 
producers (ENEL gensets or divested ENEL gensets). Even, according to the 
last draft of market design recently published by the regulator, the single 
buyer will also need to procure power for non-eligibles through the 
forthcoming pool.

ENEL's divestiture has rather more to be with limiting market power and 
spurring competition than securing supplies.

This could be more helpful. Here, the dominant SEP (public sector, ie, tied 
gencos and tied customers) security of supply is based on a rock-sodlid 
long-term power purchase agreements. The SEP is characterised by long-term 
contracts between REN (the TSO), public and private (vgr. Pego, owned by 
National Power, Endesa, EdF and EdP) gencos and the four EdP's distributors. 
Individual power purchase agreements are concluded for each plant, and cover 
the plant's entire economic lives and commit gencos to sell to REN 
exlcusively. 

New power plants to be dedicated to SEP will be open to tender, according to 
a central planning. REN buys power from these tied gencos at each plant's 
costs and sell to the distcos at a uniform rate, the bulk supply tariff (BST).

Unfortunately, the record of the tendering process open to private investors 
is not either long or very transparent, and we could not draw many good 
lessons from this. For example, EdP has been trying in the last two years to 
build additional capacity for SEP without a tendering procedure.

1168,"Steve, Rob Hemstock  will give you the details of the Alberta PPA auction.
The only other auction type mechansims of which I am aware in Canada  with
respect to power supply are the following:
a) Ontario electricity
distributors have the  choice of purchasing power  for their default
service customers ( called ""standard supply customers"" here) either
directly from the IMO real-time market or from a third party supplier.  If
the distributor chooses to secure power from a third party supplier the
distributor must employ a formal, transparent and auditible RFP process.
Many Ontario distributors may opt for third party supply precisely because
they want to avoid  cash flow problems comparable to those facing the
California IOUs - that is, if an Ontario distributor chooses to buy
directly from the real time spot market, it must supply that power to
default customers at a  rate fixed by the provincial regulator - the
Ontario Energy Board (""OEB"") -  and record the difference between the
purchase cost and the rates charged in a deferral account.  The amount in
the deferral account will be debited or credited to customers periodically.
However,   the  OEB has fixed the default service rate too low and,
accordingly, distributors opting for supply  directly from the IMO real
time spot market may face very serious cash flow problems.  The term of the
third party supply that may be secured in this fashion is unclear, but as
matters stand in Ontario there may be significant regulatory risk in
securing supply more than 1 year out.  (This was the first issue in respect
of which Enron retained Seabron Adamson and Seab knows the issue well);

b) An auction/RFP  process is also included in the
""restructuring"" plan recently adopted by the Quebec National Assembly in
respect of Hydro Quebec.  The key features of that plan are the following:
1) a  long term vesting contract between HQ Generation and HQ Distribution
under which HQ Generation is obliged to supply HQ Distribution up to 165
twh annually;  and 2) the requirement that HQ Generation secure any supply
it needs over and above the vested amount  through an RFP process to be
approved by le Regie ( the provincial regulator).

Bush Formally Nominates New SEC Chair,
Tapping Former General Counsel Harvey Pitt

President Bush formally nominated Washington lawyer Harvey Pitt July 10 to 
become the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a 
spokesman for the Senate Banking Committee confirmed that day. 
Pitt, a partner in Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, served as 
general counsel of the SEC from 1975 to 1978 before entering private 
practice. The White House said May 10 that it would nominate Pitt to head the 
agency. 
Pitt's nomination will be considered by the Senate Banking Committee, which 
is headed by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.), before it can be voted on by the 
full Senate. The committee spokesman told BNA that no confirmation hearing 
has yet been scheduled. 
If confirmed by the Senate, Pitt would serve the remainder of a five-year 
term expiring June 5, 2003. He would succeed Arthur Levitt, a Democrat, who 
chaired the SEC for seven and a half years before stepping down in February. 
Levitt was the longest serving SEC chairman in the agency's 67-year history. 

Large Law Practice

Since Levitt's departure, Commissioner Laura Unger has served as the 
commission's acting chairman. Currently, Unger and Commissioner Isaac Hunt 
are the only two members of the SEC. 
At Fried Frank, Pitt has developed one of the country's largest and best 
known securities law practices. He has represented securities industry groups 
and companies in dispute with the SEC. However, Pitt is perhaps most renowned 
for having served as defense counsel to the notorious Ivan Boesky at the time 
of the Wall Street insider trading scandals in the late 1980s and early 
1990s. 
Pitt received a J.D. from St. John's University Law School and is a graduate 
of City University of New York, Brooklyn College. 
In May, news of the president's intention to nominate Pitt sparked seemingly 
universal praise by key members of Congress, regulators, the securities bar, 
and the securities industry. 
In response to the formal nomination, the Senate Banking Committee's ranking 
Republican member, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), issued a statement saying, ""Mr. 
Pitt has few peers in his depth of experience in the operation of America's 
securities markets and the impact of the laws and regulations which protect 
investors."" Gramm said he looked forward to ""timely consideration"" of Pitt's 
nomination. 
At the same time, Securities Industry Association President Marc Lackritz 
said of Pitt in a statement, ""I believe that under his leadership, the SEC 
will be an effective advocate for efficient, fair, competitive, and 
well-regulated U.S. capital markets."" The association's general counsel, 
Stuart Kaswell remarked that ""there is no one with a more in-depth knowledge 
of securities law,"" and said that Pitt will do ""a great job representing 
investors' interests.""

1174,"Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Long-Term Power Contracts Present Dilemma for Utilities Energy: They see 
risks in proposals by electricity- generating firms if wholesale rates were 
to drop significantly.
CHRIS KRAUL
? 
09/28/2000 
Los Angeles Times 
Home Edition 
Page C-1 
Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company 
California electricity users just can't seem to buy a break. 
After a summer of sky-high wholesale prices that briefly socked the bill to 
consumers in San Diego, various power marketers have come forward with a deal 
for the state's big utilities: Sign long-term contracts for electricity, at 
one-third to one-half current prices, and everybody goes home happy. 
But utilities and independent power generators have yet to sign such 
bilateral contracts despite industry assurances that the deals could offer a 
way out of the state's continuing electricity crisis. 
The aversion of utilities to the contracts' risks, regulatory uncertainty and 
the unsettled energy market overall are cited as causing the stalemate. In 
any case, the standoff is yet another sign that the deregulated California 
electricity market isn't working as expected, with residents, small 
businesses and utility shareholders the ultimate losers. 
Power merchants, which complain that they have been cast as heavies and as 
market manipulators during the summer-long electricity crunch, say the 
contracts they have offered to utilities illustrate how they are putting 
""solutions on the table,"" as one executive put it, that so far have not been 
picked up. 
Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International, and PG&E Corp.'s 
Pacific Gas & Electric received permission from regulators last month to sign 
long-term contracts to buy energy directly from generators and bypass the 
California Power Exchange, where wholesale prices soared this summer on 
higher-than-expected demand and generation shortages throughout the West. 
San Diego Gas & Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy, got a green light to sign 
such bilateral ""forward"" contracts last week. The utility's 1.2 million 
customers suffered through a summer of doubled and tripled bills before price 
caps were enacted last month; retail prices in Edison and PG&E territory 
remain frozen under terms of the state's landmark 1996 regulation bill. 
Those limits on rates have saddled the utilities with $5 billion in 
uncollectable costs--the difference between the skyrocketing wholesale rates 
and the prices they can pass along to consumers. Doubts surrounding whether 
the utilities will recoup any of that growing deficit is causing increased 
nervousness on Wall Street. 
On Wednesday, Edison International shares plunged $3.19, or 14%, to $19.88 on 
the New York Stock Exchange in heavy trading, as investors focused on the 
risks the company faces in borrowing to cover power costs. The stock now has 
slumped 24% from its recent high. 
PG&E Corp. slid $1.92 to $25.39 on Wednesday, extending its loss to 20% from 
its recent high, also on concerns about its borrowing needs. 
After the state's Public Utilities Commission authorized bilateral contracts, 
power merchants including Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc. and Dynegy 
Inc. came forward, offering to supply power to the utilities at fractions of 
the going wholesale rate. 
The power merchants have been touting energy as cheap as $50 per 
megawatt-hour in contracts spread over one to five years. That would seem to 
offer big savings over the average Power Exchange electricity price so far 
this month of $122 per megawatt-hour and the $166 average for 
August--dramatic spikes upward from the $40 average of August 1999. 
Why, then, have no deals been cut? 
Edison and SDG&E say that the Public Utilities Commission's right of review 
would create huge potential liabilities for their shareholders if wholesale 
electricity prices were to fall. 
The risk is that prices on the Power Exchange could drop significantly 18 to 
24 months from now, when added generation capacity coming online in 
California should ease shortages. That could leave utilities paying more 
under contracts than on the open market. 
""The PUC could look at the transactions, find them to be imprudent, say the 
difference between the contract price and Power Exchange price was the cost 
of our actions, and then try to recover the difference from shareholders,"" 
said Kevin Cini, Southern California Edison's manager of energy supply and 
marketing. 
The PUC could possibly take such action any time the contract price turns out 
to be more than a 5% ""safe harbor band"" above the average Power Exchange 
wholesale price over the life of the contract. ""We think the safe harbor 
should be 20%,"" Cini said. 
A source at the PUC--some of whose members have been against bilateral 
contracts on grounds they distort the workings of the Power Exchange--said 
the utilities want a ""blank check"" to make deals and bypass the commission's 
mandated oversight role in setting retail electricity rates. 
""The utilities don't want any constraints on what they can do,"" said a PUC 
administrative source who asked not to be identified. ""They don't want the 
PUC to take a retroactive review and say this was unreasonable and disallow 
some costs, nor do they want pre-approval and be subjected to review."" 
Industry observers say that the PUC's right to review all contracts longer 
than two years hamstrings the utilities' ability to hedge their risks in the 
volatile state energy market. 
""The utilities can judge the risks. What we need is the PUC to allow the 
utilities to enter into these deals without the second chance of looking at 
them,"" said Greg Blue, senior director of Dynegy, a Houston-based power 
merchant that owns several power plants in Southern California. 
Regulators and consumer advocates, meanwhile, are concerned that allowing the 
utilities to sign contracts for supply represents a merchant role they 
relinquished under deregulation. 
Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer 
watchdog, said the utilities could someday lose some of their retail customer 
base, ""leaving the remaining customers to pay contracts costing more than 
what was available on the spot market."" 
Stanford professor Blake Johnson believes the California wholesale market 
will one day ""settle out"" as a mixture of short-term contracts on the Power 
Exchange and long-term bilateral deals. Until then, he said, he can see the 
risks on both sides of the issue. 
""When the house is on fire,"" he said, ""it's not the right time to buy the 
insurance policy.""

1202,"Wholesale electric prices soar anew 
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer 
(Published Dec. 13, 2000)

With wholesale prices again soaring on California's biggest power-trading 
market, grid operators called the year's 30th ""stage two"" electric emergency 
Tuesday. 
One consumer group estimated that if those prices continued and were passed 
along to ratepayers, the average Californian's electric bill would be $620 in 
December. 
Electric rates are currently frozen, although Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
and Southern California Edison are fighting in federal court and before the 
state Public Utilities Commission to end the freeze and pass along their 
costs. 
Although prices reached $1,500 a megawatt-hour Tuesday on the California 
Power Exchange, where most of the state's electricity is traded, problems 
with new trading rules drove the average price much lower. 
The issue, which revolves around how prices should be revised to reflect 
space crunches on transmission lines, is fueling anxiety between two 
California power agencies, the PX and the Independent System Operator, which 
runs the transmission grid. 
On Tuesday, the glitch produced two sets of prices -- an average of $1,182 a 
megawatt-hour before the transmission calculations dropped it to $258. 
One year ago, the average PX price was about $30. 
The issue is expected to simmer at least until Friday, when the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission will consider the state's electricity chaos. 
Meanwhile, Tuesday's wholesale costs fueled more calls to re-regulate 
electricity. 
""The prices that we're seeing are so out of whack ... it's just obscene,"" 
said Doug Heller, a consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and 
Consumer Rights, which promises a 2002 ballot initiative on the issue. 
As the ISO declared a ""stage two"" emergency Tuesday and called for continuing 
efforts to conserve electricity, the agency's chief operating officer, Kellan 
Fluckiger, predicted that more power could soon be available. 
Power plants capable of generating 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts are expected back 
on line by the end of the week, Fluckiger said. 
By week's end, only about 7,000 megawatts of capacity might be off line, he 
said, compared with 11,000 megawatts last week.

COLOMBIA: Colombia sets new date for key utility privatization.
12/13/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

BOGOTA, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The embattled Colombian government on Wednesday 
set a deadline of June 30 next year for its often delayed privatization of 
state-run power generator ISAGEN. 
The 1,636 megawatt generator, the country's third-largest and valued at about 
$450 million, was most recently due to have been sold by Sept. 30 as part of 
a year-old plan agreed with the International Monetary Fund to help boost 
government revenues and meet tight budget targets.
But it was delayed indefinitely until just last week when the Council of 
State - a tribunal set up to resolve disputes between the government and 
private sector - struck down an injunction blocking the sale that was based 
on a complaint from Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), Colombia's largest 
public utility. 
EPM has argued that it has been unfairly excluded from the bidding process 
for ISAGEN by government regulators, on grounds that its ownership of the 
company would violate antitrust laws by giving it a virtual monopoly over 
Colombia's power generating capacity. 
Finance Minister Juan Manuel Santos said in September that the government was 
determined to finalize the ISAGEN sell-off by the end of this year, once the 
Council of State ruled as expected in the government's favor. 
But Santos, who spoke to reporters as he emerged from a cabinet meeting at 
the presidential palace, said legal loopholes, possible changes in the 
price-tag for ISAGEN, and the need to update paperwork related to its 
privatization would now postpone the deal until June 30. 
""We have to restart this whole process. We're going to study the valuation 
and reopen negotiations with possible buyers to see how we can put ISAGEN up 
for sale at the best price as soon as possible,"" Santos said. 
The sale of ISAGEN, considered one of the crown jewels in the government's 
troubled privatization program, had originally been expected to take place 
last December. It was later slated for the first half of 2000, at a time when 
government sources said leading bidders included U.S. energy group Enron . 
The sell-off in the first half of this year was delayed, until the elusive 
Sept. 30 deadline, amid a flurry of attacks on the national power grid by 
Marxist rebel saboteurs and legal challenges to the sale from ISAGEN's own 
labor union.

2:58 (Dow Jones) As credit quality concerns dog investors, Bear Stearns' 
analyst Amy Butte says in a report Wednesday that investment banks are 
increasing liquidity to historically high levels, which could be a sign of 
either a more conservative bent or a premonition of risk, she said. (CWM)
2:48 (Dow Jones) Gridlock may put some of Bush's measures, such as school 
vouchers and Social Security privatization, on hold. But rebel Democrats may 
help pass all or most of Bush's tax cuts, says economist Ian Morris at HSBC. 
That wouldn't prevent hard landing in 2001, but the stimulus will be felt by 
2002. By 2003, Morris says, the surplus could be more like $250 billion than 
CBO's projected $400 billion. (SV) 
2:39 (Dow Jones) OK, so it wasn't an unprecedented ruling that determined our 
next president, but there was a big ruling in the HMO arena concerning 
provider lawsuits. Chase H&Q calls judge's decision granting certain parts 
and denying other parts of various defendant's motions a minor victory for 
HMOs. Ruling positive for Wellpoint (WLP) and Aetna (AET), mildly positive 
for Cigna (CI) and United Healthcare (UNH), mixed for PacifiCare (PHSY), and 
has no impact on Humana (HUM). (TG) 
2:30 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps, which have spent all day in negative territory, 
are focusing on the fundamentals now that the election outcome is more 
certain. And the fundamentals don't look too bullish, given the earnings 
warnings of recent days, particularly from computer and chip-makers, 
off-floor traders say. ""We probably won't be heading any higher tomorrow than 
where we are today,"" he said. (ZHS) 
2:20 (Dow Jones) The intraday low for Toronto's TSE 300 Index is 9103.95, 
practically significant weekly support at 9103.64. The index is now pointed 
up to about 9500 at least, if the intraday low holds. A daily close below 
9103.64 means that the index is headed back to to the lower 8500 handle. (SC) 
2:15 (Dow Jones) Lehman's Jeff deGraaf says that while he is not a big fan of 
energy names currently, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock (UDS) has one of the best 
looking charts in the sector. Nice base off which to rally, and shares are 
above both 50-day and 200-day moving average. Stop under $26. (TG) 
2:00 (Dow Jones) Tough day for Applied Materials (AMAT) and semi group. 
Salomon, Merrill downgrade AMAT, and Prudential lowers estimates on company 
and several other semiconductor names. Pru also has an ""implied trough value"" 
for semi companies, and they're not pretty: AMAT $28-$27, KLAC $20-$26, KLIC 
$8, LRCX $14-$18, NVLS $22-$31, and TER $15-$30. (TG) 
1:45 (Dow Jones) Celestica (CLS) and NEC Corp. (NIPNY) could be about to hook 
up again. TD Securities analyst Mark Lucey says Celestica is looking for 
regulatory approval to buy a unit of NEC in the U.K. This after NEC said 
Tuesday it is in talks to sell its mobile phone production facilities in the 
U.K. and Mexico. In June, Celestica acquired NEC's manufacturing plant in 
Brazil as part of a five-year, $1.2 billion supply agreement. In addition, 
Nokia is looking to move into Brazil and said it will use Celestica to 
manufacture GSM wireless base stations after securing contract wins, 
according to Lucey. (SEW) 
1:43 (Dow Jones) Said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Austin, Tex.: 
""With a mere one-person majority of the Court and a definiite minority of the 
national vote, President-elect Bush is off to a tough start. All of us have a 
stake in the success of his presidency. Now is the time to join with him, 
without foresaking principle, to seek common ground in addressing the 
nation's needs."" (JC) 
1:29 (Dow Jones) The chance of a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting next week 
is modest, but on the rise and helping to fuel Tsys gains, says bond 
strategist. Fed Funds futures showing 15% to 20% chance of rate cut on Dec. 
19, strategist says. 30-year now at session high, up 22/32 at 111 3/32, yield 
down 4 bp at 5.49%. (JNP) 
1:22 (Dow Jones) Prudential Vector analyst Timothy Anderson lowered Alza 
(AZA) to accumulate from strong buy because of valuation. With positive 
prescription trends for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medicine 
Concerta and strong market shares of overactive bladder treatment Ditropan 
XL, Anderson said Alza shares are ""priced for perfection and expectations are 
high - any slight upset could weigh heavily on the stock."" Shares fell about 
8.5%. (BMM) 
1:13 (Dow Jones) Online and discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) sees 
meeting the 14 cents that analysts expected for its fourth quarter earnings 
per share as a challenge, unless there is a big surge in trading activity or 
the firm cuts costs sharply. Schwab shares are off 2.7%. (GFC) 
1:10 (Dow Jones) Enron's (ENE) current chief executive and chairman, Kenneth 
Lay, says he categorically won't be taking a job in a new presidential 
administration. ""I have no plans to go to Washington, and no plans to leave 
Houston or Enron. I can say categorically that I won't be taking a job in a 
Bush cabinet,"" Lay said in an interview. (MPG) 
1:07 (Dow Jones) Vlasic Foods International (VL) apparently has received bids 
for both the entire company and individual parts, according to Merrill 
Lynch's Len Teitelbaum. The troubled pickle maker has been on the block since 
March. Teitelbaum says a deadline of Feb. 28 has been set by the banks 
involved. He estimates stockholders could reap proceeds of 89 cents to $1.00 
a share at the completion of a sale. Teitelbaum is convinced that ""the main 
objective of (Vlasic's) management now is to make the bondholder whole."" As a 
result, the analyst no longer maintains an investment opinion on the stock.

2:20 (Dow Jones) The intraday low for Toronto's TSE 300 Index is 9103.95, 
practically significant weekly support at 9103.64. The index is now pointed 
up to about 9500 at least, if the intraday low holds. A daily close below 
9103.64 means that the index is headed back to to the lower 8500 handle. (SC)
2:15 (Dow Jones) Lehman's Jeff deGraaf says that while he is not a big fan of 
energy names currently, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock (UDS) has one of the best 
looking charts in the sector. Nice base off which to rally, and shares are 
above both 50-day and 200-day moving average. Stop under $26. (TG) 
2:00 (Dow Jones) Tough day for Applied Materials (AMAT) and semi group. 
Salomon, Merrill downgrade AMAT, and Prudential lowers estimates on company 
and several other semiconductor names. Pru also has an ""implied trough value"" 
for semi companies, and they're not pretty: AMAT $28-$27, KLAC $20-$26, KLIC 
$8, LRCX $14-$18, NVLS $22-$31, and TER $15-$30. (TG) 
1:45 (Dow Jones) Celestica (CLS) and NEC Corp. (NIPNY) could be about to hook 
up again. TD Securities analyst Mark Lucey says Celestica is looking for 
regulatory approval to buy a unit of NEC in the U.K. This after NEC said 
Tuesday it is in talks to sell its mobile phone production facilities in the 
U.K. and Mexico. In June, Celestica acquired NEC's manufacturing plant in 
Brazil as part of a five-year, $1.2 billion supply agreement. In addition, 
Nokia is looking to move into Brazil and said it will use Celestica to 
manufacture GSM wireless base stations after securing contract wins, 
according to Lucey. (SEW) 
1:43 (Dow Jones) Said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Austin, Tex.: 
""With a mere one-person majority of the Court and a definiite minority of the 
national vote, President-elect Bush is off to a tough start. All of us have a 
stake in the success of his presidency. Now is the time to join with him, 
without foresaking principle, to seek common ground in addressing the 
nation's needs."" (JC) 
1:29 (Dow Jones) The chance of a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting next week 
is modest, but on the rise and helping to fuel Tsys gains, says bond 
strategist. Fed Funds futures showing 15% to 20% chance of rate cut on Dec. 
19, strategist says. 30-year now at session high, up 22/32 at 111 3/32, yield 
down 4 bp at 5.49%. (JNP) 
1:22 (Dow Jones) Prudential Vector analyst Timothy Anderson lowered Alza 
(AZA) to accumulate from strong buy because of valuation. With positive 
prescription trends for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medicine 
Concerta and strong market shares of overactive bladder treatment Ditropan 
XL, Anderson said Alza shares are ""priced for perfection and expectations are 
high - any slight upset could weigh heavily on the stock."" Shares fell about 
8.5%. (BMM) 
1:13 (Dow Jones) Online and discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) sees 
meeting the 14 cents that analysts expected for its fourth quarter earnings 
per share as a challenge, unless there is a big surge in trading activity or 
the firm cuts costs sharply. Schwab shares are off 2.7%. (GFC) 
1:10 (Dow Jones) Enron's (ENE) current chief executive and chairman, Kenneth 
Lay, says he categorically won't be taking a job in a new presidential 
administration. ""I have no plans to go to Washington, and no plans to leave 
Houston or Enron. I can say categorically that I won't be taking a job in a 
Bush cabinet,"" Lay said in an interview. (MPG) 
1:07 (Dow Jones) Vlasic Foods International (VL) apparently has received bids 
for both the entire company and individual parts, according to Merrill 
Lynch's Len Teitelbaum. The troubled pickle maker has been on the block since 
March. Teitelbaum says a deadline of Feb. 28 has been set by the banks 
involved. He estimates stockholders could reap proceeds of 89 cents to $1.00 
a share at the completion of a sale. Teitelbaum is convinced that ""the main 
objective of (Vlasic's) management now is to make the bondholder whole."" As a 
result, the analyst no longer maintains an investment opinion on the stock. 
(VL) 
1:00 (Dow Jones) Tech boutique Thomas Weisel Partners reiterated its buy 
rating and raised its 2001 revenue projections for SonicWall (SNWL), to 
$125.2 million from $106.4 million, saying the computer firewall maker's 
acquisition of Phobos will boost market share in internal transaction 
security as well as traditional firewall appliances. ""Visibility and and 
business momentum continue to be strong,"" said analyst Mark Edelen. (MER) 
12:56 (Dow Jones) March Nasdaqs and S&Ps are incurring losses on 
profit-taking, said floor traders, who were intrigued by their fall even when 
it has become clear that Al Gore, whose defeat was seen as bullish for the 
stock futures market, is reportedly going to concede. ""There's no uncertainty 
left in the market,"" quipped one floor trader. (ZHS) 
12:40 (Dow Jones) Lehman opened up coverage on a passel of Internet 
infrastructure service companies, with an outperform rating on Digex (DIGX), 
Genuity (GENU) and InterNAP (INAP). Harry Blount is looking past current 
turbulence in the stocks to a time of ""powerful secular growth."" The 
companies, Blount says, ""have among the most compelling business models of 
any emerging growth sector in the stock market."" Among the pluses he cites 
are steady revenue, scalable business models and decreasing capital costs as 
the companies reach critical mass. 
12:21 (Dow Jones) Wounded Linux stocks rallying for second straight day after 
IBM CEO Gerstner said Tuesday that Big Blue would invest $1 billion next year 
commercializing the renegade operating system. After seeing their stocks drop 
as much as 95% this year, Red Hat (RHAT), VA Linux, (LNUX) and Caldera (CALD) 
are each up more than 20%. (MLP) 
12:14 (Dow Jones) Stanley Furniture's (STLY) 4Q sales and earns warning comes 
on same day that Commerce, in its retail sales report, said overall furniture 
sales surged 1.5% in Nov. - biggest monthly jump in about a year. Maybe 
coincidental, maybe a holiday phenom. But it's still interesting that sales

Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California
 Utilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations 
swelled and few new energy sources were developed. Now, also facing 
blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and 
toward themselves.


By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer


     WINTERSBURG, Ariz.--For more than a century, California ran a simple 
account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most 
especially water and power.
     But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade--in no small 
part because of an outbound trek of Californians--this simple, supply-demand 
relationship has broken down.
     Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system 
just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same 
way--by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation.
     Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have 
been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face 
the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden 
State.
     The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that 
its planning reserves--the extra power that utilities build in to handle 
emergencies--have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts 
consider dangerous.
     Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production 
at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. 
Despite the long economic boom of the 1990s, which smiled especially on the 
West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power 
plant.
     ""We don't know how bad it's going to be yet,"" said Utah's Republican 
governor, Mike Leavitt. ""We won't know that until May, June, July and August, 
when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers.""
     In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking 
to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic 
deal with California. They want to end an old relationship--that between 
center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized--and establish a new one that 
could curtail California's long regional dominance.
     In the strange chemistry of the moment--when a once-Republican state 
government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government 
has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately 
owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water--they could actually 
meet with some success.
     ""California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street 
and the East,"" said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a 
multivolume history of California. ""Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic 
possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the 
West.""

     Captive Plants Feed Power to California
     Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry 
scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, 
now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well 
to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will 
produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor.
     Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of 
regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California 
once maintained with the rest of the West.
     More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal 
utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities 
and Southern California Edison.
     A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a 
transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a 
half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New 
Mexico.
     From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been 
that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state 
pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home.
     And at least until the mid-1990s, California regulators virtually 
guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if 
plants' power wasn't immediately needed.
     ""The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to 
meet demand, no matter what,"" said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility 
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
     ""If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was 
less important than being sure you could meet demand."" And, he added, ""you 
had regulators watching to make sure you did.""
     The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also 
representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. 
Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same 
California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different 
business premise: selling power to the highest bidder.
     In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an 
electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge 
transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out 
from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to 
Utah and from there to the Northwest.
     All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they 
are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar 
by sending power wherever prices are highest.
     ""It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the 
market to see if they could meet demand,"" said Jack Davis, president of 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is 
putting up two of the Wintersburg plants.
     ""Now,"" he said approvingly, ""it's being built by people who look at the 
market to see if you can make a lot of money.""

     Plans Go Awry in Many States
     Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to 
assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would 
cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of 
new power plants got built.
     If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who 
suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, 
more plants and, ultimately, more power.
     But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned--and 
not just in California, but in the West in general.
     Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, 
including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions 
blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs.
     Its population grew by 40% from 1990 to 2000, according to the Census 
Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, 
according to industry figures.
     ""Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven,"" said A. Michael 
Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent 
Washington-area consulting firm.
     But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 1990s, mostly 
as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had 
applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s.
     ""I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort 
of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon,"" Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull 
said in a recent interview. ""I think what we all worry about is: Are they 
planning?""
     Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased 
electricity-making capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44%. But 
that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 
66%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy 
company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state.
     Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major 
utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously 
planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then 
some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to 
handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital.
     But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional 
supplies are balanced on a ""razor's edge,"" according to Northwest Power Pool 
President Jerry Rust. ""We have no cushion.""
     Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a 
razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this 
summer.
     Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region 
will come up 6% short. ""Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling 
blackouts, most of them in California,"" he said.
     One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in 
contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just 
recently.
     They have been perilously tight for the last several years--before the 
start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the 
near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water 
for its hydroelectric dams.
     The implication is that California did not cause other states to run 
short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did 
that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver.
     When California required its major utilities to buy power in the 
volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along 
higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral.
     That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security 
blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively 
if local supplies proved inadequate.
     The result has been a string of crises across the West.
     In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a 
tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by 
dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the 
spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 300%. Most of the 
project's 13,300 poor customers say they can't pay.
     In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was 
rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 
50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable 
generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market.
     In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip 
planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps 
back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than 
purchasing power on the open market--and the potato farmers are likely to do 
pretty well themselves.

     Deep Hostility in Rest of the West
     The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and 
actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current 
atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the 
West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big 
neighbor, they are less guarded at home.
     The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as 
warning a Salt Lake City audience that ""California, if given the chance, 
would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly."" (In an 
interview, he denied having made the remark.)
     Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners 
that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, ""plundered 
provinces""--terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have 
regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power.
     But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. ""A 
lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with 
California to their advantage,"" said Stanford historian Richard White.
     The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West.
     In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling 
their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, 
federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that 
is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. 
     ""The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the 
region can be exported without the region's consent,"" Oregon Gov. John 
Kitzhaber said in an interview.
     In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new 
power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the 
construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are 
considering another eight.
     Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's 
needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for 
whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California 
just one among many bidders.
     (Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to 
President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic 
California.)
     Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, 
where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst 
nightmare--recalling power that Utah produces for the state.
     Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own 
three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in 
west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years.
     But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in 
their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with 
proper notice, to recall power for local use.
     The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 
megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, 
and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general 
manager Reed Searle.
     Although the amounts are trivial--the Los Angeles utility either owns or 
has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity--Leavitt said 
Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants 
in the state, including a 500- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is 
negotiating to build.
     ""California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has 
depended on us to do that,"" the Utah governor said. ""That's fine and we're 
willing to do that.
     ""But,"" he added, ""there comes a point at which, if demand grows too 
large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for 
our children and grandchildren.""
     If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California 
could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which 
it now suffers.

Bush Adviser Rove Owns Stock in Major U.S. Firms

Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- President Bush's chief political strategist owns hundreds of 
thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies potentially affected by the 
president's top legislative priorities, newly released federal records show. 
Karl Rove, one of the president's most trusted advisers on almost every major 
legislative initiative, owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of stock in Enron 
Corp., Pfizer Inc., General Electric Co., Boeing Co. and Johnson & Johnson, 
among other holdings. (Federal law requires public officials to report their 
assets, income and debts in broad ranges only). All of these companies could 
be affected by one or more of the policies or legislative initiatives on 
which the president consults Mr. Rove: tax cuts, increased defense spending, 
an industry-oriented energy policy and health-care reform.
Mr. Rove said yesterday that he has been waiting for several months for 
approval from the Office of Government Ethics to sell all of his stock 
holdings and roll the proceeds into a diversified account without having to 
pay capital-gains taxes, as permitted by federal law. In the meantime, ""I 
have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially 
affect my specific holdings,"" Mr. Rove said. 
Mr. Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec. 30 and was later 
informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his 
stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
But the government ethics office, which couldn't be reached for comment 
yesterday, has yet to officially grant Mr. Rove a certificate of divestiture, 
which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts, 
according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack. It appears that Mr. Rove 
has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most 
of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year. 
Mr. Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that 
directly affect companies he is invested in, as federal conflict-of-interest 
laws require. But that can't be easy for Mr. Rove, widely regarded as one of 
the most powerful and influential figures in the White House. Mr. Rove serves 
as the president's top political adviser and runs the administration's 
long-term strategy team. He is also the president's top liaison to outside 
groups, including corporations. 
""He's involved in virtually every decision that is made here,"" says a White 
House aide. It is unclear how many times, if ever, Mr. Rove recused himself 
from discussion inside the White House. 
President Bush, already under fire from Democrats for his administration's 
close ties to industry, is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the 
new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and 
major U.S. corporations, especially energy firms. 
The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr. Rove and several other 
top administration officials at the behest of the media. It appears that as a 
result of an administrative backlog, Mr. Rove is the only member of the 
senior staff who hasn't been given the green light to sell his stock, 
according to a White House aide. 
The reports show that Mr. Rove was one of several White House officials with 
a financial connection, past or present, with Enron and other energy 
companies. Larry Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser who helped 
draft the energy plan, received $50,000 from Enron in 2000 for consulting 
work he did for the company, the documents show. 
Lewis Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was chairman 
of the White House task force that wrote the energy plan, recently sold tens 
of thousands of dollars of stock in Enron and other energy companies, 
including Texaco Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. It is 
unclear when the transaction went through. 
Clay Johnson, director of presidential personnel, reported holding between 
$100,000 and $250,000 in El Paso Energy Partners LP. And National Security 
Adviser Condoleezza Rice had $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Chevron Corp. 
stock and was paid $60,000 last year for her work as a director at the 
company. Mr. Rove disclosed smaller holdings in BP PLC and Royal Dutch/Shell 
Group.

Saudi Arabia Sets Pacts With 9 Oil Firms

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine oil 
companies yesterday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in 
its energy sector since the industry was nationalized in the 1970s. 
The expected deal, valued at $25 billion at least, involves the development 
of three natural-gas fields in the kingdom, as well as a number of related 
power plants, transmission pipelines and water-desalinization projects.
Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the 
lead manager on two of the projects, including the $15 billion Ghawar Core 
Venture 1 project. It also will lead the Red Sea Coast Core Venture 2 
project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group was chosen to lead the Shaybah Core Venture 
3 project. 
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil 
burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil 
for export. 
The other companies selected were BP PLC, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc., 
Phillips Petroleum Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Enron Corp. and Marathon 
Oil Canada Inc. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity 
owner in the projects. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 after tension caused by the 
Arab oil embargo against the West that began two years earlier, and it closed 
its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Exxon Mobil has $5 billion 
in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country, and it said it 
is also the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons 
from Saudi Aramco.

JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine 
international oil companies Sunday, a move that marks the first major foreign 
investment in its energy sector since nationalizing the industry in 1975. 
The deals, worth a total of $25 billion or more, involve the development of 
three natural gas fields in the kingdom and a number of related power plants, 
transmission pipelines and water desalinization projects.
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from 
oil-burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude 
oil for export. 
Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the 
lead manager on two of the projects, including the $12-billion-to-$16-billion 
Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead a second core project. Royal 
Dutch/Shell was chosen to lead a third project. The last two projects have a 
value of $7 billion to $10 billion each, Prince Saud al Faisal told 
reporters. 
The other companies selected were BP of Britain, TotalFinaElf of France, 
Conoco Inc. of Houston, Phillips Petroleum Co. of Bartlesville, Okla., 
Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles, Enron Corp. of Houston and 
Marathon Oil Co. of Houston. 
Harry Longwell, director and senior vice president at Exxon Mobil, said the 
financial terms of the deal are still being discussed. But he said his 
company is ready to begin the work when the final contracts are signed. 
""The Saudis' expectations are extremely aggressive,"" Longwell said. ""It's a 
very tight schedule and in recognition of that, the ability to get this done 
is one of the key reasons we were chosen to lead two of these ventures. We 
already have a senior management team in place and are ready to go to work 
immediately."" 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi said the companies are expected to 
profit on returns from the exploration and development of gas fields with 
more than 15% of the investment cost. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity 
owner in the projects. 
Saud said if the companies discover oil, they will be compensated and the 
fields will be repossessed by Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 and closed its energy 
exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Irving, Texas-based Exxon 
Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the 
country and is the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other 
hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does 
not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, 
maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They 
can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and 
yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El 
Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the 
minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. 
Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and 
meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that 
their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the 
nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have 
trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping 
gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand 
that energy companies could create ""shortages"" whenever they wanted merely by 
closing plants for ""maintenance""? You bet we did. And did we confuse the 
energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to 
repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have 
busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is 
everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying 
bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit 
of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but 
don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we 
forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that 
credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using 
energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the 
river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing 
machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task 
at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but 
never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains 
in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You 
wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he 
can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social 
Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we 
kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional 
compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals 
under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get 
away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active 
villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a 
corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any 
extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We 
send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we 
see. And we await developments, or create them.

Please forgive the delay.  I was having trouble with my PC again (we have a 
replacement in the works).  We are discretely investigating this group a bit 
more, but the general conclusion is that they may be a front for one of the 
opposition groups.  We are preparing counter arguments for the general 
public, but do not see much value in opening a dialogue with this ""group.""  
We always have had opposition and we can expect that socialists etc. (some 
groups have boasted that they will storm the DPC fences on March 1) will 
begin to rally using us as a scapegoat for Maharashtra's financial 
difficulties.  At present, we are getting balanced press and I fear that any 
explanation/outreach to the most vitriolic opposition will be used against 
us.  I am available to discuss this at your convenience.

"
1233,"Dear Steve,

Thanks for stopping by last week's Emissions Strategy Meeting.  As you 
requested, I have attached the presentations from the meeting, as well as an 
agenda and participant list.  

The forum was well received by participants -- many found the policy updates 
and information exchange elements very useful.  Several commercial groups 
expressed interest in continuing to discuss and share information on NOx, SO2 
and carbon/greenhouse gas markets as they evolve.  

We also spent considerable time discussing U.S. ""multipollutant"" regulatory 
strategies, and received good commercial feedback on the proposals we have 
been circulating in Washington.  From our perspective, the meeting was a 
success from a strategic standpoint, giving our group the needed commercial 
feedback to proceed with advocacy strategies and deliver information that is 
most useful to their businesses.

Key Outcomes:

? Participants from commercial groups -- EES, EGMs, ENA, and Enron Europe -- 
expressed interest in competitive intelligence and policy updates on 
emissions issues.

? Commercial groups asked that Environmental Strategies, perhaps quarterly, 
bring a group together to be briefed on the policy landscape and 
environmental drivers for Enron markets.  (Not likely to be a large meeting, 
but a conference call) 

? Development of a list-serve or intranet site was suggested to facilitate 
communication among the participants.  We are already working on a intranet 
site for delivery of information/intelligence, but will work to add elements 
where commercial groups can share information about business ideas or 
possible deals.

Please see the attached participant list, agenda and presentations for more 
information.  Feel free to call me or Jeff if you have any questions.

1235,"Several recent developments, and in the interest of economy (mine!), I am 
copying all of you, who will have varying interests in this.

First, as soon as the upper house of parliament passes legislation, Austria 
will have accelerated their market oppening, to 100% in power by 2001, 
October, and by 2002, October for gas.  Sadia, you will want to reflect this 
in what you are doing for Kyran/EES, and Kathryn, you will want to note this, 
if Investor Relations is updating this data for analysts.  Margaret, FYI to 
you, too.

Second, I note that this decision was reached after being supported by a 
studyby the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), saying 
liberalisation would bring down prices by 12-15%.  Paul H., suggest you have 
Viviana get a copy, and if in English, send copies to Margaret Carson.

Belgian cabinet has approved draft regulation lowering power threshold to 
20GWh p.a.   This goes to 10 GWh on 31 December 2002.  Sadia, I think this is 
again an acceleration, to be reflected in your updated numbers.  Margaret and 
Kathryn, also note.

Finally, Kyran, I see that EnergieNed has issued a study saying that there is 
""not a direct relationship between efficiency and deregulation"".  I may take 
issue with this, depending upon what the full text says.  Can you work with 
Teun/Sadia to obtain a copy, and, if not too lengthy, get it translated for 
my review (and presumably your's, too)?  thanks

1247,"1. Alberta PPA - Transmission Cost Responsibility Hearing 

Enron is leading a coalition of 5 PPA Buyers that successfully advocated the AEUB to convene a process/hearing (the convening of which was opposed by the PPA Owners) to consider the proposal by the Transmission Administrator to apply transmission charges to PPA Buyers for transmission capacity that solely accrues to the financial benefit of PPA Owners.  One week of hearings were held in spring 2001 with the hearing scheduled to be completed in November 2001.  Value to Enron Canada if we prevail at hearing is approximately $Cdn 60 million.

2. Alberta PPA - Alberta Government Agreement to Split Enron's Sundance B PPA in Two PPAs

Government Affairs successfully lobbied Alberta Energy officials and Minister of Energy to agree to approve regulatory changes necessary to allow for the split of Enron's PPA into two PPAs despite one of the fundamental elements of the original PPA model was that the PPAs would be very large and not divisible.  This is important as the whole PPA represents 706 MW and is likely too large for Enron to sell as a whole but a PPA of 303 MW is much more marketable to potential Enron counter parties.  Value to Enron Canada if one-half PPA is sold is projected to be approximately $Cdn 50 million.

3. Alberta PPA - Opposition to Wabamun Water Treatment Plant Expansion 

Government Affairs in conjunction with legal group has achieved ""effected person"" status in relation to an application by TransAlta (Enron's PPA Owner counterparty) to undertake an expansion to the Wabamun Water Treatment Plant.  The objective is to position Enron to resist future attempts by TransAlta to pass through the cost of this expansion to Enron.  Value to Enron Canada if we succeed is project to be approximately $Cdn 2 million.

4. Alberta - Appointment to Key Government/Industry Committees

Enron Government Affairs staff are presently members of each of the key committees in Alberta responsible for providing advice to Government and/or its appointed agents (Power Pool, TA, AEUB) on electricity market design issues, including: Advisory Committee, Power Pool Operations Committee, AEUB Electric Reliability Task Force, Industry Structure Review Consultant Selection Committee, Retail Issues Committee, IPPSA Board of Directors.  Value to Enron not quantifiable.

5.  Alberta - Enron Direct

Enron Government Affairs provided extensive support to Enron Direct in undertaking media/government launch of Enron Direct in Alberta is presently assisting Enron Direct in determining rules and requirements to expand its service offerings to B.C. natural gas market and AltaGas Utilities service territory in Alberta.  Enron Government affairs is also advocating against discriminatory exit fees proposed by Atco Gas.  Value to Enron not quantifiable.

6. Ontario - Electricity Market Opening - continue to advocate Ontario electricity market opening.


7. Ontario - Enron Direct - support for the establishment of Enron Direct's business in Ontario, including the applicable rules, licensing, and development of business procedures and forms of contract to be used.

1274,"With regards to the existing deal, the setup costs and timeline was primarily the result of working out the kinks on legal/accounting structures to find a deal structure both sides could live with. I would hope costs would be lower on future additions. Having said that, though, the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity. To the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value upon a quick liquidation, the put/call price protection embeds more enron risk in the financing. In the current environment, I am less than confident I could sell the unsecured enron piece shortly. Jim, can you stay point on this exercise for the ercs and other items. Thanks.

Yesterday afternoon I spoke with Walt Madro, Sr. Vice President of Global Gas and LNG, regarding Marathon's decision not to pursue a marketing/trading relationship with Enron.  Walt further clarified Marathon's poisition :

Marathon is in final negotiations to acquire a firm with both Upstream assets and a small, niche marketing arm.
Steve Lowden told Walt to hold off on the negotiations with Enron because of the acquisition of this firm and the potential duplication of marketing compentencies. (??)
I asserted that this firm, even if acquired, does not have the premier gas and power franchise like Enron and Walt agreed.
As such, Walt will contact me when the deal is completed - expected date is before the end of the year.

I will stay in contact with Walt and try to identify the firm being acquired.  

Ultimately, I do not like how this ""smells.""  I would like to have a conversation with Lowden because the opportunity cost of not having a marketing/trading relationship with Enron versus acquiring this small firm (albeit receiving strategic Upstream assets), I can not compute intellectually.  Do you agree?

SUMMARY:  ENE held a conference call primarily to confirm that its business
units are on-track and to dispel some rumors in the marketplace.  ENE
reiterated its FY01 EPS guidance of $1.70-$1/75, which we consider to be
conservative (consensus is $1.74/sh, SCI-$1.80/sh).  ENE did not discuss
any change to 1Q01 EPS expectations (guidance $0.40-$0.45/sh, consensus
$0.45, SCI $0.43/sh).  Many of ENE's comments concerning the wholesale
energy trading confirm comments we are consistently getting from all the
energy convergence players.  The California situation is forcing utilities
across the country to deal with risk exposure to avoid a PG&E/Edison
situation.  Most utilities and other gas/electricity consumers are not
prepared to manage these risk and are now outsourcing energy management
activities to sophisticated marketing companies.  In addition, new
generation facilities are offering gas marketing opportunities.  ENE is
clearly the leader in energy marketing, trading & risk management.  There
are a few other sophisticated MT&RM companies (DYN, EPG, WMB, DUK, MIR,
Aquila), but there is a huge drop in sophistication below these top tier
marketers.  We believe the vast majority of the opportunity is being
captured by these few strong players.  ENE is expecting 1Q01 natural gas
volumes to be up 25% to 30% and electricity volumes to be up 25% to 50%
over 1Q00.

OPINION:  It is tough to get excited about buying a 30x multiple stock is a
market as ugly as the one we are currently experiencing.  However, ENE is
the leader in energy convergence and should be a part of any growth and/or
energy portfolio.  There are few opportunities to build a position in the
stock at reasonable valuations and we believe ENE's current valuation is
very attractive (31x FY01, 26x FY02).   Business fundamentals are quite
strong and ENE is benefiting from a market where tight energy markets
encourage customers to focus on large, well-established suppliers for their
energy requirements.

CLEARING UP THE NOISE:
   EBS LAYOFFS.  Rumors have circulated that ENE was laying off employees
   in its Broadband segment and even that it was disbanding its Broadband
   business.  We expect ENE to continue to build the Intermediation and
   Content Services units.  ENE expects to build its Network with a larger
   percentage of contracted capacity than previously expected and reduced
   its capital expenditure expectations from $750 million this year to $250
   million.  The reduced activity in building out the Network is
   contributing to reduced staffing requirements in the Network area.
   PGE DIVESTITURE.  CEO Jeff Skilling placed only a 5% probability on the
   completion of the $1.7 billion PGE sale to Sierra Pacific.  The PGE
   asset is likely to continue as part of the ENE portfolio in the
   near-term.  We had previously considered PGE to be a discontinued
   business.  PGE EPS contributions will be marginally positive to FY01 EPS
   expectations.
   INDIA GENERATION.  ENE's Dabhol, India power project (826 MW) is
   experiencing a similar crisis to the one in California.  The electricity
   purchaser of the power generated by Dabhol is backed by the Indian
   government, but has not been able to pass through the increased cost of
   power caused by higher oil prices.  ENE has been relying on the
   guarantee from the Indian government for payment for its electricity
   sales. ENE has continued to receive payment from he government but is
   subject to regulatory risks for this project.
   CALIFORNIA CREDIT EXPOSURE.  We believe ENE is managing its credit risk
   appropriately."

1282,"Hi Louise,
Please let me know if you have any questions!

 

      "
1283,"We consistently have to work on the lack of response issue.  Some of that is dealt with through walking around and poking around.  We just have to be vigilant in ferreting out information.  Additionally, approval can be received via e-mail, phone or in-person from business unit head OR commercial group head.  Our goal will be to do everything possible to make sure an article appears rather than holding it for future release.

As for the EEOS/ENA or cross group issue, that is addressed in #4 below.  Please advise.

1285,"Louise,

Just a heads up on an opportunity you might hear about:

- NEPCO has an EPC contract with a small IPP for a 245MW combined cycle project in Goldendale, WA, adjacent to an aluminum smelter

- NEPCO brought an EECC turbine to the project as part of the EPC contract

- The developer's financing fell through 3 weeks ago (they attempted a highly structured muni-bond financing with tolls for marketers and the smelter)

- NEPCO has been paid several million $ for engineering services, but construction wont start until a big payment ($30MM+) is made April 18

- When the financing fell through they called the big generators to see who would step up - Reliant was the most agressive, but last week Reliant changed their bid - instead of paying up-front they will pay at COD subject to high delay damages

- The developer appears to be in a bad box 

- NEPCO called us last week - the developer would like Enron to provide construction financing

- I sent in a SWAT team to check out the project

- In general, we like it, but I am not interested in lending $ to other people, so I am figuring out if we could just buy it.  It is approx $200MM to construct but its early time to market may make it economic

Three things could happen here:
1) Someone else buys it and NEPCO continues with their EPC contract

2) Enron buys the project from the developer, constructs and flips

3) Project dies altogether - in this case we want to make sure ENA gets the turbine - Janet and I wanted it last year; now Duran, Jacoby and I still want it.


I will keep you posted.

Regards,

Chris

1287,"Senate approves Edison rescue deal, Assembly measure stalled
By Jennifer Coleman 
Associated Press Writer 
SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state Senate approved a bill that significantly alters the plan negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis to help the struggling utility Southern California Edison. 
The bill approved Friday, authored by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco and Byron Sher, lets Edison issue $2.5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record-high levels in the last year. 
""I believe it's a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out of the business of buying electricity ... and to bring this entity to creditworthiness,"" said Polanco, D-Los Angeles. 
Approved 22-17, the bill now goes to the Assembly. The Assembly adjourned Friday night without voting on a similar measure. 
The Polanco-Sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by Edison, which says it won't help the company escape bankruptcy. 
Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its estimated $3.5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay skyrocketing wholesale power prices. 
Under the plan by Polanco, and Sher, of Stanford, the state has a five-year option to buy Edison's grid. 
That, said Republican Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, gives Edison a bailout it ""neither needs nor deserves. 
""I am tired of this projection of Edison as a victim. They have their legion of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn't support deregulation,"" Johnson said during floor debate. ""The idea of Edison as the victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers. Edison paid their lobbyists bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation."" 
During the 1995-1996 deliberations that led to deregulation, Edison officials helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican. 
Lawmakers are set to go on summer break Friday night until Aug. 20, a schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the Memorandum of Understanding between Davis and Edison. That says the Legislature must approve the deal by Aug. 15. 
""It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess,"" Davis said Friday. 
For that to happen, either the Senate bill or a proposal by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has to reach Davis. 
""I have problems with both bills,"" Davis said. ""I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house."" 
The Keeley-Hertzberg plan trims at least $300 million from the governor's offer. It also allows Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by Edison ratepayers over 10 years. 
The plan also attempts to increase the state's use of ""green"" energy resources and allow Edison customers to opt for cheaper direct-access energy service. 
The Assembly didn't vote on the Keeley bill Friday, because Hertzberg is considering forming a working group with the Senate and the administration to ""iron out the bills' differences,"" said Hertzberg's spokesman Paul Hefner. 
Davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer break to devise a compromise by the Aug. 15 deadline. 
""I don't want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry about it on Aug. 20 because I know we're going to have reapportionment and other major issues to deal with in that last month,"" the governor said.

will need at least one extra person.  it looks like everyone that was there 
last time is coming again and also kristi said she would be there, but that 
still leaves us short.  i hope the pool construction doesnt disrupt y'all too 
much.  the good thing is that my dad is overseeing it and he is being really 
hard on the guys, making sure they are as clean and quick as they can 
possibly be.  kim already said that jeffrey cant wait to come swimming.

I am not sure if I have already sent you this resume.
Please, take a  look at it. I met Claude a few years ago
and was greatly impressed by him. He may be a good candidate to
work with Andy Zipper.

1300,"The auction is now closed -- no more rounds will be run.  In round 70, there
were no new bids, no bid withdrawals, and no proactive waivers submitted.
In accordance with the auction rules, the Minister of Resource Development
will decide no later than Thursday, August 24 whether to accept all winning
bids or to reject all winning bids.  Names of standing high bidders will not
be revealed before the Minister's decision."

of October ICAP today.  Cost- $0.70 Kwm or $70,000.

   "
1302,"We will wear the ICAP position with the following marks that represent the 
true mid.

 2001 2.00 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2002 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2003 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)

These new marks result in $9 million of incremental value that will hit 
Dana's P&L tonight.   Based on our discussion earlier, East Power (Dana 
specifically) is now fully wearing this position and fully assumes all 
downside and upside associated with the position.

John -- Sorry we did not catch up when I was in Houston in December.  At the time, I was in the process of leaving the company I helped to start  and have joined a sports marketing agency to build their international business.
At some point, I would be interested in speaking with you about some projects (domestic and international) that we're working on.  One of our business groups specialize in the stadium/properties naming rights field and there are some great opportunities including the new Pittsburgh Steelers stadium.  I thought one of your companies or possibly New Power might have an interest in taking a look at it.  Let me know when you have a free moment.

1316,"Dear Mr. Lay:

On behalf of Assistant Secretary of Defense (C3I) and DoD CIO Arthur Money,
I would like to invite you to participate in the Secretary of Defense's
Highlands Forum. The Highlands Forum is a cross-disciplinary group of
eminent scholars, researchers, CEO's/CIO's/CTO's from industry, and leaders
from the media, the arts and the professions, who have met over the past six
years to examine areas of emerging interest to all of us.  The idea is to
gain a better understanding of the new environment we will all be living and
working in, and to examine the fundamental changes that will impact that
environment.  The Forum includes seniors from the White House, Defense, and
other agencies of government (we limit government participation to about
25%).  Our meetings over the past six years have covered such diverse topics
as ""The Mind, the Brain, and Computing""; ""The Convergence of Information
Technology and Biotechnology""; and ""Innovation in Public Sector
Organizations"".  Our meeting in May explored MEMS, nanotechnology, and
molecular computing; among our participants were: Sun Microsystems founder
Bill Joy, Phil Kuekes of HP, Nobel laureate Rick Smalley. Our last meeting
in September focused on the future of software, and participants included
Inktomi founder Eric Brewer, SUN CTO Greg Papadopoulos, Packet Design CEO
Judy Estrin (board member of FedEx and Cisco), and Esther Dyson.

The Forum is an idea engine--there are no reports and no consensus
recommendations. Meeting size is usually kept to around 30 people to remain
small and informal, encouraging maximum discussion of ideas presented by a
speaker or a panel; we call it strategic conversation.  While there is media
participation in our meetings, there is no press coverage of the
discussions.  Our distinguised media participants in this meeting (CEO, UPI;
Exec. Editor, International Herald Tribune) will take part representing
themselves and will  act as moderators.

Several of our participants strongly suggested that I contact you to tell
you about the Forum and this particular meeting. We are going to hold
Highlands Forum 16 in Washington, DC, on December 14-15 (half day on the
15th).  The topic will be built around the search for
information/transformation strategies for the Department of Defense (and
government in general). The Assistant Secretary would like to hold this
Highlands to think about the elements of an information strategy, and I have
suggested that we look at information and strategy from a business
perspective (transformation, productivity, competitive advantage).  We will
look at  4 or 5 useful business cases for context.  ENRON is a remarkable
example of transformation in a highly rigid, regulated industry, that has
created a new model and new markets.

The Defense Department is not only creating an operational strategy which
has information superiority (better, faster decision making) at its core;
the Department also has an enormous global business enterprise which can
benefit from many of the best practices and ideas from industry enabling it
to achieve greater efficiencies and be a better steward of public funds.
Clearly, not all the elements translate well from the business envrionment,
however, many do.  I am interested in business cases which ideally describe
an enterprise-level information or transformation strategy--those which see
an information strategy as the overarching strategy, or at least as a core
component of corporate/operational strategy--use of information technology,
information protection/assurance, CRM, and perhaps how to use information
and technology to transition or capture or create a new market. One
operational example that we will look at is Cemex, the Mexican cement
company that uses I.T. (GPS and communications) to ""swarm"" its trucks in the
ready cement business. Their COO will be joining us to describe how they
succeeded in dominating their market. In addition to Cemex, other companies
represented in our agenda include Cisco, eBay, Schwab, and Sourceree.

ENRON is of great interest to us.  What we learn from you may help the
Department of Defense a great deal as it works to build a new strategy. I
hope that you have time on your busy schedule to join us for as much of the
Highlands Forum as you can attend and speak with the group. I would be happy
to tell you more about the Forum.  In the meantime, please take a look at
the Secretary's Website for the Forum to get a better idea of what it is and
what is has accomplished: www.hlforum.com; username: cc27 (lowercase);
password: SVN8 (Uppercase). I am also attaching a short document which gives
a bit more information about the Forum.

1328,"Just a heads up from a Business Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) meeting we had 
on Monday to try to raise the proposed $1.6 million for 2001 activities.  
(You will hear all about the business plan today.)

The suggested amount for you/Enron is $200,000--12.5% of the total.  Enron 
gave $50,000 for the 2000 effort, which was about 8% of the total they ended 
up raising ($617,000).   it is your call on what is reasonable, and keep in 
mind there might be another round later on.

We have been working on a list of potential donors with ""A"" being the 
impacted such as refiners and petrochemical companies and ""B"" being 
beneficiaries such as contractors.  Ned Holmes office suggested that you pick 
the names of the potential donors for the Enron visit and he will just take

Ken and I just cut short our Italy trip with friends to return to Houston
for the birth of our 6th grandchild (which is the final one for this round
of four pregnancies).  We were happy to return home and I am a very thankful
and thrilled grandmother (aka Momie, Mamamia, Mamia, Mia).  This was the
first live birth that I have personally witnessed since my last baby, Beau,
and it was VERY exhilarating and VERY emotional, as evidenced by the
attached photos.  I hope you will enjoy seeing my new grandson ""Pate David
Herrold"" (Pate was Courtney's maiden name) who was born on June 8, 2000 at
7:19 p.m.  Pate was 7 lbs, 10 ozs, 20 inches long with a lot of dark curly
hair.  I think he looks exactly like David at birth, but time will tell.
These photos were taken in the delivery room within the first 15-20 minutes
of his birth prior to being cleaned up and returned to the nursery.  He
looks pretty darn good for just having arrived into this world with such
great force.  So far, he is a VERY calm and good infant just like his Daddy
was.  Enjoy!  Big kiss and lots of love, LPL

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200."
1349,"Jeff McMahon has proposed that Ben Glisan is the most appropriate person to provide brief summaries to the BoD on Chewco, Whitewing and Marlin, if Ken would like these topics presented to the BoD.  Both Jeff and Ben will be standing by for today's meeting in case they are needed.  Joe Dilg will attend the full meeting, most likely via teleconference.  

Following is a revised note to Ken.  Thanks.

1351,"Rosie...absolutely!!  I'll make my schedule work.  However, unless this is a personal favor Ken is doing for the gentlemen involved, I'd also be happy to ""field"" this for him.  I told Ken we(University Affairs/Public Affairs) would not impose on his schedule for these kinds of visits until after January.  Clearly, there are occasions where some of Ken's many friends contact him directly, and , as kind as Ken is, even at extreme times, he agrees.   However, if this is not a personal visit, I'm quite certain this dean is looking for a better financial and recruiting relationship with Enron.  In fact, we are putting together a ""master Plan"""" financial relationship with UT overall (Rick Causey is the exec lead), and realistically, we are not recruiting engineers per se.  So Rosie my darling friend, let me know if you'd like me to politely intervene and take this off your list, or if this  is one of those personal friendship situations, in which case, I'll be there on the 14th!
 
Thanks and kisses!!

1352,"Dear Ken -

Please don't be heartbroken about the value of anyone's portfolio or stand in line to beat yourself up about it (again).  
  
Contrary to popular opinion, there is nothing that Enron executives or Wall Street analysts can do to ruin anyone's future.  The ""portfolio problem"" is not loss of value, rather lack of values--people need to get some personal values that are worth a damn!  

I know our current scenario wasn't a part of your vision for Enron, but stockholder anxiety just shows that most people are spiritual morons.  God promises to take care of each and every one of us under absolutely every circumstance.  People choose to ignore this; in doing so, they reject His blessings in favor of their own worries.  So be it. 

You are not responsible for how we (stockholders) choose to react/respond to life's exigencies.  Certainly we might wish you had ""chosen vanilla,"" but no financial loss is appropriate cause for anyone to feel devastated and come whining to you.  So we're down a few $ billion - this is so piddling!  God has ""umpty-zillion"" in money + much more important stuff to make up this perceived loss.   

I sincerely hope you can find some comfort in these thoughts.  

Betty

P.S.
I am very grateful for your staying with us; I know the going is extremely tough for you these days."
1353,"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

1358,"Mr. Lay:

First, I want to say that I've been a dedicated employee of Enron for 9 yea=
rs now and, looking back over that time, it's been the greatest period of m=
y life, career-wise.  When I first went to work for Enron, I was almost sta=
rry eyed.  I was working for the home town team and it was just the greates=
t company I had ever been associated with.  I started out with Enron Power =
Corp. and the energy and focus within that group was just incredible.

I've seen a lot of change over the past 9 years.  Some great, some good and=
 some not so good.  But all in all, I would do it all over again in a heart=
 beat, because I still trust in the core of this company and decisions our =
management have made.  But most of all, we've still got great people.  Base=
d on the current events of the past 3 to 6 months, it does indeed look like=
 we are going to have to ""do it all over again"".  However, I am an eternal =
optimist.  Looking at this in football terms...  this is a rebuilding year =
and we've got a bright future with a young team and a deep bench.

One thing I always hung my hat on was the integrity that both you and Rich =
Kinder exuded.  I was saddened to see Mr. Kinder move on, but I was confide=
nt that having you remain behind would continue our successes.  And we have=
 been successful.  Aside from the LJM issue (which, to be honest, I still d=
on't fully understand), I think we've just had some external distractions t=
hat have hampered our stock growth this year, such as Dabhol, Portland Gene=
ral, California, etc., in addition to the market conditions in general. =20

In the all-employee meeting, you told the troops that it was going to take =
the continued dedication and hard work from all of us to get things going i=
n the right direction in order for us to dig out from this mess.  I am full=
y prepared to do this, however, there is one request I would like to bring =
up.  I know I am not the only person out there who has options that are goi=
ng to expire at the end of this year.  In all my wildest dreams (or nightma=
res), I would have never envisioned the stock getting low enough to threate=
n a grant price of $21.563, but here we are.  As a dedicated and confident =
employee, I hung in there early in the year and listened to all indications=
 around me that the stock would go to 100.  Later in the year, as the stock=
 moved downward, I heard indications that we were going to bounce back stro=
ng.  I was on board.  I was excited.  I trusted that this was the case.  In=
 fact, I look back on this past year and, based on what I knew at the time,=
 I would probably do the same thing over again.

But...   that was then and this is now.  It has been painful for me, as I k=
now it has been for you and all others with a stake in this company.  I wan=
t to get us back to our heyday and am willing to commit to that end. =20

My request is simple...    is there any way possible to extend options expi=
ring at the end of this year by one year?

If you want to make a good faith gesture towards long-time employees who ar=
e willing to re-dedicate themselves to the daunting task at hand, I can thi=
nk of nothing better for the short term.   I think extending the expiration=
 date on options would go a long way towards healing an Enron employee popu=
lation who need some good news in the midst of this situation we find ourse=
lves in. =20

If you can't do anything, I will understand.  I know your office has always=
 had an open door policy with respect to e-mail feedback, but this is the f=
irst one I've ever written.  I always contend that it never hurts to ask in=
 a situation like this.

Dear Dr. Lay:

I am writing this message to you after a few days on the ground in
India. The news from India continues to be grim and I have several
things that I want to discuss with you.

1. The news on the oil and gas front is not good as u probably have
heard by now. There is little chance that BG will get its request for
operatorship approved for various reasons that I can explain. If u like,
we can do the deal on similar terms with another party and close the
same very quickly. I have been contacted by a few people and could
deliver the same to you if there is an interest.

2. On the Dabhol front, I would like to urge that we meet and discuss a
few ideas that I have. I know that you are extremely busy at this time
but maybe next week I could come to Houston and we could find some time
to meet. I know that there might be a difficulty in non-Enron especially
ex-Enron people working this issue when u have a full internal team
already on the job... but I think that it maybe useful and apprpriate to
put those concerns aside and see if a solution could be found using any
and all available resources. There maybe ways that would prevent the
equity from taking a big write off at this time and get everyone moving
towards finding a solution.

In the meantime, there is a strong effort in India along the judicial
enquiry front to use it to derail the arbitration. Our friends there can
help us only if we are on the ground and give them some hope that a
solution is going to be found. The Indian government is not terribly
motivated at this time and if Enron does not creat options, it will not
result in a terribly good result for Enron either financially or from a
PR perspective.

Again, I know that with several issues occupying you at this time, this
may not be the most burning one. However we have had limited success at
a resolution so far and some other alternatives maybe worth considering.
If you permit, I would love to discuss them with you.

1362,"Mr. Lay-

It was galling of you to blame employee rumors for Enron's falling share
price, as you did in your last eSpeak.

Most of us ""employees"" have never met an analyst. Most of us have not
left Enron, and continue to work hard here, unlike the large number of
Senior Management who have bailed ship. Most of us continue to buy Enron
stock, unlike Senior Management who remain brutal sellers of the stock.
And, most of us are compelled to be profitable on an almost daily basis
in our tasks, unlike Senior Management and its pet projects.

We are entitled to contrition from you, not spin. You made $140 million
last year as CEO of Enron, and none of us complained. We simply followed
you and your self-annointed protege' Jeff.

We didn't cause these recent events, Mr. Lay, in any way. You and Jeff
are almost solely responsible for the drop in Enron's share price. So
far, it's tragic for Enron that you choose to spin. Contrition would
have been accepted by most of us without question. And it probably still
would be.

Why don't you send out another email and accept personal responsibility
for the share price decline? As Joe Sutton would say, ""step up and be a
leader.""

for unquestioned loyalty to Enron. When I make a promise to my superiors
I deliver, even if that means working nights, weekends, or from home.

1363,"Dad,
I met with Peter Veruki at the Jones School of
Administration at Rice last week and we had a great
meeting. Our timing is a little off (they want someone
next spring and I want a position by Jan), but we are
still talking.
There is also a position open for Director of
Development of Rice University and I have contacted
Malcolm Gillis and Christie Patrick happens to be
meeting with him today so she is going to mention that
I am interested.
There are also a couple of positions at UH which I am
going to look into, so I am hopeful something good
will come of all this. Christie Patrick has been my
one woman promoter, she is wonderful.
I'll keep you posted.
I love you Dad,
Elizabeth

Dear Mr. Lay,

For what it is worth, I believe this move, although very unfortunate given Andy's long service to Enron, is the right thing to do. In the way that Enron has historically been the poster child for corporate innovation, I hope you will now lead us in the direction that makes us the poster child for handling a crisis of investor confidence. Enron is such an amazing company, I trust you will do everything necessary to work cooperatively with the investor community to restore the company to its former greatness.

Respectfully yours,

Many of my team appreciated your voice mail today.  I think they appreciated your candor about Andy, and more importantly, they appreciated your tone.  I think it would be helpful if you left frequent (weekly, or so) general updates to the degree you can.

Mike and I had a very successful floor meeting today, and so many of our employees came up to us after to mention their appreciation of our having such a meeting.

Your voice mails are great, and we need to use you more often.  I'd love (and I'm sure I speak for Mike on this) for you to attend one of our weekly staff meetings in the near future.

Of course, if there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.

During this trying time, please do not become so weary that you forget where and who your source and strength come from.  The Lord is there to give you comfort, peace, love, and strength.  You are His child. Seek His face and let your dependency be on Him.  He will not fail you.  He never does.

I am a Sr. Buyer for ETS.  I've been with the Company for over 19 years and I just want to tell you that as a long-time employee, I have nothing but the highest admiration and respect for you and the way you tackle the challenges of running this vast corporation.  Sure my financial investment in this company has suffered along with everyone else's but I'm not worried.  Enron is a solid company and you are most capable.

	Thank you for your presentation yesterday.  As always, you handled very well some tough questions in a very trying time for Enron.  I was literally mortified when I heard the ""crack"" question-- but I think you handled that well too.  As a 17-year Enron veteran, the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  I'm sure you must know that the majority of Enron's employees don't feel the same way as this one individual.  

Thanks for your continued hard work and support.

I only heard part of the employee meeting as I had to leave for the airport to return to Puerto Rico but wanted to say that I have all the confidence in the world that under your leadership Enron will return to the great company it is.  

We have all been through tough times (I use to be a land drilling contractor from 1979 to 1988). This company is sound, with good people who with the right leadership & direction can achieve the goal of  being the best company in the world.  

I have been working with Enron as a contractor since March 99 in Panama, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas (LNG project).  I report to Mariella Mahan and  Greg Curran.   I really enjoy working with Enron and can assure you that you and Enron will always have my loyalty & confidence.  

I am proud to say I work with Enron and want to do my part to bring this company back.

*Vanilla has always been my favorite flavor!"
1377,"Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Yes, Brenda and I are already planning our next group trip ( however, we have
only been able to obtain 7 confirmations but not to worry, Macey is included
and I will make videos for you if we are unable to confirm space for you too.)

As to ""no other fool would walk with you in the morning,"" have you considered
a deaf person might enjoy walks with you.

And, Brenda and I go as a ""package"" so when you think of Brenda you cannot
help but include me....sorry.

Finally, as to the spelling your name in the letter, my secretary made the
mistake when she retyped what Brenda and I wrote and faxed and E-mailed it to
all.  We would never miss the spelling of your name because we have always
thought it was a dichotomy that your last name included ""reason.""

Your Father wrote:

""Elizabeth -

The Republican Convention is July 31 - August 3.  Although there are no 
guarantees I expect I can get you tickets and reservations.

Liz, I have sent an e-mail to our Washington office to ask for assistance in 
obtaining hotel reservations and credentials.  We don't yet have reservations 
for Ken as everything is locked up by the Republicans, but I have been 
assured they will be forthcoming.  We asked for the same hotel as your Dad 
will have, so hopefully that will work.

My champion, hero, angel - I think I have made a major mistake!!!  I thought 
I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti

thinking I know anything about baseball.

Look forward to hearing from you!!

1389,"Hi Terry -

Ken Lay said that he would really like an update and more detail about the

Thanks.

1393,"Dear Mr. Misaki:

Dr. Lay would prefer that the pre-meeting continue to be scheduled at 8:30 
a.m. on January 29, as he has conflicts the afternoon of January 28, so it 
would be difficult for him to attend.

Please advise.

1394,"Dear Mr. Krishna -

If it is convenient for you, Dr. Lay is suggesting that you meet on Friday, 
January 28 at 3:45 p.m. at the Hotel Meierhof.  Dr. Lay will meet you in the 
lobby and you can meet at a table in the restaurant at the hotel.

Please advise if this works with your schedule.

1401,"Oh, Gabriella (that is such a pretty name!) -

I apologize for not responding.  The conference details have been a bit 
confusing to us as we didn't seem to have many.  Mr. Lay is scheduled to 
participate in a Ministerial Working Dinner the evening of May 15.  He has to 
give a brief report on his forum session from earlier in the afternoon.  It 
is being held at the Kleber International Conference Centre.  Therefore, Dr.

Wall Street City=01,s Stock Search of the Week

1.  Searching for January Effect Hopefuls

The ""January Effect"" is an oft-discussed phenomenon that
occurs when stocks that have sold off near the end of one
calendar year outperform the broader markets at the
beginning of the following year.   Typically, these stocks
decline late in the calendar year due to tax selling, but
are repurchased after the wash sale period expires.
Candidates for an early calendar year rebound are often those
stocks with favorable fundamental characteristics.

January Effect Hopefuls is a search strategy that screens
for such candidates.  Primary criteria include a negative
26-week return and a market capitalization of between
$50 - $750 million.  The January Effect tends to occur more
often with small to mid-cap stocks than it does with
large-cap stocks.  Utilizing the current ratio and
debt-to-equity criteria in the restrictive mode screens for
balance sheet strength.  Companies with high current ratios
and low debt-to-equity ratios have lower levels of financial
risk.  The two revenue percentage change criteria screen for
companies with acceleration in their quarterly revenue growth
rates.  Positive forecast earnings growth is then sought to
improve the chances that the companies will continue their
growth trends in the future.  As a final criterion, positive
earnings surprises are sought for the past four reported
quarters; companies that have a history of exceeding analysts'
expectations tend to outperform their peers.

Though the search strategy is designed with the January
Effect in mind, it works well throughout the year for
investors who follow contrarian strategies.  Investors who
are eyeing the results with the January Effect in mind should
note that back testing showed material divergences in
individual stock returns, therefore, selecting a basket of
securities instead of one or two stocks may reduce risk.

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved 
posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas 
Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink 
project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to 
markets in New Jersey and New York.

Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco 
to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 
Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state 
of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind 
and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire 
MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file 
executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four 
months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate 
eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered 
by the original certificate.

The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on 
non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project 
and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The 
$80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 
would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the 
Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a 
portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines 
currently are running full.

1456,"El Paso Merchant Ordered to Relinquish Data

FERC yesterday ordered El Paso Merchant Energy to stop stonewalling and turn 
over protected materials to parties involved in a complaint case in which 
it's alleged the affiliate received preferential treatment when it acquired 
1.2 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. 

Specifically, the Commission denied El Paso Merchant's request for rehearing 
of a June 2000 order that granted in part the discovery sought by the 
California Public Utilities Commission, and rejected rehearing of a September 
protective order. The latter directed El Paso Merchant to make available to 
all intervening parties, who agreed to the terms of the protective order, all 
of the materials that were being submitted to the CPUC and FERC in the case. 

So far, El Paso Merchant has refused to release the information to these 
parties, claiming the materials being filed with the CPUC and FERC are for 
""Government Eyes Only."" It also argues that the protective order offers 
inadequate protection of commercially sensitive information. 

The Commission disagreed. ""El Paso Merchant has not substantiated or 
sufficiently justified its broad claim that all of the 'protected materials' 
provided to CPUC and this Commission warrant the designation 'Government Eyes 
Only.' Indeed, all of the information that El Paso Merchant seeks to 
shield...relates directly to the issues,"" the order said [RP00-241]. Also, 
FERC finds that the protective order provides ""sufficient protection for El 
Paso Merchant's commercially sensitive documents."" 

The CPUC brought the complaint last April. It is seeking to abrogate the $38 
million contract arrangement between El Paso and El Paso Merchant. The agency 
alleges the affiliate was given ""preferential treatment"" by El Paso during 
the open season for the capacity, and thus the contract arrangement should be 
declared void. 

The CPUC and others contend the contract arrangement, which awarded more than 
one-third of El Paso's capacity rights to the California border to El Paso 
Merchant, is largely responsible for the high natural gas and electric prices 
in the state. They have urged FERC to ""act immediately"" on the merits of the 
complaint, but the Commission has yet to do so.

Next week, we are going to begin Phase I of the Windows 2000/Outlook 
Project.  In this phase, we will be gathering information about the hardware 
and software that you are using within your group.  

The process will begin with an email inventory.  You will receive an email on 
Monday, September 25, with the subject of W2K Inventory-Please Open.  All you 
need to do is open the email message.  This email will do a quick inventory 
of applications you have installed on your PC or that you may access from the 
network, as well as your desktop hardware specifications.  The information 
gathered from this email will be stored in a Notes database for reporting.  
It is very important that you open this email from your primary workstation.  
Please do not open it remotely, or if you're checking someone else's mail.

Mid-week, we will deploy teams to conduct individual interviews to assure 
that we have a complete picture of your technical environment.  This process 
will take approximately six weeks to complete for all of ETS.  The findings 
from these interviews will determine the Phase II start date.

Data Responsibility

As we prepare for this massive effort, we ask that you assist us by doing the 
following:
1) identify any business-related applications that may reside locally.
2) remove data from the local drive of your desktop (c:\ and/or d:\), and 
store it on your network drive.  The special data requirements of laptop  
users will be addressed during the actual migration.
3) remove all non-business-related data from network drives.
4) remove non-company-owned applications from your environment.
5) if you have historical data that does not change, contact the Solution 
Center and have a CD created for a more permanent storage method.


Training for Windows 2000/Outlook

Training requirements will be addressed during Phase II by a number of 
methods that will include:
hands-on training, which will consist of 1 hour on Windows 2000 and 2 hours 
on Outlook,
IPTV video,
tri-fold cards on the Microsoft products, and
CBT (Computer-Based Training).

1468,"Shelley,
I'm glad we made the decision to participate in today's drafting session.  
There were only nine of us involved, with Ed Ross, Skip Simmons and Craig 
Chancellor representing the generators, while Byron White, Georgia Carter and 
myself were there to represent the pipelines.  The others were with the 
Alliance.  Ed was his usual self.  He was confidently making the good 
economic case why the pipelines should consider the generator's position and 
how/why the FERC would likely side with them.  Craig tried to frame it 
commercially, and Skip played peacemaker.  Byron and I played a little ""good 
cop/bad cop"" on behalf of the pipes, with Byron being the bad cop.  

Anyway, sum and substance, I think we'll be more pleased with the next draft 
of this document than what was submitted to us recently.   The first sentence 
was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of the 
parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to 
physical operating considerations.  There emerged a realization that maybe 
two products are being contemplated here:  (1) a product that blocks out a 
period of time for uniform deliveries (say, 8 hours), and (2) a product that 
basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed upon 
block of capacity.  It was agreed that the first product is likely to be less 
valuable than the second, and priced accordingly.  Byron and I argued that 
segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated, and in fact, may be 
physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline.  The generators 
originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the NURF rights 
were carved up by hour, (ex. an 8 hr. block of 5,000/d could be repackaged as 
two 8 hr. blocks of 2,500/d).  I'm not sure whether we got consensus there or 
not -- we'll have to see the next draft.

The big ticket items (nos. 8, 9) got the most press.  I was troubled by the 
generators' interpretation of both.  In the case of no. 8, the generators 
wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a 
firm service (whether FT, NNS or storage) could, pursuant to the conversion 
formula, remarket their original firm service as NURF.  The generators were 
looking at this provision as ""throwing a bone"" to existing customers who 
might want to compete with the pipeline for NURF service using capacity (ex. 
seasonal) that may not be fully utilized.  Obviously, the predetermined 
conversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines, as well as the whole 
notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole (ie. two or more 
different product types).  We pointed out the services were all different, 
and in fact, any combination of those services, conceivably, could be 
repackaged under today's rules and sold as a proxy for NURF.  I believe we 
were successful in taming that language down substantially.  However, be on 
the lookout for the next draft.

Finally, with respect to no. 9, where the generators want receipts considered 
rateable with deliveries for purposes of NURF, the generators had an 
intersting slant.  Essentially, Ed was saying that he didn't want the 
pipelines to hold the generators hostage on rates for NURF if the pipelines 
were the only ones who could offer NURF.  By requiring the pipelines to 
consider rateable receipts as meeting the NURF criteria, then Ed said the 
generators would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for 
""NURF-like"" service.  Skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at 
Westar in West Texas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to 
a power plant located at the California border was probably unworkable.  
However, he also posed the hypothet that if SoCalGas were to provide the same 
storage service at the California border and those deliveries into SoCalGas 
could be adjusted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant (a 
sort of diversion of gas theory), then the pipeline should be operationally 
indifferent to whether it was providing NURF service or a 3rd party was 
providing a NURF-like service.  They just want others to have the ability to 
compete with the pipeline.

Of course, the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be 
the same.  Moreover, accepting such a nomination from SoCalGas could 
conceivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on 
(IT, LFT, etc.) as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the 
pipeline's NURF service.  Skip scratched out a more tame version of no. 9, 
and Ed agreed to consider it.  Be on the lookout for what they come up with.

Overall, as I said, I'm glad I was there, as well as the other pipeline 
representatives.  I hope that we were successful in getting the generators 
back on track here.  I'll be interested in seeing how much of our discussion 
today is embodied in the next generator draft.

I told the group they were in trouble on Thursday, as we were sending in the 
""A"" team.  Good luck and call if you have any questions.

1474,"There must be something I have missed. The work order was submitted to Marketing for approvals and is in SAP but has not been released to date. The middle of February in-service date mentioned below is out of the question. I have not received word that pogo has given the go ahead for design or materials. We are doing the design (e-mail of 1-8-01) in preparation that they will want the interconnect. 
Please bring me up to date if there have been changes since the first week of January and if the scope of the project has changes since the cost estimate and materials requirements were submitted in early January.

Transwestern's average deliveries to California were 840 MMBtu/d (77%), with San Juan lateral throughput at 829 MMBtu/d.  Total East deliveries averaged 491 MMBtu/d.  

El Paso's average deliveries to California were 1568 MMBtu/d (54%):
- PG&ETop, capacity of 1140 MMBtu/d, deliveries of 426 MMBtu/d (37%)
- SoCalEhr, capacity 1250 MMBtu/d, deliveries of 713 MMBtu/d (57%)
- SoCalTop, capacity 540 MMBtu/d, deliveries of 429 MMBtu/d (79%)

Friday's posted Gas Daily prices:
	SoCal gas, large pkgs	  2.35 (-.535)
	PG&E, large pkgs	  2.29 (-.55)

1477,"Christine, pls draft the IOS language for posting the 14,000/day capacity to 
Topock for the period April thru Oct 2001.  I would like the IOS on our Web 
page for Friday 8/4.  The IOS should include  Alt delivery rights to Needles 
and Citizens/Griffith when that point becomes active late next summer (when 
the power plant comes on line).  TW reserves the right to reject all bids (I 
think with the exception of max rate bids).  Please check with the Team and 
Susan Scott with any questions.

Bids will be taken between 10:00am - 2pm CST on Thurs. 8/10.

Please see Lorraine on any questions when drafting the posting or procedures 
(all documents are on the shared drive).

We will need to call shippers and possibly draft a message to be posted in 
Gas Daily for Monday 8/7.

1482,"I agree with Teb.
The ""book-out"" is GTC Section 14.A.

Not sure what you mean by ""Balancing Entities"".
The same DPOA covers both contracts.
But, there are two contracts.
And, the two contracts are accounted for separately.
Each contract must be ""balanced"".
(Whether covered by one DPOA or two DPOAs.)
Is that what you mean?

Since FPU holds two FTS-1 contracts (according to Nancy), 
we could probably combine them (if FPU wants top do that).
Jim says that we did that for Peoples.
We would have to check and see if there was any reason not to combine.
If they were combined, then there would be balancing under one contract.

White male 6 ft  165 lbs. light brown hair, not a bad looking person.
He came into my building while i was inside working and gave me the story

get inside.
i raised a shovel and informed him that he was trespassing.
this was Sunday. i just saw him again at 1pm walking north on Taft.

 for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's W=
eek 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - The Snake Pit Updated 11/2=
6/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched=
 at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mi=
tchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the B=
engals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  Keenan McCardell=
 , WR JAC - One Man Show Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 8=
0 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in=
 recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opp=
onents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Thrill Kil=
l Cult Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught fiv=
e passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack rem=
ains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL -=
 North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01  The Jaguars held Ismail to three =
catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail rem=
ains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most comple=
te and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Not So N=
ice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Ja=
cksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erra=
tic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - =
Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the bal! l ! six times f=
or 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during th=
e remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Executioners Updated=
 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught =
five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners =
would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian To=
mlinson , RB SD - The Executioners Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out =
of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The roo=
kie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego=
's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/25/01 Fl=
utie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Ar=
izona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advanta=
ge.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I did it again Updated 11/25/01 Plummer=

uarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/2=
5/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards=
 and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy r=
eceivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie J=

g against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. =
He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth startin=
g in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 11/25/01 Ho=
rn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New =
England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth =
starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - One Man Show Update=
d 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball ! fi=
! ve times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage=
 packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy=
 team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able=
 to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - T=
he Guzzlers Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two t=
ouchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a prett=
y good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - The Execu=
tioners Updated 11/25/01  Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, po=
sting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable =
Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Pa=
triots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Executioners Up=
dated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions a=
gainst the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look=
 like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - N=
orth Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 11/25/01 Sanders! l! eft Sunday's game agains=
t San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by Mar=
Tay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Who's =
Yo Daddy Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, ca=
tching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a f=
umble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disa=
ppointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best =
outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309=
 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fant=
asy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oron=
de Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eigh=
t passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and =
lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in=
 these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Meximullets Updated 1=
1/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yar! ds! , three TDs and no interceptions at =
Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fie=
dler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNa=

 Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performanc=
e.  James Thrash , WR PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught=
 four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be =
a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner ,=
 WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes f=

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

This is  a new day and time for this meeting.  Thank you and I apologize for any inconvenience.

Background:  A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would have implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms.

Often times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the trade date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins to question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9/01/01 to 9/30/01.

Request Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not just for a different month?

Thank you in advance.

1583,"Hey guys,
 
I just wanted to give you a friendly reminder to please have someone go through all your books to look for any deals with ECC and a third counterparty for October and November 2001 production.  I'll try to find as many as I can, but I'm not as familiar with all of your books as you are, and I don't want any deals to be missed.  If you come across any deals can you please flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible as there are only a couple more days left this month, and settlements needs to get started on invoicing.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions on this.
 
Thanks

Phillip, I apologize for the delay, let me know what you if anything else besides the Financial/Physical tag is needed and I'll get on it immediately.

Also, there are no current products under Jason Wolfe, Matt Smith or Jane Tholt.  Please let me know if we need to create products for them or if we will be moving existing ones to them.

for you !!!!!! Compliments of Korbel. When you come to Marlowe's New Year's
Eve after work between 4:00 and 6:00 and bring two friends, you will receive
a complimentary half bottle of the bubbly. If you bring in 4 friends you
will  recieve a full bottle .Be sure to invite everyone. The more the
merrier.

Take a look at my profile and send me an e-mail if you'd like.  Hope to hear from you!

The following is my profile text:

I never thought I'd be using a ""dating service"". But I'm open to trying new things - so let's give it a try. I'm an outgoing, positive, fun person. I LOVE to travela nd experince new places and cultures. I'm always learning something new - right now it's the guitar. I'm also really happy being alone with myself to read, write, or just putz around. I love kids, and they love me - probably because I'm pretty much a kid at heart still. I'm very close to my family and have probably too many good friends - I spend a lot of time keeping up with them all.

1637,"Hi Paul-- 

Thanks very much for your email!  I would have to say that I'm not an extremist in any sense of the word, so you're pretty safe there... My only potential concern is that I've been described (not infrequently) as being sarcastic and I'm afraid it's a trait that won't change all that easily. If it's not going to be a deal-breaker for you, I'd love to chat. 

Thanks and happy Wednesday!

1639,"Paul,

Thank you for taking the time to write.  Sorry I haven't gotten back to this sooner or the few other messages you sent.  I read your profile and you really seem like a great person.  My concern is that I have a cat... that I adore.  Her name is Missy and she was my Mom's. I have been taking care of her since my mom was in a fatal car accident two years ago and love this cat to pieces.   Sorry... I don't know if you are allergic or like some folks who just simply  don' t like cats... but she is part of my world and rock's it.  

If you don't mind my saying so... you should get a close up of your eyes... they are ""beautiful!""  I know my picture is kinda blurry and I have no room to talk about picture quality... but you need to get up close up of those babies, ""WOW!""  I don't mean to sound too flirtatious,  I just wanted to extend you a compliment where it is due.  What is the background behind you in the picture????

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.  ""Be Safe!""

Are all the good men REALLY already taken? 
I sometimes think I'm a walking contradiction: I'm feminine but like
being ""one of the guys"", cynical but trusting, opinionated but
accepting, set in my ways but adaptable, shy but outgoing. I've been
told I'm very ""real"" -- what you see is what you get.

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the ""Scan Risk"" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 3 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, January 10, 2002.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN (1 * $2,500)
=              $2,500
One Short Tier 3 NG or NN     (1 * $2,000)
=         -    $2,000
Net Scan Risk       ($2,500-$2,000)
=              $   500
Spread Rate         (1* $500)
=         +    $   500
Total Requirement
=              $1,000

1720,"Following are the proposed conditions to special use which we will be
submitting to the County for their review and attachment to the final zoning
approvals.  Please review and discuss any comments with me or Mark Gershon.


PROPOSED CONDITIONS TO SPECIAL USE
FOR
LIVINGSTON ENERGY CENTER (the ""Facility"")
TITAN LAND DEVELOPMENT CO., L.L.C. (""Titan"")
SOUTHEAST INTERSECTION OF 1400 N. AND 1700 E. ROADS (the ""Property"")


1. The operation of the Facility shall satisfy all Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency noise pollution requirements.

2. Titan shall enter into a roadway agreement with the County and
Township Highway Commissioners which assigns responsibility for repair of,
maintenance of, and debris removal on Township and County roadways during
construction of the Facility.

3. Contingent upon all property owners' written approval being secured,
Titan shall have installed at most four monitoring wells on at most four
properties within one and one-half miles surrounding the Property.  One
monitoring well each shall be installed on a property to the north, south,
east, and west.  Titan shall monitor well levels on each of the properties
on a quarterly basis and shall make such monitoring information available to
the County Engineer at his request for five years following issuance of the
final Certificate of Occupancy.  If no adverse impact due to the operation
of the Facility is found during the first five year monitoring period, then
Titan shall monitor well levels for each of the properties two (2) times per
year and shall make such monitoring information available to the County
Engineer upon his request for the life of the Facility.

4. The maximum number of power generating units shall be limited to a
maximum of ten (10).

5. Titan shall have repaired or replaced any drainage tile broken on
the Property during construction and operation of the Facility that would
adversely impact any surrounding property owner.

6. The site plan for the Facility shall allow no greater than forty
percent (40%) of the site's total acreage to be developed with
non-landscaped areas, open space, or agricultural uses

7. Upon permanent cessation of use of the Facility as an electric
generation facility, Titan shall remove all above ground buildings,
equipment, footings, appurtenances and structures, including accessory
buildings and equipment.

8. Titan shall make those stormwater improvements identified on the
attached Stormwater Management Plan.  Additionally, a) upon adoption by
Pontiac Township and Eppards Point Township of the Area-wide Stormwater
Management study prepared by Farnsworth & Wylie (the ""Study"") for the
Property and the surrounding area and b) upon written agreement to proceed
with the stormwater management improvements identified in the Study by those
property owners whose properties are identified by the Study as requiring
stormwater management improvements, Titan shall commit to make those
stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the Property.
Titan shall provide a corporate guaranty to the County in the amount of
fifty-five thousand dollars ($55,000) with a C.P.I. as security for making
those stormwater management improvements identified in the Study for the
Property.  Titan shall construct such improvements contemporaneously with
other such improvements being completed in the Study area.

9. Construction of each phase of the Facility from initiation to
completion is estimated to require from six (6) to twelve (12) months
subject to weather constraints, acts of God, materials availability, strikes
and other labor issues, changes in regulations affecting development and
construction, and other constraints not within the control of Titan.  Within
twelve months following issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy all
improvements shall be completed and all construction equipment and trailers
shall be removed.

thanks for being a sport about it, especially when your dvelope rtypes are
needig to get on down the road.. Please feel free to work on this, but
please  don't distribute this as our form, as you can see from the note

work is limited to speific content here and there, typos ,and some
litigation sturff. The structure will remain, so you can safely work into
this the West LB stuff.

John R. asked that  you and he have a chat about the directionyou are

1739,"Attached are files incorporating suggested revisions for the change order to 
Contract 24-LM6K-2-99 for the purchase of a generator step-up transformer for 
the Pleasanton Project.

In lieu of the Exhibit A of the draft you sent out, I have substituted 
Exhibit A, the GE proposal dated October 9, 2000.

I have substituted Exhibit B, GE's standard specifications for generator 
step-up transformers, for the EE&CC specifications in the earlier draft. GE's 
proposal is quoted on the basis of their standard GSU transformer 
specification. I have this only in hard copy and have a call into GE to 
verify this is the applicable standard and whether it is available in

Kay's venting for the day:

Is it nitpicking to expect outside counsel to (1) make sure the option 
agreement is signed AND acknowledged (2) ascertain whether the thing has the

1745,"Hi Charlotte,

I'm glad you wrote, as I was going to write you.

Michael has strep (as do I), so he and I are home today.  He is on two 
antibiotics which he takes twice a day.  I'm trying to figure out how to get 
these to you, since these have to be refrigerated.  Obviously, if Michael  
isn't doing great I won't go.  Currently, he feels fine, and only feels bad 
when he has fever. He woke up with fever again this am, but the fever should 
go away after 24 hours on the antibiotics.  Just let me know if you aren't 
comfortable with  the situation.  I can always leave on Saturday, or not at 
all.

Michael's doctor is Rey Calderon 713 520 9550.  His wife (and assistant) is 
Delores, and they are wonderful about returning calls, etc.

We will be staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, 210 647 1234. Saturday 
night I will be staying in Round Rock (going to Paige's homecoming in 
Georgetown), but Neil will still be at the Hyatt.

Michael says hi, by the way.  He is watching me type this.

1751,"Enron: Withdrawing 300 MW From Summer Peaking Program
Wednesday, November 1, 2000 02:18 PM	

	
	
	?Mail this article to a friend 
	
	(Corrected 1:59 pm)
	
	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In response to new California power market rules 
proposed Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Enron 
Corp (ENE, news, msgs) has canceled some new generator projects it was 
discussing with the state's electric grid operator, Enron said. 
	The generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to 
300 megawatts of new generation installed in California next spring, Enron 
said. The company, however, continues to negotiate other new generator 
projects with the California Independent System Operator. 
	The FERC Wednesday proposed limiting the California Power Exchange's price 
setting mechanism to $150 a megawatt-hour. The preliminary order could become 
a federal mandate by the end of the year, after the FERC takes comments from 
the public, or it could be modified. 
	Enron and 13 other companies, meanwhile, are in final negotiations with the 
ISO for the new peaking capacity for next summer. The ISO plans to pay a 
total of $255 million a year for three years to the power companies for 
installing the new generators, which the power companies will own. 
	In addition, California's three investor-owned utilities would pay the 
generators for any electricity the new generators produce. Pricing for the 
power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state-chartered 
CalPX. 
	""There's too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost 
associated with those specific projects. For the purposes of making capital 
commitments, we view this as a $150 price cap,"" Enron's Mark Palmer said. 
	Earlier Wednesday, the ISO's chief operating officer, Terry Winter, expressed 
concern that FERC's proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects. 
	FERC's proposals Wednesday are the result of a two-month investigation of 
California's wholesale electricity market, where prices this summer were 
three times what they were a year earlier. To meet the state's rising demand 
for power, California's three utilities have paid billions of dollars more 
than anticipated to independent power producers in order to keep the lights 
on. 
"
1752,"I believe I was told Richmond.




"
1753,"Attached is a draft of the CA for Peoples based on Gregg Penman's information 
below.  Gregg says he also wants some language to be included regarding audit 
rights.  I did not include this language because I'm not sure how to word it 
(and I could not find an example).

By the way, I used another People's CA I got from Ed's directory as an 
example because it seemed to fit better than the one I got from you on Friday.

Gregg wanted some pretty specific reference to the confidential data being 
supplied to Peoples, and most of the examples I reviewed were more general.  
Please let me know what I need to change.

FIVE GREAT LESSONS:

1 -   Most Important Lesson - During my second month of nursing school, our 
professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed 
through the questions,until I read the last one: ""What is the first name of 
the woman who cleans the school?"" Surely this was some kind of joke. I had 
seen the cleaning woman several times.  She was tall, dark-haired and in her 
50s, but how would I know her name?  I handed in my paper, leaving the last 
question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last 
question would count toward our quiz grade. ""Absolutely,"" said the professor. 
""In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They 
deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say 
'hello'."" ""I've never forgotten that lesson.  I also learned her name was 
Dorothy.

2 - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain. One night, at 11:30 PM, an 
older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway 
trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down and she 
desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next 
car.  A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those 
conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance 
and put her into a taxi cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down 
his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's 
door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A 
special note was attached. It read: ""Thank you so much for assisting me on 
the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my
clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able 
to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away.  God 
bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others."" Sincerely, Mrs. Nat 
King  Cole.

3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve. In the days 
when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel 
coffee shop and sat at a table.  A waitress put a glass of water in front of 
him.
""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked. ""Fifty cents,"" replied the 
waitress. The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the 
coins in it. ""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he inquired. By 
now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing 
impatient. ""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely replied."" The little boy again 
counted his coins.  ""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he said.  The waitress 
brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy 
finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came 
back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly 
beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies - You see, he 
couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a 
tip.

4 -  Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path. In ancient times, a 
King had a boulder placed on a roadway. then he hid himself and watched to 
see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest 
merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.  Many loudly 
blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about 
getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load 
of vegetables. Upon
approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move 
the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he 
finally succeeded.  After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he 
noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse 
contained many gold coins and a note from the king  indicating that the gold 
was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant 
learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an 
opportunity to improve our condition. 

5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts. Many years ago, when I 
worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz 
who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her only chance of 
recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who 
had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies 
needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her 
little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his 
blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a 
deep breath and saying, ""Yes, I'll do it if it will save her."" As the 
transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we 
all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew pale 
and his smile  faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling 
voice, ""Will I start to die right away?"" Being young, the little boy had 
misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister 
all of his blood in order to save her. You see, after all, understanding and 
attitude, are everything."

"
1779,"I have made changes for ""97-10"" compliance to the last draft I have of 
Karen's redline.   The gist of the changes is that the Owner is a beneficiary 
under the contract, but has minimal obligations thereunder.   The 
Construction Manager has most of the obligations, but cannot provide the 
indemnification EECC is used to seeing from their counterparty.  

Lisa - there may be spots where you do or do not want the Owner mentioned - I 
tried to limit it to when the Owner was a beneficiary, but that may strain 
some of the legal relationships - we may need to change a few of the 
references.   Accounting may have some objections to the way some things are 
phrased also.

I think we can get there with EECC, but it will take some work.  John is

"
1782,"Ben:

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Plano TSS.  In 
addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant 
level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano.  Under the 
guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are 
required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) 
in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.  If 
we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes 
the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

1791,"Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able 
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The 
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone 
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the 
equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that an 
equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.  Can 
you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

We have enclosed initial drafts of the following documents:

 1. Letter Agreement for the Turbine Transaction (clean copy and
blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the
turbine letter agreement with Coral);

 2. Letter Agreement for the Transformer Transaction (clean
copy, blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of

reflect revisions from the turbine letter agreement referenced as item no. 1
above);

 3. Limited Liability Company Agreement (clean copy and
blacklined copy marked to reflect revisions from the current draft of the
LLC agreement for CA/ED-II).

As mentioned on the telephone, I have retained a number of the
representations and warranties requested by Coral, with modifications where
necessary to eliminate those aspects which were objectionable to Enron.  The
justification for this is that nearly any purchaser would insist on such
representations, and it is often more advantageous to present a draft that
appears to be neutral, rather than allow the counterparty to focus on what
is not there and then have the advantage of drafting precisely what it
wants.  Therefore, we suggest that Enron carefully review the
representations and warranties in order that any objectionable items can be
eliminated before circulation of documents to the counterparty.  Because we
rearranged and reorganized the representations and warranties to make a more
clear presentation, the blacklined drafts will not be very helpful fur
purposes of reviewing representations and warranties.

Please review the enclosed at your convenience and advise of any comments.
Thank you.

1816,"I have reviewed the Transformer and Turbine Letter Agreements I received 
today.

Transformer Letter

2(a) & 3(e):  why is there usage of ""ABB et al."" when ABB is defined?  Also, 
the ""certain agreement"" referred to in both sections is NOT between ENA and 
ABB.  It's now between E-Next Generation LLC as purchaser, ENA as agent for 
purchaser, and ABB, as amended.

3(a):  have two sets of ""(i), (ii)"" in para.  It's also unclear what this 
para actually says.

4:  definition of ""Term"" should go after (b) no?


Turbine Letter

3(a):  Para is clearer than in Transformer but still difficult to understand.

3(f):  Don't understand this para. and what happens with the final payment 
due to GE.

3(g):  the ""certain agreement"" is not between GE and ENA.  See first comment 
under Transformer Letter.  There is also the usage of ""et al."" after GE.

1819,"As soon as I hit the ""send"" button I recalled another issue.  Enron does not 
want the LLC used for anything other than the 
acquistion/disposition/adminstration of the equipment.  Other development 
activities should be conducted in another entity, at least so long as Enron 
has an ownership interest.  I'm going to double check this, as it seems the

Thomas, I had some correspondence faxed to you today.  In it SW is clearly 
taking the position that the damage to the generator occured after delivery 
under the contract.  I thought you addressed that well in your memo, however, 
I have another question.  What impact does the use of DDP (Incoterms) have?  
Is it just one more part of the contract to be taken as a whole, or might it 
have some greater significance?  

Will the passage of ROL impact the LD claim?  I assume not, but I want a 
sanity check.

"
1821,"I have not yet received all of InterGen's comments on the documents,
however, to expedite matters, I am passing on some additional comments
on the letter agreements and the form of Facility Agreement to be
attached to the letter agreements.

Letter Agreements:  Sections 3(a) and 3.(b) of all three letter
agreements should be revised as noted in the attached form of letter
agreement.

Facility Agreements:

1.  The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of each of the Facility
Agreements should be amended to read as follows:

""If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the
Purchase Amount) is greater than the Proper Scope Value the difference
between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the ""Refund Amount"")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below.""

This is the same comment I made earlier.

2.  Exhibits B-1 and H-2 are blank and the corresponding exhibits from
the master GE sales agreement should be attached to the Facility
Agreement.

3.  The cross-reference to Exhibit N-1 should be deleted from Exhibit I
as Exhibit N-1 was deleted from the Facility Agreement.

4.  Exhibit R is blank, however, it is unclear whether this Exhibit is
still relevant.

5.  Exhibit U appears to be incomplete and the reference back to
Section 10.8.4 is unclear.  I believe Tom Seigler brought this up point
up with Ben before Coral left the proposed transaction.

6.  The references throughout the Exhibits to ""oF"" should be corrected
to contain the degree symbol.

1826,"Kathleen - This e-mail should aid in the preparation of the Board 
Resolutions.  The attached file lists the appointment changes.  As for my

enovate, L.L.C., Enron MW, L.L.C. and I suppose Enron North America by 
association.  The dollar amount can be set as low as practical.  I think in 
the L.L.C. agreement the Board reserves the right to approve contracts in 
excess of $50,000.  The real need is for pushing paper such as CA's, Master 
Purchase Agreements, etc.  Here is another question, if my authority is 
limited, who has the authority to sign in excess of my limit?  Laura Luce 
previously had such authority as General Manager (she is a VP at ENA).  If 
she now becomes the Board Member, can she also sign on behalf of enovate?  If 
so, is that because she is an officer of Enron MW or because she is a Board 
Member (i.e., can Peoples Board Member sign on behalf of enovate)?

to the lease accounting rules and other stuff specific to Turbine Torture.  
Do you have any follow up questions from last week you want me to ask?

dropped the ball on that one, although I wish I had expedited them more.  I 
still haven't heard from Kent, despite email, voice mail, and calling Lee.  I 
hope he is ok, because being non-responsive is not Kent's style at all.

1833,"Carolyn,

On the insurance, I would prefer that we go with set insurance requirements, 
$10m in coverage (without aggregate), deductible no greater than $25,000 for 
which they are responsible.  We also need a Best rating of A-XIII or better. 
Also, we need a specific reference to the fact that the new member will be 
responsible for the insurance required in article 19.2 of the turbine 
contract.  The certificate of insurance should be a buyer deliverable at 
closing.

Would it be better to address our ability to put the member interest to them 
on or before [some date- maybe Dec 02], just to get it on the table? 

Term- I'm thinking we may want to be indemnified for longer than 60 days 
after commercial ops, as a claim could be brought against us for something 
they did (and for which we should be indemnified) for longer than that, but 
we would be out of luck, except to the extent insurance took care of it.  
Maybe we should address reps/warranties separate from indemnities, with the 
indemnities lasting longer.

I'd make the confidentiality agreement last for 2  years in this deal.

I'd broaden 9 (xii) to include the acquisition of the equipment, not just the 
facility agreement.

14.  I would reformulate 14 to negotiate around the statement that the 
equipment is being acquired from ENA.  I would also eliminate ""or any other 
third party"" on the fifth line.

Defined terms:  ""Commercial operations"" isn't in the definitions of the 
turbine contract, although there may be a definition imbedded in their 
somewhere (an EECC specialty).  Please verify.

Do we intend to attach a form LLC agreement?

"
1838,"I spoke with Marvin today, he has comments on the LOI.  David Hunt will 
finally be available on Wednesday to work with Kay to address legal issues.  
Bob Priest is recommending Enron to his board tonight.    Due to their peaker 
deal with Aquilla, they have been unable to make progress on our LOI, so it 
will not be presented at his board meeting Tuesday night.  He has them on 
notice that special meeting may be called to execute the LOI as early as a 
week from today.  He would like to be in agreement on the LOI issues by the 
end of this week.

He has the following comments on the LOI:

? page 4 paragraph 8, ""negotiate"" rather than ""negotiates""
? we need clarification on the mechanism by which Enron will recover 
infrastructure costs.  He wants to make sure that Enron cost recovery is out 
of our 40% and backed up by a guaranteed monthly minimum calculated as the 
amoritized capital costs over the contract period.
? he wants more detail on the $50k breakup fee.  What are the circumstances 
that would precipitate a payout?
? David Hunt and Kay Mann need to get together (he indicated that David has 
been unavailable) to address the legal issues including limitation of 
liability and arbitration such that they agree with Mississippi law.
? he needs some specifics on the ancilliary services (load following, 
regualtion, and reserves).

On the last issue, he indicated that this is the ""deal maker/breaker.""  He 
offered that our competition indicated that their regulated side would be 
providing those services.  He needs to know from Enron who we would contract 
with to do it--""we can horse trade on the price later.""  I indicated that we 
have not given specifics to the market in searching for ancilliary services, 
and were waiting on the LOI before we asked for proposals.  He wants 
specifics--other than pricing--before he signs the LOI.


After talking with Ozzie and Lloyd, here is the game plan:

? get the Entergy tariff and price the ancilliary services with Entergy as 
the provider
? find out who the high-load-factor IPPs are in the Mississippi area
? put calls in to those IPPs as well as CLECO, LEPA, SMEPA, Cajun, Alabama 
Electric Power Co-op, and Entergy and guage interest and potential pricing 
for providing ancilliary services
? we will need approximately 4 MW of regulation service, load following and 
reserves.  We would send the signal and communicate with the ancilliary 
service provider.
? Once we have gathered some preliminary information, call Marvin on 
Wednesday and let him know that we expect to go with Entergy during the first 
60 days beginning May 1 and select/negotiate/contract with one of the above 
for the balance of the contract.  In no case would the pricing be higher than 
the entergy tariff rates.

I would like to have Christi and Lloyd available for the call to Marvin.

How does all this sound??

"
1839,"
What about this?  Is this the QSE defn? [Rorschach, Reagan]  No, that would be Qualified Scheduling Entity that has a very lengthly ERCOT definition.  This was greatly simplified to eliminate any confusion.  I think it is OK as is. 

""Scheduling Entity"" means an entity contemplated to be recognized by SPP, and fully qualified under SPP rules and regulations, to schedule the transmission of Energy, Capacity and Ancillary Services from the Facilities.


"
1840,"Please respond to 
Kay:  
 
Attached is a redlined redraft of the  preambles identifying the parties.
 - MDEA ESMA 1st page redraft.doc "
1841,"p. 8 ""Electric Transmission""  -- Would be interesting to find out what the 25 
MW of firm transmission is that Entergy ""committed to.""  Also, a customer 
does not have transmission until it is confirmed on OASIS.  Either PTP (firm 
or non-firm) or the additional off system resources (have to list a source) 
under network would need to be purchased for wheeling in and out of Entergy 
to make parking/lending effective. 

p.9 ""Delivery Point""   --This point is actually the ""POR"" /Point of Receipt 
for tariff purposes if generating the power or the POD/Point of Delivery if 
wheeling into Clarksdale.

p. 10  says that EPMI would manage the existing firm transmission rights.  As 
of now, I don't think Clarksdale has the transmission rights (since Marvin is 
submitting the request today).  Therefore, for contract purposes, want to 
have language that gives them the risk of not getting transmission approved 
by Entergy.  Firm can be difficult to obtain.  Can also include a provision 
that non-firm could be used, if available, but EPMI probably does not want to 
take any transmission risk.  Non-firm is close to non-existent in the 
summer.  

p. 12  Be careful about using the term ""balanced schedules"" for supply, load 
and transmission capacity from all entities it serves.  We are fighting any 
RTO requirements for day ahead balanced schedules.  NERC in May is 
considering changes certain rules that would allow marketers, etc. the 
advantages of parking and lending through the submission of schedules 
(although it probably won't pass.)  In any event, I think that ""appropriate 
schedules, as required by the SPP (or successor organization) rules, 
practices, etc...."" is safer language.

Thanks.  




"
1842,"Jeff and Kayne,

Attached are the contract Exhibits for Asset Management Services and 
Scheduling Services.  Please look at each bullet item and write some specific 
detail about what it is exactly we are committing to.  The driver behind this 
is the legal position Mississippi law puts us in with respect to 
consequential damages--we need to be very clear about what it is we are going 
to do.  For example, it is not enough to say that we will do ""load 
forecasting.""

We need to put the detail behind ""load forecasting.""  For example  ...""EPMI 
will create a load forecasting model and perform load forecasting for MDEA 
using historic energy load data and corresponding historic ambient 
temperature data provided by Clarksdale and Yazoo City.  The model will be 
based on the highly positively correlated realtionship between energy load 
and ambient temperature.  Energy load will be forecasted using the National 
Weather Service forecasted temperatures for the Clarksdale and Yazoo CIty 
areas.  The energy load at each city will be forecasted seperately and 
aggregated as the MDEA energy load.  The MDEA energy load forecast will be 
calcualted weekly and revised daily.""

1859,"Mike,

I agree with your assessment on keeping tabs on them but currently I don't 
see any real opportunity or decision to spend time or money with this 
effort.  I have received feedback from others in the group as well and they 
agree with our general thinking.  Have you talked with Louise lately?  We are 
announcing today that we will be pushing our pricing to other platforms in 
the US (therefore we keep all the liquidity of their markets).  Maybe this 
will apply to these guys, someday.  Certainly it is not appropriate now and 
with your domination concerns it might scare them even more.

My time is very limited next week and I am double booked most of the time.   
I'm out Wed - Sunday and then the analyst meetings begin after that.  I 
really don't have time to meet with them especially if there is not real deal 
pending.  Is there someone else that is more appropriate, maybe someone can 
take them through EOL?  If you like that, please call Louise and co-ordinate.

Thanks,
Mike

1860,"Thanks for the input. We'll add.  Point of clarity: the employees who have 
company-paid computers at home today typically have surplus older equipment 
(except for executives) and have management approval to use for business 
use.  The ENhome program is a different offering which does not require 
business purpose and the equipment will be new.

Thanks again for the input.





"
1861,"FYI.  Note that in spite of the positive report, the Dabho breakwater is 
still seriously behind schedule and, unless something changes radically, we 
will be entering the 2002 monsoon period with only about two-thirds of the 
breakwater complete.  DPC may not be able to take its 2002 volumes and will 
either face take-or-pay or (hopefully) force3 majuere relief if the 
breakwater delay can be attributed to construction force majeure.

This will be both a problem and an opportunity for us, because we may be able 
to get access to the DPC ship (if lenders permit it) and to cargoes to be 
remarketid on behalf of DPC.

As discussed, attached please find the list of museums and coporate/public
collections in which Jeff Koons is represented.
Given the conservative nature of many of the corporate/public collections as
well as the prestigious nature of the museums, I think there should be no
issue with regard to the controversy of Koons' work.  I look forward to
hearing from you as soon as you talk to Skilling and am available to chat
before that even if you would like.  You should also feel comfortable
calling Ned on this topic.  His number at work is:  713-525-9401.

1873,"One Texas Soldier
A large group of Taliban soldiers  are moving down a road when they hear a
voice call from behind a sand  dune.
""One Texas  soldier is better than ten Taliban"".
The Taliban commander quickly orders  10 of his best men over the dune
whereupon a gun-battle breaks out and continues  for a few minutes, then
silence.
The voice once again calls out ""One  Texan is better than one hundred
Taliban"".  Furious, the Taliban  commander sends his next best 100 troops
over the dune and instantly a huge gun  fight commences. After 10 minutes of
battle, again silence.
The Texan voice calls out again ""One  Texan is better than one thousand
Taliban"".
The enraged Taliban commander  musters 1000 fighters and sends them to the
other side of the dune. Rifle fire,  machine guns, grenades, rockets and
cannon fire ring out as a terrible battle is  fought....  Then silence.
Eventually one badly wounded Taliban  fighter crawls back over the dune and
with his dying words tells his  commander,  ""Don't send any more men......
its a trap.  There's two of  them"".

1884,"Errol,

Could you take a look at these two Option/Call deals that successfully 
bridged into Tagg( 750242/QK1859 & 750296/QK1897).  Also, take note that the 
swaps did not bridge into Tagg as requested ( 750297 & 750243), and will 
remain in failed status until further notice.  Everything looks great on our 
end!

One deal failed simply because John Arnold logged in as the buyer and acted 
as the seller.  This only happened once. ( 750209 Option, and 750210 Swap)

Torrey,

What is the plan for all swaps that have been requested to end up in failed 
status ?

The following are revisions to the final report for April 2001.  I am 
providing details here, and the updated report is also attached.  

Tom Brown Resources Ltd., CP ID 96309 is the result of an amalgamation with 
Stellarton Energy Corporation, CP ID 64040.  Stellarton Energy Corporation 
will be inactivated on 05/01/01.  Have Certificate of Amalgamation and 
Articles of Amalgamation in hand.

Please also note that the Western Area Power Administration-""Upper Great 
Plain"" record, CP ID 81177, will be corrected to read ""Western Area Power 
Administration-""Upper Great Plains Region"".  The record that was overlayed 
per the report, CP ID 35194, will be inactivated as a duplicate record.  
These changes have been included on this revised report and the changes have 
been made in GCP today.  These are branch locations by geographic area of the 
US Dept. of Energy, and there is no documentation for these changes.

I have also just received a name correction that may as well be included in 
this report -
      From Greer Comm. of Public Works, CP ID 36393, to Commission of Public 
Works, City of Greer




Please call me with any questions or concerns.

1896,"After our meeting today the change has been approved and will be put into production no earlier than November 9, 2001 and no later than November 19.  Again, this change will in no way restrict trading activity.  It's function is to limit the number of unintentional errors when entering a trade (due to back dating a trade).  The warning screen that exists will now appear when a date is entered on a deal that is prior to today's date.

1902,"Errol, thanks for writing.  I discussed this matter with George Huan this 
morning, in person, and he tells me that he rebooked the deals originally 
booked to El Paso Merchant Energy Gas - L.P. to El Paso Merchant Energy L.P. 
correctly in his spreadsheet pretty late last night after you spoke with him 
and so it did not get into our system last night.  He has assured me, 
however, that everything is in order for tonight's run and that the problem 
should be fixed Monday.  I will advise you if the situation is unresolved 
Monday.  Thanks for your follow up.  Sue.

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.
3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.
4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

1948,"Hi Rev. Jackson

How's it going?  I'm sure I'll be seeing you tonight at choir rehearsal, but 
I was curious if anything new happened on the choir director front?

Let me know if you get this e-mail in time to respond.  I'll be leaving at 
5:00 directly.

See you tonight!"
1949,"Melba

Please set up the following new delivery points:

1) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Midwestern Gas 
Transmission Company located in Will County, Illinois

2) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Natural Gas 
Pipeline Company of America located in Grundy County, Illinois

3) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Nicor Gas 
Company located in Grundy County, Illinois

4) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Peoples Gas 
Light and Coke Company located in Will County, Illinois

5) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline 
Company located in Will County, Illinois

I'd like to have these the Natural Gas Pipeline point set up yet today, as I 
think we will probably start to trade this point tomorrow.

Thank you.

1950,"Yes, Sorry, forgot to mention it to you, but nothing was set in stone.    In 
fact, I initiated the invitation on behalf of me and you.  Are you free?, are 
they free?, I don't even know if I'm free.  What did they say?"
1951,"What's up with this guy.  I guess he called Mr. Palmer.  How did that come 
about!  He really feels as though he's been mistreated.  I don't understand 
him!"

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Freight Markets
Despite an eroding economy and increasing scrutiny of Enron, Enron Freight Markets finished a record month in October, completing more than 4,000 transactions (50% growth from September) and adding over 200 new counterparties.  Volumes were especially strong in the last 10 days of the month.  One of the big sources of transaction growth was increased volume from other major freight intermediaries, substantially bolstering EFM's efforts to develop a wholesale market.

Enron Global Markets
Coal 
Increased liquidity in the prompt months has brought more players into the spot rail market. Traditionally a thin market in the OTC market, the coal group is capitalizing on increased interest by introducing several new EOL rail products. On the CSX rail line, there will be two 12,500 btu products with different sulfur contents - 1.2 pound (or compliance) and 1.6 pound. The CSX contract will be FOB rail in the Big Sandy or Kanawha rail districts. On the Norfolk Southern rail line, there will be two similar 12,500 btu products, however, FOB rail in the Thacker or Kenova rail districts. The coal group intends to bring these products on line within a week for the cash book, and hopefully extend them to the forward markets.

Enron Industrial Markets
Lumber
Enron's Lumber Trading Group recorded a record 33 transactions on Clickpaper.com for the week ended November 11, 2001 for a gross notional value of approximately $1,200,000. This compares to the group's prior weekly average of 5 online transactions with a notional value of approximately $140,000.

The increase in activity is due to the launch of the Lumber Group's New Futures-Like Fixed Price Forward Contracts, which began trading last week.

""We are very excited about the overwhelming market acceptance of our new Forward Contracts which we expect will revolutionize the way lumber is traded"" says John Jacobsen, a manager with EIM's Lumber Trading Group.  We expect to see continued increases in our online trading activity as we start actively marketing them. What makes this week's activity even more promising is the fact that the cash market has been fairly quiet due to the uncertainty surrounding a softwood lumber dispute between the US and Canada.""

Enron Wholesale Services Best Practice Tips

Ordering/Locating SkyTel/Blackberry Items in the iBuyit eProcurement Catalog
Pagers and Accompanying Service Plans:
EWS eProcurement users should go to the catalog under Office Supplies. Enter ""Skytel pagers"" as the Quick Search text. Tip:  All users must select a service plan in addition to the pager.

Handheld Devices:  
EWS eProcurement users should go to the catalog under IT Hardware. Enter ""Blackberry"" as the Quick Search text.  Tip: No need to select a separate service plan. A service plan is combined in the catalog with each handheld device.

Information Required When Ordering SkyTel Items
Pagers and Handheld Devices:  The user's EID* and name are required for all SkyTel items. After adding the item(s) to the Shopping Cart, the requester must click the Line Item Details icon (magnifying glass) and enter the user's EID and name under the Purchase Order Text tab. The order cannot be processed without this information. This will ensure that the ongoing monthly service plan charges are assigned correctly to the user's cost center.
*If EID is unknown, users should go to eHRonline to view their EIDs. 
Tip: If you wish to swap out a pager for a handheld device, make sure to include your existing pager phone number in the PO Text.


NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Update on Enron Europe 
Following on from last week's memo on the health of the business, here's a snapshot of the activities we are pursuing currently to provide customers and investors with confidence in our business:

We are continuing to work on trading liquidity, which to date is going well.  We are transacting with most of our counterparties, but we are spending a significant amount of commercial and commercial support time working on putting credit agreements in place.  These credit agreements tend to focus on netting out exposures between different Enron business units (for example UK gas and UK power) and providing collateral arrangements whereby neither one of us can owe more than a pre-agreed amount without starting to ""pay as you go"".

During these tough times, our priorities right now are to: 
       -	Preserve cash (as our credit rating has been downgraded, our ability to keep maximum cash liquidity is critical).
       -	Insure that we are getting paid when we should get paid.  In other words, we are focusing efforts on accounts receivable that should have been paid and are now  overdue (something that is always important, but even more so now).
 -	Reduce our expenses to the greatest extent possible.
 -	Keep making money.

So please let us know how we can help you help us get the job done.

Enron Nordic Energy Restructuring
Enron Nordic Energy last week took steps to restructure its operations with respect to Finland.  Moving forward, Enron Nordic Energy will continue to service the Finnish market from its Oslo office, offering a range of products including portfolio and risk management services.  This move is not indicative of a withdrawal of Enron's business from the Finnish market, but rather has been initiated in an effort to rationalise Enron's functions and services in the region.  

Enron Succeeds in Completing its First Bi-Lateral Power Transaction Inside Italy 
Congratulations are due to the Italian desk for concluding its first power transaction inside Italy.  The team succeeding in buying 5MW of peak energy for December 2001 from Italian wholesaler, Energ.it, and are selling it to Enel Trade, the trading arm of the incumbent energy company, ENEL.  Energ.it is mainly active in Sardinia and off-takes power from the AES plant in Ottana, Sardinia.  ""Although this is only a small deal it demonstrates the market's appetite to transact."" says Daniela Uguccioni, Enron's Italian power trader.

""Due to the slow progress of liberalisation in Italy, we are still limited to doing back-to-back transactions such as this, however this is definitely a step in the right direction"" adds Paul Mead, Director of Regional Power Trading.  ""The exciting part of this deal is that ENEL will now trade with us inside Italy, something we have been trying to do with them for years.""

New Online Metals Product
Last week saw the launch by Enron Metals of online 'averaging' contracts for Copper and Aluminium.  'Fixed for Float' and 'Month on Month' averaging contracts are now available for the 'nearby months' (i.e.up to three months ahead) providing a useful tool for hedgers.  The introduction of this product online, which is of particular interest for producers and consumers, came in response to customer demand.  The initial response has been positive as last week saw the first trades and we are already seeing requests for the product to be made available for other metals.

Polish Power Market Gathers Momentum as Enron Signs Second Master Trading Agreement
Enron Poland, which recently closed its first-ever OTC transaction with Poland's largest generator PKE, has signed a second Master Trading Agreement with one of the top ten regional distribution companies, Energa Gdansk.  The agreement will provide the basis for future bi-lateral electricity transactions.  ""We hope to close our first deal with Gdansk in Q4"", says Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

Power Desk Sees Promising Market Growth
In the energy market, Enron Australia continues to build its presence year-on-year.  Enron Australia's results at the end of the third quarter showed a 50% increase in volumes, an 80% increase in transactions, and a 300% increase in P&L.  The advent of a competitive ancillary services market in Q4 provides scope for increasing the power team's activity further by the end of the year.

Pacific Solar REC Trade
Enron Australia has secured a renewable energy deal with Pacific Solar, a company that is developing solar photovoltaic systems for the rooftops of the world. The transaction gives Enron the right to purchase all of the renewable energy certificates (RECs) generated by the PV units sold in Australia. Pacific Solar is also selling its systems in Europe though Italian company, Eurosolare. The deal is the first exclusive offtake agreement Enron has secured in the nascent Australian REC market.

IN THE NEWS

In these challenging times, Enron deserves our thanks=20
Houston Chronicle, October 28, 2001  By BILL WHITE=20
Enron and its employees have blessed Houston, and many Houstonians should n=
ow take the time to say ""thanks"" when the company has experienced some high=
ly publicized challenges. Enron attracted thousands of great people to Hous=
ton and changed Houston's economy forever. The company's management encoura=
ged their employees to be active citizens, and those folks responded by mak=
ing a big difference in their community.=20

Enron's lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a=
 multibillion-dollar new industry, with Houston as its hub. Even while it c=
ompeted hard to win in the marketplace, Enron's example helped show other n=
atural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger mark=
et of electricity

This explosive growth attracted bright young people -- and they in turn hel=
ped fuel an explosion in residential growth in Houston's downtown. This, in=
 turn, helped revitalize downtown's retail and restaurant scene. Enron's co=
nstruction of a large Class A office tower, still going up, is a milestone =
in Houston's growth, an official end to more than a decade of large amounts=
 of vacant office space.=20

Enron's corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees =
who have lived the American dream. Enron rewarded innovation, while many fi=
rms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded. Y=
ear after year, top executives throughout the country voted Enron our natio=
n's most innovative corporation. Enron recognized, even when financial mark=
ets do not, that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional fa=
ilure and the inevitable price of other successes.=20

And so if Enron experiences problems, it will learn from them, just as stro=
ng people do. Let's not prejudge Enron's current challenges. The more than =
a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies wh=
o hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but ne=

Throughout its years of success, Enron folks have never forgotten to find s=

As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization.  We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today.  Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along.  It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday.  Approval from the judge is expected.  I have a meeting in the next couple of hour where I will get more details.  Stay tuned ...

1974,"Please plan on attending a meeting on Wednesday January 2nd at 11 AM in Mt. Hood.

During the first two weeks of January we would like to hold training sessions for people in our office.  The goal is to provide an overview of each major function in our office to anyone who is interested in learning about what goes on here.  My current thinking is to spend an hour each day, say from 11 AM until noon, in training.  One or more people from each group will be responsible for coming up with an outline/agenda and leading an hour long session on what you do.  If you have received this e-mail, you have been tentatively nominated by me to lead or co-lead one of the training sessions.

Here are the sessions that I propose:

Here are some ideas to consider for presentations:
What does your job entail -- important timelines and workflow during the day.
Inputs and Outputs to your job -- information and people
Who are your internal/external customers?
What is the purpose of your job?
Lingo - what is the vocabulary of your job?

At our meeting I would like to brainstorm potential ideas for the presenations and get some group input on what should be covered and how it should be covered.  Thanks for your help with this."

Also if you are indifferent on moving the exposure limits from our previous deal to this deal, I would like to move $25 MM from the old deal to the new.  The old deal will have $10 MM remaining.

1985,"Lorenzo:

I apologize for our tardiness in getting back to you re: your generation project in Baja.  

Here is where we stand with the Centrans arrangement.

1.  I have spoken to Daniel R. Castagnola, a VP in Finance who has worked with Centrans and speaks highly of your business acumen in Central America.  The transactions Enron has done with Centrans to date involve equity transactions whereby any Enron credit exposure was hedged by assets.  So, the financial strength of Centrans was not directly in question.  Daniel indicated that we should look at Centrans independently to establish a transaction in Baja.  To this end, we need financial statements from Centrans to establish credit parameters and prepare a Master Power purchase Agreement that could be used to conduct business.  

2.  Stewart Rosman has contacted CFE re: transmission access in Baja.  CFE has indicated that transmission is available.  We have never purchased transmission in Mexico and although it might be possible to do so, we would prefer if Centrans contracted for it themselves, delivering energy to Enron into the ISO grid at Tijuana, which is an ISO tie-point.  I would expect transmission on this arrangement would cost about $5/MWh.   

3.  Forward Prices - As you know, the longer term price at SP-15 for Peak is about $36.  Off peak is about $24.  After subtracting the cost of transmission, this nets about $30 for peak energy and $19 for off peak to the project in Baja.  I am not sure what your fuel price would be, but it seems unlikely that project economics would be supported by such a price.
Please contact me and let me know if you want to continue efforts to proceed with this project.  If so, we need to obtain your financial statements to proceed with the credit review and set up contracts with Centrans.  
Thanks

1987,"FYI; Recently we successfully negotiated and executed an EEI Master Sales & Purchase Agreement with PP&L Montana.  Per a recent telephone conversation between PP&L and Marcus Nettelton, PP&L and intends is to use the WSPP Agreement for all physical transactions except in the rare instance of entering into a physical MW for MW exchange/swap which we recently completed with them.  Net, net, plan on all transactions with PP&L be ""papered"" under the WSPP unless you and their Trader specifically agree to use the EEI which would be our preference.  Please do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,    John"
1988,"I spoke to my contacts at CFE and had a hard time getting concrete answers out of them regarding transmission availability from Rosarita to Tijuana.  My recommendation is for the developers to talk directly with CFE to try to get the info. THe two contacts are as follows:

Marcos Valenzuela    011-5265-58-15-13
Abelardo Borquez      011-5265-58-15-14


The questions I tried to get answered were:
 
Is there available transmission in the term market?
Can I buy it for a 3-5 year period?
Is there a published rate?

Marcos seemed to indicate he thought it would be available but it was unclear as to whether it would be sold term or what the price was - he made it seem like it was a case by case basis.  I could not provide answers concerning timetable and speicifc location for the plant.

Hi. Hope things are well with you. I wanted to drop a line and say hello as well as to thank you for your extreme generosity   with respect to our wedding. I am humbled by what you are doing for us and know Kate feels the same. I am looking forward to September and know that all will have a great time!
Kate and I are going to CT and NY next week to find a place to live (hopefully). We are planning on renting initially then look to buy later. Real estate is crazy there. I guess it is not much better where you are though. Take care.

2003,"Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.


John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen"
2004,"    By Timothy Gardner
    NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Adding stress to an already
frazzled power market, a nationwide coal shortage could spawn
electricity brownouts in northeastern states and in the West
this summer, experts said on Thursday.
    While coal provides the country with 51 percent of its
power, years of industry underinvestment and record prices for
competing fuels natural gas and fuel oil this year have pushed
utilities' coal stocks to their lowest levels since 1974.
    In January, the last month of available government data,
stocks at electric plants were 94 million tons, 27 percent less
than a year earlier, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the Department of Energy's number cruncher.
    Thin coal stocks compound a U.S. natural gas shortage that
led to rolling brownouts in California last winter. That came
after a failed deregulation plan and amid natural gas infrastructure
bottlenecks. Natural gas prices have fallen
from last summer's all-time highs, but are still nearly twice
what they were last year at this time.
    ""In certain regions we would expect brownouts this summer,""
said Deck Sloan, spokesman for Arch Coal Inc. <ACI.N>, the
nation's second largest coal firm. ""In California that seems to
be a very high likelihood, especially given the situation with
reservoir levels behind the hydro-dams in the West,"" he said.
    Los Angeles has avoided brownouts, largely because it has a
coal cache in Utah. L.A.'s power department is the largest
participant in the 1,600 megawatt (MW) Intermountain Power
Project in Utah. The project supplies L.A. with 14 percent of
its power and lesser amounts to nearby cities Anaheim and
Pasadena as well as parts of Utah.
    One megawatt powers about 1,000 homes.
    Mike Nosanov, the operating agent of the 1,600 MW
Intermountain project, said the plant now has 700,000 tons of
coal, or 60 days supply. ""That's more than enough to keep us
out of trouble this summer,"" he said.  Still, L.A. mayor
Richard Riordan has been meeting with Utah Governor Mike
Leavitt to discuss adding another 500 to 1,000 MW to the Utah
plant, though it would take years to add the capacity.

    OVERLOADED RAILROAD
    Another potential problem is stemming from the nation's
largest coal producing state, Wyoming, which delivers coal to
24 states.
    The two major railroads at Wyoming's Powder River Basin,
Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, operate a joint
line out of the mines that has reached its capacity of 64
trains per day or more than 300 million tons per year.
    ""The two lines could probably carry another 10 to 20
million tons (per year) out of Wyoming's Powder River Basin.
Beyond that it may take additional investment by the railroads
in order to get more production out of the basin,"" said Sloan.
    The Midwest is also thirsty for Wyoming coal. A proposal to
build a $1.4 billion coal rail project from Wyoming to power
plants in the Midwest is in the works.
    Hill and Associates, an independent industry consulting
firm, agrees that Wyoming coal trains are at their limits, a
problem that will take years to solve. ""The question is who is
going to make the investment?"" asked Hill and Associates Vice
President John Hanou. ""The mines or the railroads?""

    COAL DROUGHT ALL OVER
    Northeastern states, where years of production
underinvestment has led to thin stocks, are also in danger,
said Arch Coal's Sloan. ""We could also see the Northeast, if
the summer is normal or hotter than normal, suffer brownouts as
well,"" he said.
    Adding to the mix, Massey Energy <MEE.N>, the nation's
seventh-largest coal company, experienced flooding last month
in one of its major mines in Appalachia.
    ""In this current atmosphere, that is a hell of a big story,
said Jim Thompson, general manager of Energy Publishing, a Hill
and Associates affiliate.
    And the EIA reported utilities so far this year are burning
six percent more coal than last year. Prices on the spot market
have jumped, though long-term contracts make up 80 percent of
coal deals, which mean consumers will mostly be protected from
rising prices.
    But utilities may find themselves scrambling for coal. ""As
far as we can tell there is no coal available anywhere,"" warned
a Hill and Associates supply report this spring.
    ""Brownouts are possible,"" said Lehman Brothers coal analyst
Peter Ward. ""Utilities have gotten complacent. Coal has been a
buyer's market for about two decades. That has suddenly changed
in the past three months, and for many utilities with low
inventories, that is a scary situation.""
    Analysts said high coal prices should eventually spur
increased production of the fuel, and new natural gas and coal
plants will eventually clear up brownout threats. ""But we're
not going to see much capacity come on line for at least three
years,"" said Hanou.

2006,"We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract 
later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we 
haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already 
at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  
If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and

2007,"Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to 
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.

2008,"To all,

I visited with Kam earlier today to revisit the positions in the SE book and 
we discovered the following:

City of Madison transport: transfer to Pete's book for 10/01 and forward
MGAF transport:  write down 2007-2020 position.  Loss of about $500K - Scott 
as we spoke, I'll take the blame
LRC/Stringray positions:  Kam to review and explain
Annuity:    Origination total of about 90K, net with 500 loss from above
Alagasco:   Tammi deal, Sonat Tier 2 position
Others:    As I explained to Kam, any gain from closing this book should be 
transferred for the
    account of Jared Kaiser
            Bank of America
           ABA 0011.....just kidding!  It comes from sitting by Sandra too

2072,"Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000

2096,"Gabrielle Curie Grace
Born:  7/30/00  11:56 p.m.
Weight:  6 lbs.  10 oz.
Length:  19 inches

As  many of you already know, Gabrielle was diagnosed with a congenital heart 
defect called hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which means that the left side 
of her heart did not develop correctly.  Today she is undergoing the first of 
three surgeries designed to re-plumb the heart so that the right side does 
all the work.  This first step is a very dangerous and complicated 
procedure.  The second and third operations will take place at 6 months and 3 
years of age.  Fortunately, Texas Children's Hospital has the best infant 
cardiac department in the country.  

Gabrielle was taken into surgery at 8:30 a.m. and still has a few hours to 
go.  I last spoke to Jim around 2:00 p.m. and he said that things were going 
well, and that there have been no complications.  Jim and Michele wanted to 
express their gratitude for the outpouring of love and prayer.  Let's all 
keep praying and stay optimistic for the best possible outcome!

If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

2206,"In light of recent events, effective IMMEDIATELY, all usage of the Corporate American Express card is restricted to transactions (approved by your management) for business travel at airline, hotel, car rental and restaurant establishments. Transactions attempted at other establishments will be denied at the point of sale.

Effective Friday, December 7th, ALL charge privileges on ALL Corporate American Express Corporate Cards will be suspended indefinitely. There will be NO charge activity allowed on any Card after close of business on Friday, December 7, 2001.

Enron and each cardholder maintain joint liability on all authorized business related charges on the Corporate American Express card. Each individual cardholder maintains sole liability for non-business related charges.

2210,"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

I just found something suprising.

The starting date for settled price data for invidual curves may differ.  

For Example  -- Using an effective date of 1/1/01 price data for the following curves begins on:

To get the data to align propely a prompt month of 4/1/01 can be used.

The earlier sheet doesn't alert you to and simply outputs the pricedata without regard to the date of the 1st available price.  The attached sheet displays the first date pricing is available (after the prompt month) if it doesn't match the prompt month.

2225,"I want to provide you with clarification and some additional information in light of yesterday's announcements regarding Enron's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

In Friday's email, we advised you that the business units will communicate any news regarding elimination of your position, that this information will have been coordinated with the Program in advance, and that it will be definitive.  To be clear, this means that any news regarding whether you will be retained or terminated will be delivered by the business units (not the Program), and it will be final.  Later this morning the business units will begin floor meetings, and will communicate further information and instructions to you.

As a result of these recent events, all activities and responsibilities of the Associate / Analyst Program are being transitioned to Human Resources.  Over the next few weeks, the Program's current HR Generalist Terry Bosien will work with the business units to make this transition as smooth as possible under the circumstances.  Through Friday December 14, please make Terry your primary point of contact for any questions or issues you might have.

Finally, I must say that I'm very proud to have led this Program over the past several months.  I want to thank each member of my team for their hard work and dedication to the many things we've achieved.  I am grateful for the contributions all of you have made to Enron, and I wish you the very best of luck.

With best regards,
Billy

We thought we would clarify the Parking & Mass Transit options:

1) Three options are available:

2WTC/Outside parking lots
- Those who park at 2WTC will continue to be set up with monthly parking deductions
- Those who park in outside lots pay out-of-pocket and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month

Tri-Met
- No out-of-pocket expense or paycheck deduction.

Daily Validations
- Employees may park at any location and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month.

2) You may choose only ONE of these available options.
- If you selected the mass transit option, you must pay out-of-pocket (with no reimbursement) for parking fees incurred on days you choose to drive into the office.

3) If you would like to change your parking/mass transit option, please contact Grace or Julie.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

2252,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com."

This sure sounds like a deal Len Gunderson was looking at early this year and 
a large chemical facility. The capacity for the project did not match what 
equipment it was based on - any more details so I can see if we have any data 
from that earlier look?

2282,"There was an error in the distribution process in the previous memo which 
caused parts of the text to be omitted .  The following is the correct 
message.

The memo below is from our legal group pointing out some lessons we learned 
from our restructure experiences last year.  We fully support the conclusions 
stated in the memo and hope that we can learn from these experiences to 
improve our approach to new transactions.



TO: Cliff Baxter DATE: March 29, 2000

FROM: Mark Haedicke
  Julia Heintz Murray
  Lisa Mellencamp 

RE:  Lessons Learned in the Restructure Group 

 
Establish Benchmarks.  Establish benchmarks for terms and conditions expected 
in debt and security instruments to ensure standard and adequate lender 
protections in the downside case.  The use of non-standard terms and 
conditions negotiated into our documents has made it more difficult to act 
quickly, has increased the legal time and expense involved, has affected the 
liquidity of our investments in the distressed market and has opened the door 
to disagreements with respect to interpretation of provisions in the 
documents.  Non-standard terms and conditions give the other side room to 
argue, where more standard provisions, with more standard and universal 
interpretations, would not.
Approval Process.  Make certain that the approval process highlights and 
justifies deviations from the benchmarks, allows for an examination of the 
pricing of the transaction based on any increased risk as a result of those 
deviations and evaluates any increased legal risk in the downside case.
Hold Firm in Negotiations.  Be tougher in our negotiations of the transaction 
documents after the basic business deal is cut.  We start with a number of 
provisions that get negotiated out when we could hold firm and obtain what we 
need and want.  Deviations from the approved deal should go back through the 
system.
Evaluate for Downside Case.  Evaluate our documents carefully for the 
downside case and price for what controls and options we will have.  What can 
we do if things go south?  See if additional protections or leverage can be 
built into the documentation.  For example, a second lien position gives 
leverage in the downside case.  Also, we should look at preferred equity 
positions with debt-like features.
Prompt Exercise of Remedies.  Be prepared to exercise our remedies quickly 
and to actually do it.  In certain instances verbal waivers have been granted 
without going through any approval process.  Also, we have given waivers too 
easily in some instances which has resulted in other creditors and investors 
receiving more favorable treatment.
Use of Directors.  Consider carefully the use of Enron employees as 
directors.  In some instances having Enron employees as directors on boards 
of companies in which Enron has invested as an equity owner and/or has 
provided financing has hampered our ability to trade our investments and to 
take certain actions that might be in our interest but not the company's 
interest.
Trading Contracts.  Limit the instances when we grant security interests in 
our trading contracts or contractually tie up in any way our ability to 
terminate our trading contracts.  If we do, evaluate carefully the language 
used and have the trading experts involved.  Evaluate carefully the hedging 
strategies employed by the companies in which we invest.  Reevaluate the use 
of master netting agreements.
Use of Proceeds.  Establish tighter use of proceeds provisions.  If we are 
making a significant investment, we need to make sure that the funds are used 
for the designated purposes.  Consider in some instances parceling out the 
dollars as certain hurdles are met.
Proforma Compliance Certificates.  Eliminate disputes about financial 
covenant interpretations and calculations by having proforma compliance 
certificates required as a condition to closing and having the business 
people work through the calculations prior to closing, not after a dispute 
has arisen.
Evaluate Distressed Investments.  Evaluate all the components of our 
distressed investments as a package to see what is in the best interests of 
Enron as a whole and to coordinate strategies.
Pricing.  Evaluate carefully the proposed pricing of a transaction.  Are we 
being adequately paid for our risk?  If the deal does not conform to our 
benchmarks, are we being paid for the deviations?"

2291,"Here is the final portion of the presentation.
Ben
"
2292,"Don,

We got curves and spread option value from Structuring. Ben and I are 
finalising the first model based on following valuation method;

Valuation of Retail Short =
+ 1. Revenue from serving load (to get 12% IRR)
+  2. Expense from serving load at the market
+ 3. Spread option value for full capacity
+ 4. ICAP ($1.00/kw-mo for first 6 months)
- 5. Fixed expenses

Someone may think #2 (Expense from serving load at the market) is redundant, 
which maybe true, but I still think it is not double counting.

#1, 2, and 3 can be written as follows: (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + Max[(Pmkt - MC), 
0]*Capa, where Pees is Energy price charged to EES, Pmkt is Market price of 
power, Lees is EES load, MC is Marginal cost of peaker, and Capa is Capacity 
of peaker. Therefore,

If (Pmkt - MC) < 0, (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees,
If (Pmkt - MC) > 0, (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*Capa, 
   (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees),
   (Pees - Pmkt + Pmkt - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees),
   (Pees - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees).  

This correctly shows our structure, I think. I will try to talk to you today 
after we finish model. Thank you.

Jinsung
(37330)"
2293,"Team,

We need to push forward on the next phase of the pricing model.  I sense that 
we have lost some momentum so we need to pick it back up.

Enron needs to shed some of the risk of this deal in order to be able to do 
more of them.  I think the insurance market is a great platform to accomplish 
this.  I think our success potential is high as long as Enron is in a first 
loss position and pro-rata loss for the balance.  However, I am not confident 
that the insurance industry will be able to work up a meaningful offer.  My 
solution is to calculate a bid for their services.

The loss I am trying to protect is associated with a bankruptcy process where 
Enron seeks to gain control of the underlying asset and/or its liquidation.  
I propose that the trigger for an insurance pay-out would be the sale of the 
underlying project to a third party in a liquidation scenario for the benefit 
of creditors (i.e. EPMI).

I would like to price a structure where EPMI takes the first $50/kw of Loss 
and 10% of the balance.  Loss will be defined as Par amount of debt 
outstanding plus Net Amounts owed EPMI less sale proceeds from plant.  Net 
Amounts owed EPMI will include the net amount of MTM and accrued index 
payments owed EPMI under both the Financial Buy and Financial Sell contracts 
as of the date of sale.  For purposes of this analysis lets assume initially 
that Net Amounts are $0.

One way to price this product would be as a put option of 90% (100% - 10%) of 
the MW of the plant at a price equal to par amount of debt less $50/kw.  I am 
open to other ideas.

I expect results to be presented in the form of reduction of the put premium 
( equity's option to put plant to EPMI) that we have been calculating to date.

It is also essential that we update the pricing models to reflect different 
start and end dates and different strike price calls for each year.

Don

2300," Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.  Also, thank 
you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application 
and talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of the faculty and 
staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the School, my desire to 
attend the School is quite strong.  The School is a perfect fit for the 
career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be 
able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my 
experiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the 
GMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have 
proven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. 
Enron).  I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the 
many people I talked with at the Texas B-School.  
 Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and 
it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in 
Texas, such as myself.

D"
2305,"Team,

We've done a lot of good work lately on the evaluation models and I think we 
are converging on a platform that accurately models the product, the project 
and my structure's risk.  The only remaining issues when we're done will 
relate to the curves.

Just so we're all on the same page, I thought I would lay out the base 
scenario:

Hourly vols
Mid power and oil curves
Beginning debt of $375/kw amortising mortgage style over 20-years
Debt interest rates of T+225
Plant residual value of $100/kw
Enron will own a 50 MW call from 5/2001 to 12/31/2020.  Strike prices will be 
$50/mwh for years 1-5, $75/mwh for years 6-10, and $100/mwh for the balance 
of the term.
The basic put or no put trigger algorithm is (plant value + put option value 
>= par amount of bonds outstanding).  As the model calculates equity's 
decision whether or not to put the plant to Enron, we should reduce each 
years par amount of bonds outstanding by the debt service reserve fund.  This 
proxy's the fact that equity will consider when making their put decision 
each year that there are moneys in the DSRF, working capital reserves and 
equity sweep accounts.
Whatever power/oil correlation's structuring thinks are appropriate.

I hope to see results Monday.  If there are any questions, please call me at 
3-4750.

Don Black"

2316,"Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which I 
look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the 
""preliminary answer"" to your question and should be treated as so. Please 
keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal 
Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept 
that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's 
capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average 
degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the 
total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we 
typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval 
process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers 
that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project 
characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at 
the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed 
these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:

Tom Irwin asked that we contact you each of you directly on behalf of
Allegheny to ask the following environmental due diligence questions that
we have not resolved based on our review of the Dealbench documents.
Please, however, feel free to reference specific documents on Dealbench if
you believe they would be useful.

Questions for All Facilities

1.  What are the limitations on the number of hours that each facility can
operate and what is the source of those limitations?

2.  We understand that there are tentative expansion plans for each
facility.  Were these future expansion plans disclosed to the regulating
agencies at the time that the air permits were applied for, particularly at
those facilities which did not undergo PSD review?

3.  Which facilities are required to perform continuous emissions
monitoring pursuant to its air permits?  For those facilities performing
CEM, please provide the last two years of data.

4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact
statement purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?  We noticed that the
only facility with information about this issue was the pipeline at
Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the pipeline
was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?  What was the outcome of the
EIS process for the pipeline?

5.  What is Enron's understanding of the process required to transfer the
environmental permits for each facility in connection with the proposed
transaction?  For example, the 1995 stormwater permit for LV Cogen appears
to be triggered by a change in control of the facility.  See 6.02.03 at
page 16.  Do other permits have similar provisions?

6.  Will any environmental property transfer or comparable statutes (e.g.
the Illinois Responsible Property Transfer Act) be triggered by the
proposed transaction?

7. We have reviewed the United States Environmental Protection Agency
comments for the air permit at LV Cogen II, as discussed below.  Did U.S.
EPA provide any additional comments on the air permits for LV Cogen II or
any other facility?

Lincoln Facility

1.  Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy.
If not, please explain status.

2.  Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility and, if
so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by future
expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear,
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.

Gleason Facility

1.  Does the Gleason facility have an air operating permit from the
Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation?  If so, please provide
a copy.  If not, please explain status.  We also noticed that the
construction permit expired on October 1, 2000.  See 02.01.02.  Was it
renewed?

2.  What is the status of the petition for variance to the Tennessee
Department of Environment & Conservation for alternative testing and
monitoring methods under NSPS Subpart GG dated April 17, 2000?  See
02.01.04B.  What is the status of the letter requesting a waiver of certain
source emission tests dated April 18, 2000?  See 02.01.04A.

3.  Is there enough water to support an expansion of the facility at
Gleason?  Please provide any testing/analysis that has been performed with
respect to this issue.

Wheatland Facility

1.  We understand that the Wheatland facility may seek a NPDES permit to
discharge wastewater directly to the White River.  How is this wastewater
currently managed?  Why is the facility considering changing the management
method to direct discharge under a NPDES permit?  If there are associated
cost savings with a NPDES permit, what are they estimated to be?  We
understand that the source of the water that is discharged is a pond
associated with mining operations.  Who is the owner of the pond?  Are any
water extraction permits needed to remove water from this pond and, if so,
have they been obtained?  We also understand that sampling was recently
performed of the water.  Please provide copies of this analysis and any
associated documentation.

LV Cogen

1.  The Industrial User Discharge Permit on Dealbench appears to have
expired on July 1, 2000.  See 6.02.02.  Was it renewed?  If so, please
provide copy.

2.  The stormwater discharge permit for LV Cogen appears to be expired.
See 06.02.03.  Was it renewed?  If so, please provide copy.

3.  Does Sunco hold any environmental permits in its own name?  If so,
please provide copies.

LV Cogen II

1.  EPA contends in its March 23, 1998 and March 24, 2000 letters that BACT
for LV Cogen II was SCONOx and/or XONON.  See 06.01.09.1.   How was this
issue resolved?  Can LV Cogen II meet the 2 ppm NOx limit in the draft
operating permit with the technology that has been proposed?  See 06.01.15.

2.  It appears that the State of Nevada has contended that certain
equipment replacement should have undergone new source review in their June
13, 2000 memo.  See 16.03.6.    How was this resolved?  What is EPA's view
on this issue?"
2364,"Hey Dan:
It was good to see you the other day.  It's funny because I had tried to send 
you an e-mail, after talking to Andrew about the paper.  It's great eveything

"
2376,"Gentlemen,

Attached is a list of due diligence questions for the Enron generation
assets (Wheatland, Lincoln, Gleason and LV Cogen).  We would very much
appreciate your help is getting answers for by Friday, 10/20 if possible.

Unfortunately, we are still having significant difficulty in accessing
documents on DealBench.  The download time is usually several minutes to a
half hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully print
out on our systems.  Two of our consultants have experienced similar
difficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are not
unique to systems at PECO.

We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability to
bid on the assets.  Would it be possible to receive from you either a print
out of the documents or the documents on CD ROM?

Something has happen to the disk and we are trying to have systems look into 
it.  Just let Stuart now this and he'll understand.  Thanks
Ben"
2384," Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site 
visits to the plants.  As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday 
and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule.  In 
terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the 
following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and 
Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.  These guys will cover the site visits the 
next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed.
  While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take 
any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager.  
Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per 
day.
 I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling 
please give me a call.  Again, thank you for your help with these issues.
Regards,

Ben"
2385,"I agree that this should be included in the due diligence files but only 
after the confidentiality issue is resolved.  The portion of the contract 
dealing with confidentiality states that information designated as 
""confidential"" must be safeguarded.  It is unclear whether the agreement 
itself constitutes ""confidential"" information and therefore I would suggest 
that the counterparty be contacted in order to obtain permission to disclose 
the draft agreement.  I am nearly certain that they will not have any problem 
as they are likely to want the business from the purchaser of the facility.

2389,"This week I will be arranging site visits for the bidders of Pastoria and LV 
Cogen I and II.  There will be nine bidders for each but not all are the 
same.  Before the first visit, I want to remind you of the confidential 
nature of the process and send you the Site Visit Procedures.

Confidentiality

All aspects of the bidding process are to be kept confidential.  This means 
that you must not disclose to another bidder or any other person:

the name of any bidder, or
any questions asked, or comments made, by any bidder 

If you have any questions regarding a confidentiality issue, contact me and 
Karen Jones or Dale Rasmussen. 

Site Visit Procedures

The attached Site Visit Procedures were distributed to the Phase II bidders 
last week.  Please read them carefully and follow them.  Should you have any 
questions, please call me.

Our internal site visit procedures will be as follows.   As I receive site 
visit requests, I will notify the applicable Site Visit Coordinator - Bill 
WIlliams for LVI and LVII and Sam and Dean for Pastoria - to set the time.

I will receive from each bidder, and will forward to the Site VIsit 
Coordinators, a list of attendees (with a contact number for the bidder's 
site visit coordinator) and the hotel and travel information, as applicable.

Please call me should you have any questions.  Thanks.

of H for summer classes and they did not provide graduate level summer 
classes.  The only school that provided graduate level summer classes was the 
University of St. Thomas.  It would have been nice to take these classes at U 
of H, because our Chairman and CEO and my recommender to The Texas Business

 Thanks again for your response and advice and hope all is going well.

2393,"Dr. Harris:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly, as I felt 
mine did.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have also decided to take another graduate level finance class 
(Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a ""special testing status"" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.  When I hear back from GMAC, I am 
planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase my score.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon.

2401,"Quick comments.  Mike, what are your thoughts on my answer in O5?

I'll provide start numbers for O5 later today.

E2.  No; however, CFR60 subpart GG short term limits still apply 
(approximately 90 ppm NOx) which are well above the turbine emissions.

T1.  ""on any asset"" should read ""of any asset""

O5. Since commercial operations, the Wheatland facility has averaged xx 
starts per machine, and the Lincoln facility has averaged yy starts per 
machine.  The start-up and commissioning process followed a normal startup 
progression.  The Lincoln facility experienced a generator failure in unit #7 
during the first run season.  General Electric replaced the generator under 
warranty provisions.  Sratification of gas flows was observed in the stacks 
at the Wheatland facility during CEMS certification.  The CEMS certification 
was then postponed until Summer '01.

O6.  Wasn't it a strip mine?  I didn't think it was a coal mine.

2419,"
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

"
2420,"

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00

"
2433,"Ben, please find attached the preliminary O&M estimate for the Lincoln, NE 
project that we discussed. It shows O&M cost estimates for a 20 year period 
assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am 
to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT 
major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease 
Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant 
from the Owner & Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not 
showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what 
they plan to ""charge"" us for the O&M portion of the power they provide us 
during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to 
ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the 
water treatment part). 


Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our 
proforma purposes.

If LES is to provide what they feel the O&M would be, please let me in on 
their numbers so we can provide our experience.

thanks, Scot"
2434,"David Parquet asked me to forward these answers to you:
Question:
Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Answer:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul."

_______________________________________________________________

We appreciate your assistance in providing the responses to the
environmental questions regarding Gleason and the SPCC issue referenced on
the draft schedules.  The following questions are still outstanding,
however, from October 23 and October 25 despite your indication that the
responses to at least the October 23 questions would be available last
week.   Given the fast approaching bid deadline and the importance of the
responses to our due diligence review, we would appreciate receiving the
responses as quickly as possible.  For your convenience, the following is
the list of our outstanding questions:

Questions for All Facilities

1.  What are the limitations on the number of hours that each facility can
operate and what is the source of those limitations?

2.  We understand that there are tentative expansion plans for each
facility.  Were these future expansion plans disclosed to the regulating
agencies at the time that the air permits were applied for, particularly at
those facilities which did not undergo PSD review?

3.  Which facilities are required to perform continuous emissions
monitoring pursuant to its air permits?  For those facilities performing
CEM, please provide the last two years of data.

4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact
statement purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?  We noticed that the
only facility with information about this issue was the pipeline at
Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the pipeline
was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?  What was the outcome of the
EIS process for the pipeline?

5.  What is Enron's understanding of the process required to transfer the
environmental permits for each facility in connection with the proposed
transaction?  For example, the 1995 stormwater permit for LV Cogen appears
to be triggered by a change in control of the facility.  See 6.02.03 at
page 16.  Do other permits have similar provisions?

6.  Will any environmental property transfer or comparable statutes (e.g.
the Illinois Responsible Property Transfer Act) be triggered by the
proposed transaction?

7. We have reviewed the United States Environmental Protection Agency
comments for the air permit at LV Cogen II, as discussed below.  Did U.S.
EPA provide any additional comments on the air permits for LV Cogen II or
any other facility?

Lincoln Facility

1.  Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy.
If not, please explain status.

2.  Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility and, if
so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by future
expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear,
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.

Wheatland Facility

1.  We understand that the Wheatland facility may seek a NPDES permit to
discharge wastewater directly to the White River.  How is this wastewater
currently managed?  Why is the facility considering changing the management
method to direct discharge under a NPDES permit?  If there are associated
cost savings with a NPDES permit, what are they estimated to be?  We
understand that the source of the water that is discharged is a pond
associated with mining operations.  Who is the owner of the pond?  Are any
water extraction permits needed to remove water from this pond and, if so,
have they been obtained?  We also understand that sampling was recently
performed of the water.  Please provide copies of this analysis and any
associated documentation.

LV Cogen

1.  The Industrial User Discharge Permit on Dealbench appears to have
expired on July 1, 2000.  See 6.02.02.  Was it renewed?  If so, please
provide copy.

2.  The stormwater discharge permit for LV Cogen appears to be expired.
See 06.02.03.  Was it renewed?  If so, please provide copy.

3.  Does Sunco hold any environmental permits in its own name?  If so,
please provide copies.

LV Cogen II

1.  EPA contends in its March 23, 1998 and March 24, 2000 letters that BACT
for LV Cogen II was SCONOx and/or XONON.  See 06.01.09.1.   How was this
issue resolved?  Can LV Cogen II meet the 2 ppm NOx limit in the draft
operating permit with the technology that has been proposed?  See 06.01.15.

2.  It appears that the State of Nevada has contended that certain
equipment replacement should have undergone new source review in their June
13, 2000 memo.  See 16.03.6.    How was this resolved?  What is EPA's view
on this issue?

Schedules for LV Cogen I and II

1.  Schedule 4.1(i) references an annual audit of the CEM system in May
2000.  Is this audit on Dealbench and/or can we get a copy of it?

2.  Please provide a copy and/or reference to a Dealbench document for the
Phase I referenced on Schedule 4.1(n).

3.  Please provide copies and/or references to Dealbench documents for the
items listed as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on Schedule 4.1(u).  [Note that we have
reviewed the 1995 storm water permit, but did not see an indication that it
is automatically renewed.  Is this reflected elsewhere?]

Thanks for the response.  We had previously received the response regarding
the SPCC plan issue but I had not seen the responses for the Lincoln
facility (although I had received Gleason last week).  Just to confirm what
is outstanding:  The questions relating to all facilities sent on 10/23,
the questions relating to Wheatland sent on 10/23, the questions relating
to LV Cogen I and II sent on 10/23, and the questions relating to the LV
Cogen I and II schedules sent on 10/25.  Please let me know if this is not
consistent with your understanding of what is outstanding.  Thanks.

2483,"PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

My name David Martin.  I graduated from the MBA/MPA program at UT in May 1998 
and I am currently a Manager at Enron North America in the Restructuring 
Group.  I am writing to you in reference to a Fall 2000 MBA candidate named 
Benjamin Rogers.  He is an Associate here at Enron and in my opinion an 
excellent candidate for the UT MBA program.  He has already submitted his 
application and is anxiously awaiting a response.  Ben came to Enron as an 
Analyst and was recently promoted to an Associate, something not many 
Analysts are able to do.  He has worked in several groups throughout Enron 
and is very serious about the possibility of attending UT.  Please take my 
highest of recommendations into consideration when you assess his entrance 
into the program.  Thank you.

This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of=20

What=01,s Different?
? Your =01+home=01, cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay adv=
ice.=20
This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial module=
s=20

? Any earnings descriptions that start with a =01+P=01, represent earning t=

? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instea=
d=20
of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions wil=
l=20
remain itemized in the deduction section.

? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year=01)to-=
date=20
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the=20
year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This=
=20
change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your=
=20
pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year=
=20
will reflect your earnings by company).

? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick=

My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stan=
d for?
There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For=
=20
some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to=20
print.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions an=
d=20

f all=20
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intrane=
t=20
at eHRonline.enron.com.

What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean?
These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at=20
hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.

Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck?
Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected =
in=20
the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the=20
July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay ad=
vice=20

What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)?
For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit =
is=20
applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to=20
another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amou=
nt=20
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FIC=
A=20
will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.

What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock=

options?
There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This=

As per discussion, I have created a common folder 
o:naes/from_ko/LM6000s/Control, for storage of the cost configuation model 
and finanicial base model.

Since Ben has to model Lincoln by next week, I suggest we use his model as 
the go forward base model from now onwards. By modeling an actual 
transaction, it would be easier for us to identify needed changes and links.

If you guys have time, please look thru the model and list the changes 
needed. We could then have a meeting next week to go through the suggestions 
and discuss how to coordinate taking turns working on the model.


Ben:

I will continue making cosmetic changes to the model for now, but I would 
make sure that the changes do not mess up the economics of the transaction.



Everyone:  

If any of you need to model anything, please use this base model. If you do 
not have access to the directory, please create a security request form 
through lotus notes.

Thanks.

2604,"We are now the ""ENRON 400"" and have been officially notified that we have 
earned first position in the Super Team Start.  That means we are the very 
first out the gate again this year!  AWESOME !  Thanks to all of you for your 
recruiting efforts. We've gained 125 riders from last year.  MEET YOUR TEAM 
IN THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF TULLY STADIUM.  

To start this adventure, just show up with your bike and all your gear at 
Tully Stadium, I-10 & Dairy Ashford no later than 6:00 AM on Saturday, the 
15th.  The feeder road going east on I-10 from Dairy Ashford leads you to 
Tully Toad, dedicated as a one-way street that morning.  Turn right onto 
Tully and enter Tully Stadium grounds in the first 3 gates.  No vehicles of 
any kind  will be allowed into the parking lot from Dairy Ashford, so save 
yourself some time and just follow the crowd in from the feeder road.   
Please park your vehicle and then go ask questions if needed so that you 
don't jam up the entrance.  There are 3 drop-off points for your luggage.  
Each rider should have 2 luggage tags which are the same numbers as your 
helmet and bike numbers.

6:15 AM Team Picture (Southeast Corner of Parking Lot - in the Stadium)
6:30 AM Stage for Exit (Northwest Corner of Parking Lot)
7:00 AM The ""Enron 400"" out the gate!

(You have a Tully Stadium map in your rider manual)

The Top Team Start will be at 7:00 AM, staging at 6:30 AM, and it's very 
important to be there on time.  If you're not in the staging area in time for 
our start, you'll be stuck back with the crowd and it could take you as long 
as two hours to get out the gate.  Allow enough time to park, unload luggage, 
and get geared up, remembering that the freeway will be jammed up even that 
early.   We want you there for the team picture, and we don't want to leave 
without you, so please be there plenty early (I recommend arriving at 5:30 
AM).  Please wear your Enron jersey the first day.  This helps us to quickly 
identify who should be starting with us.  I did consent to let five IZUZU 
riders start with us.  Since they're sponsoring the whole event, I figured 
you guys wouldn't mind.  So just be nice!

If you have any questions about any of this, please email me or call me at 
713-646-6569.  I'll be out of the office the rest of this week in attending a 
conference,  but will be checking messages and email when possible.  My home 
number is 713-977-1527 and cell phone is 713-503-6313.  On Friday I'm picking 
up my kids who are flying in and getting their bikes ready, etc., but call if 
you need anything.

following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=
=20
Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=

technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :

Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=

plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=

groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

AEP COMPLETES PURCHASE OF HOUSTON PIPE LINE COMPANY FROM ENRON
COLUMBUS, Ohio - American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP) announced that it has completed its purchase of the stock of Houston Pipe Line Company (HPL), an intrastate natural gas pipeline subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE).  The acquisition includes inventory and a 30-year pre-paid lease related to the operation of the Bammel Storage Facility.  The $726.6 million for the transaction will be raised by issuing a non-controlling, preferred equity interest to private investors.  

The purchase, announced Jan. 11, 2001, was completed following clearance from the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. HPL owns, or leases, and operates one of the most extensive and flexible natural gas gathering, transportation and storage operations in Texas. HPL's intrastate system includes more than 4,400 miles of pipe with capacity of approximately 2.4 billion cubic feet per day and the operation of the Bammel Storage Facility, one of the largest storage facilities in North America with a capacity of approximately 118 billion cubic feet and significant injection and withdrawal capacity.

Siebel launch is a great success
The EIM Fundamentals Siebel Team successfully launched The Force: Episode I (Siebel Express) in record time, less than 6 weeks. This was the quickest Siebel implementation thanks to teams in EIM, Networks, PWC (PriceWaterhouseCoopers) and Siebel Corp.The team took contact and account information from 100+ EIM originators and traders and compiled them into a single database for customer management. 

Training began on May 8, 2001.  In less than a month, we have populated The Force with 5,700 Accounts (Counterparties) and 10,000 Contacts for Forest Products and Steel Industries.  We have set up and trained over 150 users in 4 different domestic locations. Originators and traders now can easily log phone calls and meetings with customers as well as store deal documentation, deal pipeline and sales stage information.

Episode II will launch end of June and will include synchronization capabilities and well as other customized fields for EIM business. Siebel Sales Enterprise is a customer-focused centralized database, which enables sharing of all information learned about our customers.  Siebel is designed to help in-house and mobile sales professionals to manage accounts, contacts, activities and opportunities associated with the sales cycle.



IN THE NEWS

Enron Tops Gas Market: Higher commodity prices and greater demand have generated record earnings for many gas marketers during the past quarter, making energy one of the few sectors gaining ground in the U.S. economy. Leading the pack is Enron whose gas volumes grew 30 percent, with 27.2 billion cfd traded on average by March 31. Much of Enron's success is attributed to EnronOnline, which saw 275,000 transactions with a total value of $162 billion in various commodities in the first quarter. The second place earner, El Paso, earned half of Enron's total with only 13.8 billion traded in 2001.

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building."
2613,"Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you."
2614,"
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you."
2615,"It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.

Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.

Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999.

We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best."

I spoke to Ross Newlin regarding the vibration problems.  The Westinghouse 
engineers corrected the problem to the point that it was below alarm limits.  
There is no plan to repair the problem during the November outage since it 
requires significant run time and the economics are not there for a November 
run.  However, West. has committed to come back to the plant in January when 
we can schedule some run time.  Ross will try to track down the minutes of 
the outage planning meeting to document this.  I'll forward them to you when 
I get them.

do with a KVB Enertec purchase order.  I am not sure which one you are 
addressing.  I also sould direct you to Jim Meyer on this.  

We do receive from time to time copies of POs but typically we submit 
Purchase Requests and Jim issues the POs.  Depending on the service or item 
we may need to have a copy of the PO on site.  But typically we ask Jim for 
it when applicable.  He has copies of all POs and would just need to know 
which one you want.

2623,"Gentlemen,

Attached is a list of due diligence questions for the Enron generation
assets (Wheatland, Lincoln, Gleason and LV Cogen).  We would very much
appreciate your help is getting answers for by Friday, 10/20 if possible.

Unfortunately, we are still having significant difficulty in accessing
documents on DealBench.  The download time is usually several minutes to a
half hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully print
out on our systems.  Two of our consultants have experienced similar
difficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are not
unique to systems at PECO.

We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability to
bid on the assets.  Would it be possible to receive from you either a print
out of the documents or the documents on CD ROM?

Per my voice mail, I am with PECO Energy and am the PECO team lead on the
Enron opportunity.  CSFB (Lou Iaconetti) has informed us that PECO has been
selected to proceed into Round II of the bidding process on the Lincoln,
Gleason and Wheatland peaking units.  I would appreciate it if you could

2631,"David Parquet asked me to forward these answers to you:
Question:
Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Answer:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul."

Here is your spreadsheet. There are comments at the bottom each sheet. Many 
of them bring up the same points and I stopped making specific comments at 
the older projects. Sky River and VG comments are more detailed because we 
are the project partner again as of last week (these were divested for QF 
reasons in 1997).On the EnronSumm sheet added are some recommended further 
info to request and a summary of the main points in the comments. On the 
EnronVal sheet I suggest an alternative valuation for your consideration 
although issues on which I've made comments will still need resolution. Let 
me know what I can do for you further and when/if you'd like to go over this.

increase in forecast by the amount of the Acceleration for each project

revise the forecast for the ENA expenses for such items as Spare Parts and 
Interconnect Costs.

The report does reflect Nepco payments through June with an Estimate to 
Complete.  However the report does not show actuals by budget line item for 
the NEPCO reimbursables for May (Gleason and Wheatland) or June.   Mike 
Miller and I are currently working with EECC trying to resolve three issues, 
one of which are timely accurate reports. 


Dave,

I did receive an invoice from EECC for the $9 million fee for the 2000 
projects, which I think Mike forwarded to you.  Let me know if I need to 
include the fee, previously pulled out, in the forecast.

Thomas and or Mike may have already asked you this, but I want to make sure 
we're all on the same page (or determine if I'm not). In order to support the 
greenfield merchant decision making process for '01, we need price forecasts 
for the following locations / configurations:

1. Florida - 6 - LM6000s in simple cycle mode; 6 - LM 6000s plus a 74.9MW 
steam turbine in combined cycle mode
2. St. Charles Parrish, LA (south of N.O.) 6 - LM6000s in simple cycle mode
3. Chicago area: 2 - ABB 11N2s in simple cycle mode; 6 - LM 6000s in simple 
cycle mode
4. Ameren / AEC interface, Missouri - 6 - LM 6000s in simple cycle mode

Please let us know as to how we should proceed in order to obtain these 
forecasts as soon as possible. Perhaps Thomas can take the lead in dealing 
with the consultants after you make the intro...

"
2658,"I know the following goes without saying, but I wanted to highlight a few 
specific points relevant to this transaction.

As all of you know, the sale of Brownsville and Caledonia to Cinergy was 
recently announced.  As the press release indicated, the terms of the 
transaction were not released.  While Allegheny (with the sale of the 2000s) 
took the same position in its announcement, the purchase price was 
subsequently released to the market (by Allegheny).  Cinergy and Enron both 
agreed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, to not release the price and terms 
without the other's consent (i.e. THE PRICE AND TERMS WILL REMAIN 
CONFIDENTIAL). 

To the extent legally permitted, Cinergy will not release the price as part 
of its regulatory filings, and in fact, will redact the price from all of its 
filings.  If, through your involvement in this process, you inadvertently 
learned the price, you must keep it to yourself.  As we all know, information 
moves around this organization very quickly.  With two deals on very similar 
assets in the market at once (Allegheny and Cinergy), it only makes sense to 
contain the external flow of information.

By the way, both transactions should close March/April 2001.

Thanks for your help in this process, and your co-operation in keeping this 
information confidential.

Regards,

Don

2659,"Ben, 
Attached is the latest draft of the Beck report. I'm attaching a list that I 
prepared that generally has the items that are outstanding; however, the 
priority items are the back up information on performance testing (& curves) 
of the inlet fogging system and the peaking testing (output) of the three 
units and the confirmation of the data in table 5 (long term performance of 
the projects).
I have the O&M contracts, the monthly reports, and the contracts between OEC 
and Caldwell for the inlet fogging system, but these do not contain what 
Conrad (RW Beck) is looking for. My understanding from the operations guys is 
that there is data for the above items.
As discussed, Conrad will be here Monday morning, so if we could have the 
back up information for these items by then, it would expedite the process 
tremendously.
You can reach me at 54426 if you have any questions.
Thanks for your help.

2661,"Dear Members of the MC, BIC, OC, and TIE List,

Attached, please find the NYISO Weekly Update.  This
Update is written jointly by Elaine Robinson and other
NYISO staff.

The NYISO Weekly Update provides a brief status report of, or
progress on, a range of issues that are under discussion at
NYISO Committee meetings or are being undertaken by NYISO
Staff.  Many, but not all, of these issues are being addressed
through the NYISO Committee structure.

Market participants may raise any comments or questions on
items covered in the Update through the Committee structure,
"
2662,"The invoices for December 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by
23:00 today, Friday, September 28, 2001.  The NYISO apologizes for any
inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.

Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to:
(1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing
process;  (2)  adjust regulation penalty charges to zero for suppliers; and
(3)  adjust  the  NYISO  clearing account balance to zero for December 1999
settlements.

With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these
adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant
data fix.  As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments
is   done  outside  of  the  billing  process.   The  total  adjustment  of
$581,563.37  was  allocated  across 13,147,961 MWh.  Customers may validate
their  respective  adjustments  by  computing  their  ratio  shares  of the
$581,563.37  using  5,059,790  MWh  as  the denominator in their respective
ratios of their December 1999 load.  Customers will observe a difference in
the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment
versus  adjustment  #3.   This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for
adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the
adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.

Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the
revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of
forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred
by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.  In October
2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions
that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be
settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in
October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.  This results in
an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an
adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.   This  billing treatment for the
December  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market
totaling  $5,219,402.09  allocated  across 13,191,237 MWh.  Customers where
allocated their portion of adjustment #3 above, based upon their respective
ratio shares of the 13,191,237 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for
the month.

December  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to
address  the  delay  in  invoicing.  Payments due to the NYISO for December
1999  settlement  adjustments  are due to be received in the NYISO clearing
account  on  Monday, October 15, 2001.  Payments due to market participants
will  be  made on Friday, October 19, 2001.  Please refer to the attachment
below for banking instructions.

Dear Market Participant,

In the interest of not flooding the webmaster with constant changes (new
PTIDs or new participant names) to the
UCAP forms (Certification, Bid Forms, and Offer Forms), I will be updating
the forms about once per month.  Since you will
need a methodology to work around missing information, the new forms have
codes that will allow you to enter
undefined PTIDs and undefined new participants.

PTID number 999999 is used for a resource that has not been assigned a
number.
NewLSE is used for a new Load Serving Entity that has not been assigned a
""Registrant Name""
NewSuppl is used for a new Supplier that has not been assigned a
""Registrant Name""

NOTE that if you use any of the above, you must describe your intentions in
the comments cell of the form being submitted.

Other Changes

ISOSu is the prefix for sales or purchases that occurred as a result of
NYISO transactions during the supplemental
process.  The supplemental process is implemented when there is
insufficient UCAP available within a location and
the NYISO must purchase UCAP from outside the location where the shortage
has occurred to meet the NYCA reliability requirements.

PTID numbers to be used when identifying UCAP purchased through the NYISO
auction have been assigned.  The PTID
numbers range from 1 to 38 and are related to auctions or the supplemental
processes.   For example, a participant who is
selling UCAP that was previously purchased in the summer strip auction
would enter PTID number 1 on the Offer form when
selling into a subsequent ISO auction.

A list of PTID numbers is now available on the instruction page of the
auction Offer forms.



Reminder

When identifying an ISO auction, please remember that you must think in
terms of the procurement period for the first auction
month when the transaction took place.  For example, on May 15 (the auction
for the upcoming months of June through October)
3MW were transacted for the months of June and August.  The auction
reference that you will use for both the June and
August transactions are ISOMoJun.  The same auction reference would be used
if on May 15, the transactions were for
August and September.

When completing the Certification Form, do not net transactions.  Lets say
that you are awarded 25 MW from the Strip
Auction and later move (purchase or sell) 5 MW through a bilateral.  Your
entries on the form would show the 25 MW strip
auction transaction on one line and your second line would show the 5 MW
bilateral transaction.  You can not use a
value of 20MW on one line.

Each and Every Month you must submit your certification form.



Regards,
Bob Boyle

2674,"Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

2718,"Attached is a spreadsheet that lists all the new generation projects that need artcicle X permitting for New York.  The newest generation coming online is Coneds 360 MW East River Repowering slated for Q4 2002.  However, after speaking to Coned this morning this plan seems a little ambitous and won't probably come online until 2003.  Construction on this project has not yet begun and will be GE Frame7s.  The only substantial MWs under construction is PG&E's Athens plant which is 1080 MWs in Zone F slated for Q3 2003.  Everything else posted is still in planning stages.  However, these numbers do not show any generation under 80 MW that don't require an article X permitting process.  The estimated amount of potential new supply for NYC is 380MW and 204MW for Long Island that could come online that don't require permitting.  

Overall supply recap,  no new sizeable generation slated probably until end of 2003 or early 2004.  Last summer on Aug9 the NYISO peaked at 31,050 MW and Coned peaked at 12,134 MW.  The NYISO predicts that given an extreme weather case the max demand  can goto 32,290 MW.  I will keep everybody updated on any new supply changes.  You can access this website  http://www.dps.state.ny.us/articlex.htm  whichs shows the new generation projects in NY.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources."

You are invited to attend the 3rd Annual Urban Business Initiative Volunteer
Kickoff on Wednesday, September 26, 2001 at Slainte Irish Pub (509 Main
Street) at 6:00 p.m.

The Urban Business Initiative is a group of young professional volunteers
who are committed to the economic revitalization of Houston's inner city.
UBI was founded by a group of Enron analysts in 1996, and has since grown to
include volunteers from more than 15 corporations in Houston.

UBI volunteers work on consulting teams with small business owners and
entrepreneurs in Houston's inner city on projects such as developing
business and marketing plans, conducting financial analyses, and providing
technology assessments.  They also develop and conduct business education
seminars to promote business literacy in Houston.

Please join us if you would like to learn more about the Urban Business
Initiative and the impact we are having on Houston's inner-city businesses.

Sincerely,
Mary Messick

2785,"Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

Attached are suggested changes to the Long Description to more closely align 
the Into product in the EEI with the EOL Into product.
 
The Force Majeure relief for this particular product has been clarified to 
ensure that Force Majeure relief is not available in the event that non-firm 
transmission is scheduled. 
 
If we add the EEI definition of Force Majeure, the applicability or otherwise 
to certain products would need to be set out in the Long Description. At this 
stage, since we are focusing on the Into product, I would propose that the 
GTCs remain the same, until we make the more widesweeping change to bring EOL 
in line with EEI.
 
When you are back lets meet to discuss how  best to take this forward.
 
As to the broader change to reflect the EEI, we will need to consider how to 
deal with the issues on the Cover Sheet. The credit terms are probably not 
something that we can achieve ""click"" approvals of just yet, however the 
changes we would like to see to the EEI could obviously be included as part 
of the ""click"" and accept concept on EOL.  I will be giving this further 
thought and will make some recommendations when I have had the opportunity to 
go through the documents and the issues which will need to be addressed.

 As a preliminary point, is it your understanding that, provided we display 
the  attribution to the copyright owners on the Website, we will not need to 
obtain any further licenses? This is not clear on the face of the document 
which does not envisage that the document will be displayed as part of a 
website's terms and conditions, capable of acceptance. Is there a licence I 
could have a look at, for example? I am concerned that the digital rights may 
still be retained by the copyright owners, however having regard to the 
tremendous exposure and endorsement the document would receive by being used 
on EOL, I would hope that any licenses, if required, could be concluded 
quickly and at no cost to EOL.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus

"
2820,"Jeanne,

Looks great.  I don't have any changes.

I like your characterization of the ""bond cap"" issue Pat and I mentioned this 
morning.  My bet is that, ultimately, this will drive the CPUC to increase 
the CPA.  Once the legislators figure out that the general fund will not be 
fully reimbursed if the bond issue is less than $10 billion, they will put 
pressure on the CPUC to make sure the CPA is as large as possible.

Here is a rough draft.  I will also start on TVA letter.  Per my earlier vm, 
I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.  I'm not sure if 
we get any ""cap"" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't 
accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover 
entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the 
past.  According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may 
not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period.  I will try to talk to him 
tonight.). If  TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the 
termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case 
our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.  Let me know what 
you think.  I'll be in early tomorrow.  Thanks"

revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was discussed on=20

(1) As you and I discussed last week,  I thought it made sense to specify a=
=20
reasonable date by which Enron and PG&E shall have reached closure on a=20
settlement agreement on the contract termination and related claims.  I =20
proposed a one month period to do that.  If the parties can=01,t come to an=

agreement in that time period, then the =01&mechanics=018 in the MPA for re=
solving=20
a dispute dealing with the calculation of the termination payment would be=
=20
=01&reactivated.=018  Obviously, if we are making progress, the parties can=
 always=20
extend the date.  I felt it was appropriate to specify the window period to=
=20
make sure that everyone is focused on attempting to get a prompt resolution=
. =20
Assuming a final settlement agreement is agreed upon, the conditions of the=
=20
extension of the =01&stay=018 would be embodied in the settlement agreement=
 itself =20
(as opposed to this letter).

(2) Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in place while t=

parties were working to see if a settlement agreement could be reached, and=
=20
that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the letter.  Thus, the=20
revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the =01&Initial Extensi=

ld be=20
required to keep the LCs in place even if no settlement agreement were to b=
e=20
reached.  My view is that any requirement to maintain the LCs beyond the=20
Initial Extension Period and any conditions with respect thereto, if agreed=
=20
to by Enron, should be part of the final settlement agreement executed by t=

parties, rather than as part of this letter.  Also, we note that, as a=20

From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of ""the lack of mutuality"" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.

California Power Exchange May Lose Monopoly on Federal Ruling
11/4/0 11:56 (New York)

California Power Exchange May Lose Monopoly on Federal Ruling

     Pasadena, California, Nov. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The California
Power Exchange, the marketplace where the state's three investor-
owned utilities must buy electricity, is on the brink of losing
its monopoly following this summer's power-price surge.
     The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission this week proposed
eliminating a state rule that PG&E Corp., Edison International and
Sempra Energy purchase almost all their power through the
exchange, which cost California consumers more than $100 million
to create. FERC expects to issue a final order by year-end.
     Under the proposal, the utilities could buy electricity
through other exchanges or directly from providers such as Enron
Corp. and Dynegy Inc. FERC said the move would help fix
California's ``seriously flawed'' market, where supply shortages
forced utilities to cut power to some customers this summer.
     ``The role of the power exchange is going to shrink,'' said
Josh Rokach, an adviser to FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert. ``People
will rely more on bilateral contracts'' between utilities and
generators, he said.
     Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform
Network, a San Francisco-based consumer group, went further:
``It's quite possible that the exchange will wither away if we
follow everything FERC has ordered.''

                         Expansion

     Others aren't so sure. Though intended to serve only
California, the exchange now handles one-fourth of the power
delivered in the Western Systems Coordinating Council, whose
members supply 14 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts
of Mexico.
     Further expansion into areas such as Nevada, Arizona and
Alberta, Canada, will offer local electricity buyers and sellers
``a well-developed market operator ready for competition,''
exchange President George Sladoje said in a statement.
     California lawmakers established the nonprofit exchange in
1996, as part of the deregulation of the state's electricity
market.
     The utilities buy 80 percent to 90 percent of their
electricity on the exchange, based in Pasadena, California. The
three utilities together supply about 75 percent of the state's
power, with the rest coming from cooperatives and municipal
agencies.

                         Long-Term Contracts

     The exchange is a day-ahead market, where buyers and sellers
set prices for power to be delivered the next day. The California
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's grid,
sells electricity in the hourly market, which fills last-minute
needs.
     FERC wants to give the utilities the opportunity to lock in
prices for power through longer-term contracts known as forwards.
Arranging supplies in advance would reduce the amount of power
that utilities must buy during periods of peak consumption, when
prices can soar, FERC says.
     Though the exchange has operated a forwards market since July
1999, the utilities until recently were prohibited from using it.
Even now, they must receive approval from the California Public
Utilities Commission to enter such contracts, and the amount of
electricity they can buy is limited.
     By comparison, municipal utilities such as the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power can freely enter into long-term
contracts and don't pay the transaction fees charged by the
exchange.
     Even if PG&E, Edison and Sempra are allowed to obtain
supplies through alternative means, the exchange isn't likely to
go away, said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of Sacramento-
based Independent Energy Producers, a trade group that represents
about 50 power producers.
     ``There will continue to be a need for a place for people to
do day-ahead transactions,'' Smutny-Jones said.

                         Transparency

     The exchange's ability to compete would depend in part on
whether rivals such as Enron and Dynegy, which sell electricity
throughout the U.S., are required to list prices openly, exchange
spokesman Jesus Arredondo said.
     ``Those folks don't have transparency right now,'' he said.
``If there isn't a level playing field, we're going to be at a
disadvantage.''
     Yet transparency on the exchange hasn't kept prices low.
During this year's hottest months, as demand for air conditioning
soared, the prices utilities paid for electricity through the
exchange and the California ISO more than quadrupled from a year
earlier.
     Utilities weren't able to respond to the price jump by
cutting their purchases because they needed the power, noted Bob
Levin, senior vice president of planning at the New York
Mercantile Exchange, one of the exchanges hoping to attract
business from California's utilities.
     ``FERC's proposal is a good way to start improving the
market,'' Levin said.
     Not everyone thinks allowing companies to buy outside the
exchange is without risk. State Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat
from El Cajon who co-wrote the state's 1996 deregulation law,
worries that oil and gas companies, big users of electricity for
their refineries, might draw up supply agreements in secret and
keep consumers in the dark about the terms.

                        Monopoly's End

     He warned in an Oct. 3 letter to FERC Chairman James Hoecker
that eliminating the exchange in favor of bilateral contracts
``would be disastrous, particularly for small commercial and
residential consumers.''
     Keeping California power prices a secret would be difficult,
even without the exchange, some industry observers say.
     Publishing companies such as Platt's, the commodities
division of Standard & Poor's, Financial Times Energy, and
Bloomberg LP report energy prices from around the world.
     They would be expected to begin collecting more information
in California as well if the market requires it, said Mark Palmer,
vice president of communications for Houston-based Enron Corp.,
the world's largest trader of electricity.
     ``You'll probably see California price indexes,'' Palmer
said.
     Spokesmen for Rosemead, California-based Edison and San Diego-
based Sempra said their companies wouldn't comment on future of
the exchange or their power purchases until FERC issues a final
order. PG&E, based in San Francisco, is reviewing the agency's
report, a spokesman said.
     Whatever FERC's decision, the exchange's future ultimately
should be decided by the market, not the state, said Richard
Bilas, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission.
     ``If the exchange is operating efficiently, it will survive
on its own,'' he said. ``Not as a sanctioned monopoly.''

Dear Doug,

I decided to wait until after Christmas to respond to your letter.

I have drafted an amended petition which adds Randy, Steve, and Enron as
defendants.  Among other matters, the petition includes tort claims arising
from acts of slander, fraud, and tortious interference with contract.

You have been critical of my decision to file the original petition in
September because, as I understand it, you believed that I had failed to
exhaust other avenues for redress.  I believe that every other potential
means of resolution had been exhausted.  However, in respect for your offer
of constructive criticism, I would like to once again extend an offer for
mediation in an attempt to resolve the ECOGAS matter, and now these matters.

I called your office and understand that you are not in today.  As I
anticipate that you may be on vacation this week, I will wait until next
week before proceeding with any new filings.

Please contact me if mediation is of any interest to your client.  If it
won't be you, please let me know if you happen to know who will be
representing the additional defendants.

Best regards,
Tom

From the comments I've heard no one is trying to make you the scape goat.  If 
your feeling victimized by someone, give me a call and lets talk about it.  
There was a breakdown in communication between the deal team, trading and 
accounting on this issue.  Its not a good thing that it happened, and now we 
have to deal with it. 

The bottom line is that the PRM unwind cost is $203 cost plus the 5.5 bcf 
re-injection cost (based on the fact that we have been representing 65.5 bcf 
of pad gas since we began the process).   As you mention in your note, your 
use of 5.5 bcf of pad gas over the past years is independent of the balance 
sheet, and has been a great way to optimize the Bammel asset. 

Since we didn't adjust the pad gas volume we represented on the balance 
sheet, we are obligated to deliver 65.5 bcf and therefore must include a 5.5 
bcf re-injection assumption as part of the unwind cost.   What we need to do 
know is decide the best way to hedge this obligation, given the forward price 
curve and the uncertainty as to when Closing will occur.

Regards,
Brian

2931,"
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

The ball game last night was a disaster!
We give the ""Bad News Bears"" a bad name.
Example:  Runners on 1st and 2nd. I ask the third baseman what he will do if the ball comes to him.  He replies touch third base.  So the batter hits the ball down the third base line he runs up 5-10 feet from the third base picks up the ball and throws it to the pitcher.  I give up!  We lost 20 to 3

On a worse note.  Please don't say anything to anybody but Pat just called and said Shannon has filled for divorce.
I hate to say this but he has created his own worse nightmare.  She has never earned a penny of the money she has become accustomed too, yet feels it should belong to her.  He has done nothing but foster this attitude.  Too bad its not legal to spank your spouse.

2937,"avid (avid) adjective

   1. Having an ardent desire or unbounded craving; greedy.

   2. Marked by keen interest and enthusiasm.

[Latin avidus, from avere, to desire.]

   ""Global Exchange, for instance, is an outfit of 40 people based in San
   Francisco, and an avid believer in street protest.""
   Angry and effective, Economist, Sep 23, 2000.

A popular motivational saying goes, ""Desserts is stressed spelled backwards.""
This is an example of a reversible word, which when read from the right
yields another word. All of this week's words exhibit this quality. Just like
reversible clothing that changes pattern when worn inside out, reversible
words result in other usable words. A special case of reversible words are
palindromes, which spell the same when reversed. So palindromes are a subset
of reversible words which in turn are a subset of anagrams. Another name for
reversible words is semordnilap, a self-referential word coined by reversing
the word palindromes.

Some words coined in this manner have actually entered the dictionary. Here
are two examples: YOB (a rowdy youth), coined by reversing BOY, and MHO
(former unit of conductance), coined by reversing OHM, the unit of electrical
resistance.

Taking inspiration from the above desserts/stressed saying, can you coin a
pithy aphorism using some word and its semordnilap? Don your wordsmith hats

2944,"John Buchanan and I discussed TW's transfer of gas from the PG&E/Topock 
receipt/delivery point to the PG&E/Topock Park N' Ride point to implement 
TW's use of PG&E's Market Center service.  My understanding is that 
physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will 
simply be a paper transfer.  Since a contract is required in our system as a 
formality to implement the transfer, the rate TW will ""charge"" itself for the 
transfer is $0.  

This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with 
the above scenario.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call 
me (x30596).
"
2945,"Lorraine -- answers to some of your questions.

Questar Line 90 Company purchased the facilities from ARCO for a total of $38 
million.  At the time it made its FERC application, Questar Southern Trails' 
estimated cost of 1) purchasing the facilities from Line 90 Company and 2) 
converting the line to gas service via the construction of compressor 
stations and various pipeline replacements, realignments and extension:  155 
million.  I assume you want more detail so I'll have Mike Vannorden get the 
relevant exhibits.  

Southern Trails proposed to install 7 new compressor stations.  These are 
detailed on Table 1 in their application cover letter (on my desk if you want 
to take a look).  The various pipeline modifications they proposed to make 
are described in some detail on pages 12 - 16.

Available capacity:  120,000 Dth/day in West Zone; 87,500 in East Zone.

I will have Mike send you exhibits I believe might be of interest."
2946,"will do! All lists are currently under construction. Will you forward your
list as well?

I decided to wait until Thanksgiving to give you G's portrait - is that okay
with you? I CAN send it sooner if you prefer. Her school pics are in now
too.

Sorry I didn't call back last night. We were toy shopping with Grandma Sally
and then it was time for dinner, etc., etc. and got a call from Mema where
she immediately launched into all of her health problems.  Was Dreamy Eric
to your liking?

Why don't we choose a venue somewhere between Duke and downtown.

2956,"Greetings  Susan

I need to work on releasing our NGPL capacity - do you have a  contact there and do you have access to their bulletin board?"
2957,"I think your plan sounds fine.  I'm not sure there is
too much he can do to talk his way completely out of
it.  I just don't like the fact that he has been such
a weirdo lately.  It sounds like he just may have a
flaw of some type.  I guess if he had a serious
girlfriend come back into his life or something, maybe
that would explaing things.  Otherwise, if he was
goint through some type of other trauma, you would
think he would share it with you.  I can't wait to
find out how it goes.  Molina's sounds great, what a
place to make a tense situation more relaxed.  The
phone call is a must, I wouldn't answer any more e
mails from him (ever!).

About Korea...I'm glad you are still coming over.  It
will be fine that you are coming with your parents.
We'll just drag them along with whatever we want to
do.  I don't recall them ever slowing us down before!

Have fun in London.  Do you have any Enron interviews
scheduled?  I'm sure you and Emily are going to have a
lot of fun.  I hope you like the London office.  I
guess you may have heard our latest.  We filed all of
the paperwork electronically for our follow-on
assignment after Korea.  We ranked Germany, Hawaii,
Savannah, Ft. Bragg (NC) and Ft. Campbell (KY) in that
order.  The guys e mailed us back and said he wouldn't
be able to get us Europe or Hawaii and that Savannah
is ""overstrength"" and that he would probably need us
at Campbell.  Needless to say, we are both furious
about getting our last choice.  Not necessarily with
the base, but with our lack of selection.  Ft.
Campbell wouldn't have even been in our list if it
wasn't the only place left where Chinooks go.  It
really ticks me off that hard work just doesn't pay
off in the Army.  We didn't get an option coming out
of Korea, we got an assignment.  What's the incentive
to do your job well, and most importantly, what is the
incentive to stay in.  I'm so mad that we don't have
any say in our next assignment and that Chuck could
likely get Korea again after that.  Gotta love the
Army.

It's not a done deal, I've got to get Chuck fired up a
little to fight this whole thing.  The guy said he'd
get back to us in a few weeks and let us know for
sure.  I hope we can beat him with a response and at
least try and negotiate with him.  We may even extend
6 months in Korea if it will make a difference.

Ft. Campbell is an hour outside of Nashville, TN.  I
think there are nice areas to live in closer to
Nashville.  Maybe we could live halfway in between and
I could work in Nashville and Chuck could commute a
little to work.  I just hate the idea of living in
another small town for another 2-3 years.  Enterprise
was enough.  We'll keep you posted.  Maybe it will
work out for the best anyway.  Maybe this is how Chuck
is going to get his big fixed wing break.

Let me know how the whole Ted thing goes, and we'll
start planning for your visit.

Chris

2959,"Hi Girls!
It's that time again.  We need to get everyone together for our annual
Christmas Dinner.  I have spoken to many of you and tried to come up
with a good time for everyone.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be
a ""perfect day"", but how about Friday-Dec. 22nd?  Please respond and
tell me what you think.  I have had a few suggestions for a
place-Churrasco's, America's, Ruggles, Benji's, Sullivans-please send a
suggestion.  Don't say it doesn't matter because majority vote will win
and there will be no recount.  The time will probably be around 8 p.m.
I know the 22nd is close to Christmas, so the 19th has also been
suggested-but I am afraid not everyone will be in town yet.  Please send
me your thoughts on the day, restauraunt, and if we should plan
something after dinner.  I can't wait to see everyone and hope all can
make it!

"
2961,"From astrology.com (must I beware of overindulgence in such websites?)
I like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very true.

Sagittarius and Sagittarius
When two Sagittarians join together in a love match, the truth-loving natures 
makes theirs a near perfect relationship. This couple views the world around 
them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more 
knowledge. They will engage one another in pleasant conversation and 
banter that challenges and tickles the mind.  An occasional hotheaded dispute 
can erupt in the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship, when one fact-fanatic 
Sag 
partner carries things a little too far. Easygoing and independent, these two 
are 
compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests. They've never known 
jealousy, and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with 
their 
lover. When they are together, however, they do all they can toward pleasing 
their partner and satiating common interests.  Although they are adaptable 
and 
modern, they can, at times, fly off the handle. However, it is not in the 
Archer's 
nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long. 

Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter (Luck). Expansion is the key word 
here; 
as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge, they will carry over 
exciting 
ideas into their relationship. They must be mindful of over-indulgences, as 
such 
gluttony will only distract them. Their charm and charisma make them a very 
pleasant couple not only to one another, but the entire crowd. "
2962,"Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we ""share"" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

2969,"Lad,

In keeping with Section 1.1.3.10 of the settlement regarding direct connect
the following changes need to be made.

PG7 Line 12 needs to be changed from ""Delivery points are defined as the
local transmission system, storage, receipt point pools, and the city gate
pool."" to ""Delivery points include the local transmission system, storage,
receipt point pools, and the city gate pool.""

PG7 Line 20 ""Local Transmission user facilities are not to access and
deliver gas supplies from receipt points."" needs to be eliminated.

Parties agreed to put this battle off until later.  Testimony should not
give any preference to one side or the other.  These changes move the
arguments to the center.

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.  "
2974,"We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.

Susan, 
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.  That part is fine.  However, if you leave on the following Sunday, you'll be back into Houston Sunday.  Here is the tenative itenerary: 
Looks like Continental leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental to LAX 0940-1105. 
Korean Air from LA to Korea at 1230.  You would arrive on Wed evening (the 15th) at 5:05pm. 
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Korea at 5:30 pm on the 26th and arriving to LA at 
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Continental at 3:30 and arriving in Houston at 9:00pm 
Sunday night. 
Let me know how that sounds.

2987,"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan"

"
2996,"I do not know anything about a Waiver of Conflicts for this specific 
Counterpart (from Lotus Notes- it appears that Sara worked on the file) but I 
have cleared conflicts when working with Kevin Leitao and others in the past. 
I used to run potential conflicts past Mark T. but this procedure seems to 
have changed, at least with respect to Houston based firms. 

Last week I had 2 instances where a Bracewell atty was asked to represent our 
CP in connection with negotiating a swap agreement. One Bracewell atty was 
from the NY office; the other from their Chicago office. After speaking to 
Mark T. who spoke to Mark H., the proper thing to do is to ask Jim Derrick to 
clear the conflict, especially when the law firm is Houston based. 

Jim D. cleared the conflict in both cases subject to the following 
conditions: 

1. The waiver should be narrowly drawn for this specific matter ONLY. 
2. The Atty/Firm will not act for CP in any proceedings adverse to Enron.
3. The Atty/Firm will not act in any litigation on behalf of CP against Enron.

With regard to a Waiver letter, Jim D. said that if the transaction/agreement 
concerns ENA - then Mark H. should sign it. If it concerns Enron Corp., Jim 
D., Rob Walls or Rex Rogers could sign it. 

Hope this is helpful,

We need to have someone check into the legal issues associated with our 
trading equities in each of the respective countries we are interested in 
trading.  We need to get rulings on shares, futures and options for both 
exchange traded and over the counter activity for each country.  This 
""research"" should be performed in much the same way as when we began trading 
in Australia.  Some of the countries involved may have already been ""green 
lighted"" a few years ago.  The countries we need to look into initially are:

Germany
France
Italy
Norway
Netherlands
Spain
United Kingdom


Once we get feedback on these countries we should continue on to secondary 
countries which include:

Austria
Belgium
Denmark
Ireland
Israel
Sweden
Switzerland
Portugal
Turkey


I will leave up to yourselves to decide where this project should be 
coordinated from but as we are a US coporate and ECT Investments, the 
principal booking entity, is a US entity I would imagine it should be handled 
from the States.  Please let me know if anyone has any questions or would 
like to discuss issues associated with this request. 

Thanks and regards,
John


"
3008,"To follow up on Scott's message below.  The attached proposal sheet has the 
entity information for the Raptor II structure.  The proposal sheet should 
contain the information that is necessary to support the confirm.  The asset 
description should describe the business or entity.  A specific description 
of the underlying investment and interest in should also be included.  Under 
the detail of the derivative include the type (at the money price return 
swap, put, call...), term, legal name, specific investment type (type of 
stock, warrant ...), initial price, initial shares, initial notional value.  
The valuation support should be attached with the proposal sheet.  For this 
transaction, there is no premium calculation since the swap is at the money.



Please provide this information to Sara and me.  I will distribute the 
information to Ryan and Scott.  After the confirm is completed, I will submit 
the information to the counterparty for approval.

Please call me if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Gordon

3009,"I  think you ought to do a bit of hand holding to help Randy complete this. 
For example, we know the type of derivative, the specific investment type and 
a lot of the other information called for by the form. I really think you'll 
spend less time working on this if you sit down with Randy and help him 
prepare the form. Also, Randy needs some guidance on what sort of description 
of the underlying investment is appropriate. I'm sure Randy can attach 
something in his file that works just fine (as opposed to preparing something 
for this). Also, you and Randy need to discuss how the fairness opinion is 
used and whether it's provided to LJM to help support the swap price. Thanks!

3022,"Just got your voice mail.  I have severe laryngitis and I cannot use my voice 
today or tomorrow.  Sorry.  We can e-mail or speak through Marie.  
Yes, we have a blackline.  Marie has finished going through it and I need to 
review (the lawyers blacklined the latest version over the second blackline 
so we had to revert to a comparision to the first blackline!).  Re: the 
credit support annex, I believe all is resolved.  However, I believe there is 
still an L/C issue.  If there is an L/C default (say the issuer is 
downgraded), Tiger is insisting that we post cash immediately without the 
right to post a  substitute L/C within two days.  I am not absolutely certain 
of this, but Carol has a 2 pm call with the lawyers and I will listen.  I 
don't know if Tiger responded to our guaranty.  I was out sick yesterday.  
Hope this brings you up to date.  SS  "

3026,"Bob and Sara,

I think the additional questions that need to be addressed are as follows.  
Once we have your input on these issues, 
our only remaining legal issues will revolve around (1) setting up NY 
brokerage, (2) actually setting up the different 
legal entities and related service agreements, (3) EOL product descriptions 
and (4) revisions to template ISDA agreements.

Outstanding Issues:
1.  Are personnel involved in a regulated brokerage business able to market 
OTC derivative products to clients without
     regulatory conflict?  (Both US and UK)
2.  Are there any special consideration s in terms of corporate organization 
or operations that we must use in order not to 
     create conflict stemming from our OTC business as a regulated exchange 
member (both UK and US)?
3.  To avoid regulatory burdens on other aspects of Enron and the Softs 
business, in what corporate entity will the NY
      clearing business reside?
4.  For those counterparties looking to transact with ENA as principal, can 
we (1) provide parent guarantees for selected
     counterparties or (2) can we use ENA to take a trade via a back-to-back 
with ENA Softs, for example?
5.  In regards to service agreements, is there a threshold of activity that 
establishes a tax or regulatory presence over and
     above any service agreement (ie- compromises the organizational 
structure)?
6.  How would a Chinese Wall be structured between the brokerage and OTC 
businessses?  General market information
      will likely need to be shared and some sharing between client and 
non-EOL broker will occur.  Please lay out the 
      concept and structure behind this mechanism so that we can better 
understand this.

Please add comments as this is a checklist and likely not comprehensive.

Regards,
Darren

3029,"Peter,

I do not show that this counterparty has an executed ISDA, which would make 
me hesitant with respect to No. 6 below.  I think we should pursue an ISDA if 
they want to do this going forward.

3036,"Hi Sara,

I have completed a preliminary legal review of the Account Agreements with 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  

I read the draft language you sent re: limitation of liability that you 
suggested we add to these and the Bear Stearns agreements for Enron Credit, 
Inc.   Because these agreements have arbitration clauses, this provision as 
drafted might be unenforceable under the NASD rules.  I am going to 
doublecheck the law on this point today or over the weekend.  If this is in 
fact correct, the firms will probably reject the provision on this ground 
especailly if including it would subject them to NASD fines.   In any case, 
we can wait to see what there response is but in the meantime we should set 
aside time to discuss the law on this point.

I thought it might be helpful to be very basic about withholding issues,

a party that would help us select an appropriate tax module.  We tend to not 
""think"" and expect a party ""fill in the blank"" when we are preparing draft

racement of the 115.75-135.15 move provided a solid base for a corrective r=

the 50% retracement of the same move. More importantly, the yen is approach=
ing its 200-day moving average of 125 for the first time since November.  M=
eanwhile, the government's resolve to boost Japanese assets ahead of March =
31 is likely to fend off any negative news that comes its way. Case in poin=
t was today's 2% rise in the Nikkei despite Japan's Q4 GDP which fell 1.2% =
q/q and was the first time in nearly a decade that output had fallen three =
quarters in a row. The figure attracted little attention and instead, talk =
of a global recovery has sparked a wave of foreign money coming into Japan =
as large American banks have announced their repositioning in favor of Japa=
nese shares.  Japanese banks are pinning their hopes on the stock market ho=
lding onto recent gains, at least until the end of the fiscal year end on M=
arch 31, when they book their massive stockholdings at market value. If pla=
yers can hold the Nikkei at 12,000, banks could slash latent stock losses b=
y trillions of yen, help improve their capital adequacy ratios and keep the=
m  solvent.    However, this would still not solve their fundamental proble=
ms. Therefore, there still remains doubt as to whether the Nikkei can maint=
ain its recent gains after the March 31 fiscal year end and whether the spe=
ctacular rise in yen on speculative trading will come undone over the next =
few weeks. BoJ Governor Hayami alluded to this today when he said he expect=
ed the market to be stable through the end of March, but did not say what c=
ould happen afterwards.  USD/JPY fell nearly 5% this week alone, while EUR/=
JPY fell only 3%. This gap has been filled by the 2 cent rise in EUR/USD an=
d supports the notion that rise in the yen is strictly a Japan-driven play =
rather than a global growth-driven play. The enforcement of anti-short-sell=
ing laws in Japan and the rebound in the Nikkei enhances the yen repatriati=
on play.  EUR/USD fell to a day's low of 87.80 as it retreated from an over=
night high of 88.40. On Thursday, the market ignored the European Central B=
ank's decision to keep rates steady at 3.25%. Markets had anticipated the c=
entral bank would take no action due to growing signs of Eurozone economic =
recovery and rising inflationary pressures. But despite the recent rise in =
EUR/USD, the dollar's weakness is primarily contained to the yen. Neverthel=
ess, the euro is still threatening to take out 88.10 cents, which is the 50=
% retracement of this year's move 90.63 to 85.63. From there, the euro face=
s its next resistance at 88.50. Support is viewed at 87.0, backed by 86.65 =

Rather that calling the SEC, a easier and a cost effective approach may be to prepare the March 31, 2002 SEC 13F filing which is due on May 15, 2002 now.

I have confirmed with Art Boos, Bowne, 713-869-9181, that we can submit and approve now and they will hold unitl the release date in May.  

Please advise if you are okay with this approach.  At Sara's suggestion, I have discussed with Robert George who agrees with the the efficacy of this approach.

Hope things are well with you.  Classes started here this week and I'm
still getting my schedule straigtened out.  Fortunately, I got into the
Speculative Markets course.  However, I still need to choose a second

I have until friday at 3 PM EST to choose between FIXED INCOME (dealing
primarily with bond replication, fairly quantitative) and FUNDING
INVESTMENTS (a broad examination of how firms finance investment with
corporate securities).

Which of the two do you think would help me out the most at Enron Global

I attach a note I wrote for the head of Continental Trading that lays out the 
work that I -  
with support from the origination and regulatory collegeauges- have been 
engaged in. It is reasonably current. 
The examples of transaction support that have resulted in $$, are from the 
second half of 2000. The first six months
of this year have been focussed on advocacy work related to the revision of 
the German energy
law, negotiating a network agreement for gas, supporting EU investigations in 
abusive practices
and building up stronger political relationships through our trade 
association - EFET. 

The deal support efforts from this year thus far relate to:

Significant support provided to the German origination team to secure 
transport across Germany,
Switzerland, and Italy to provide gas to our first Italian customers. My work 
was focussed on 
getting the Swiss gas company to the negotiating table (something they were 
very reluctant to do) through
regulatory/legal pressures. Currently doing the same to secure TPA  to the 
Trans Austria gas pipeline and
the Baltic Cable - again employing our now well-established regulatory and 
legal pressures (bad cop tactics)
Gas pipeline access in Austria will allow us to significantly increase volume 
supplied to our Italian customers
Baltic access will allow us to begin actively arbitraging power price 
differentials between Germany and
Nordpool. Each of these will be firsts for newcomers in the European market. 

I hope this helps, Paul

By Jason Leopold 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to 
order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis 
claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 
2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. 

Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from 
the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC 
lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent 
System Operator.  
   
That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could 
potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. 

Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in 
unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC 
administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will 
likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis 
expects. 

Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., ""with one goal, 
and that is to bring back $9 billion."" 

Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO 
documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. 

David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general 
manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but 
conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. 

Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork 
for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from 
corporate energy suppliers. 

But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press 
secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about 
getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated 
by FERC. 

Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators 
overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. 

State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation 
into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on ""shaky 
calculations."" 

To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices 
received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been 
expected under competitive market conditions. 

The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at 
times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices 
in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with 
air-quality rules. 

The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern 
border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the 
fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. 

The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's ""Big Five"" power 
suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the 
conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. 

The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest 
utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid 
operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the 
documents. 

The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed 
amounts between May 2000 and February:

Market-Based Rates for Ancillary Services

 Pursuant to Order No. 888, companies with general market-based rate
authority must separately obtain market-based rate authority for ancillary
services.  See Order No. 888 at 31,720 quoting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) as stating: ""The fact that we have authorized a utility to
sell wholesale power at market-based rates does not mean we have authorized
the utility to sell ancillary services at market-based rates.""  Accordingly,
an entity with market-based rate authority must make a separate showing with
regard to securing market-based rates for ancillary services.

 In markets that are currently administered by independent system
operators (""ISOs"") - i.e., the PJM Interconnection, LLC (""PJM""), the New
York ISO (""NYISO""), ISO-New England (""ISO-NE""), and the California ISO
(""Cal-ISO"") - the FERC has previously permitted entities with general
market-based rate authority to sell ancillary services in those markets to
the extent that it has authorized other suppliers to sell such ancillary
services.  See Canadian Niagara Power Co., Ltd., 87 FERC ? 61,070 (1999)
(authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into the
NYISO and ISO-NE markets); Minergy Neenah, L.L.C., et al., 88 FERC ? 61,102
(1999) (authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into
the NYISO); Atlantic City Elec. Co., et al., 86 FERC ? 61,039 (1999)
(authorizing sales of ancillary services at market-based rates into PJM);
PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., 91 FERC ? 61,021 (2000) (same); see also New
England Power Pool, 85 FERC ? 61,379 (1998); Central Hudson Gas & Elec.
Corp., et al., 86 FERC ? 61,062 (1999); Connectiv Energy Supply Inc., 91
FERC ? 61,076 (2000); AES Redondo Beach, L.L.C., et al., 83 FERC ? 61,358,
order on reh'g and clarification, 85 FERC ? 61,123 (1998), order on reh'g
and clarification, 87 FERC ? 61,208, order on reh'g, 88 FERC ? 61,096
(1999), order on reh'g and clarification, 90 FERC ? 61,036 (2000).

As a general proposition, companies that have sought authority to sell
ancillary services in these ISO markets have simply requested the blanket
authorization for sales of ancillary services.  Many companies have added
that they desire the authority to be extended to additional ancillary
services and geographic markets, as the FERC may specify and authorize in
the future in orders that extend such authority to all sellers previously
authorized to sell energy and/or capacity at market-based rates.  See Edison
Mission Mktg. and Trading, Docket No. ER99-2434-000 (unpublished delegated
letter order issued May 7, 1999).

 The authority to make sales of ancillary services at market-based
rates is not, merely, limited to only those markets were established by the
FERC with operating ISOs.  The criteria for seeking such authority in
non-ISO markets is found in the Avista case.  See Avista Corp., 87 FERC -
61,223, reh'g granted, 89 FERC - 61,136 (1999) (""Avista"").  The problem
associated with obtaining market-based rates for ancillary services in
non-ISO markets has centered on the difficulty (or impossibility) of
obtaining estimates of other suppliers' abilities to supply ancillary
services to support a reliable market analysis that demonstrates that the
entity seeking such authority does not have market power in the relevant
markets for ancillary services.  However, in the Avista case, the FERC
authorized the provision of Regulation and Frequency Response, Energy
Imbalance, Operating Reserve - Spinning Reserve Service, and Operating
Reserve - Supplemental Reserve Service at market-based rates in non-ISO
markets with certain conditions.

 The Avista conditions require the Company to consider: (1) the
establishment of an internet site that provides information on, and
conducts, ancillary services transactions; (2) the posting on the internet
site of the offering prices of all available services; and (3) the ability
of customers to request services and make bids for those services using the
site.  Moreover, the entity must file with the FERC one year after the
internet site is operational, and at least three years thereafter, a report
describing its activities in the relevant ancillary services markets.  The
entity must also commit not to sell ancillary services at market-based rates
to:  (i) regional transmission organizations (""RTOs"") such as an ISO or
transco, i.e., where the RTO has no ability to self-supply ancillary
services but instead depends on third parties; (ii) a traditional franchised
public utility affiliated with the entity, or sales where the underlying
transmission is on the system of a public utility affiliated with the
entity; or (iii) a public utility that is purchasing ancillary services to
satisfy its own open access transmission tariff requirements to offer
ancillary services to its own customers.  Id. at 61,833, note 12.

 The terms and conditions associated with the provision of ancillary
services at market-based rates must be included in the market-based rate
schedule filed with the FERC and address the limitations on that authority
as discussed above.  For entities which have already obtained general
market-based rate authority, an amendment could be filed in their underlying
market-based rate dockets before the FERC seeking the authority to also sell
ancillary services at market-based rates consistent with the referenced FERC
precedent.

3133,"I am pleased to announce that effective July 1st the following individuals 
have been promoted from Director to Senior Director.  

Dan Allegretti - Dan has been a leader on both retail and wholesale 
electricity issues in New England for the past several years with Enron, 
resulting in Dan currently serving as Chair of the New England Power Pool 
Participants Committee.  Dan, more importantly, has been very active, both in 
the past and during the course of this year, in ensuring that transactional 
opportunities in the New England region are fully exploited by both Enron 
Wholesale Services and Enron Energy Services.  Dan's participation in the 
United Illuminating deal has been mentioned many times, but Dan has also 
played a critical role in working with Enron Energy Services this year in 
helping to develop a national business plan for creating value through the 
delivery of retail services in partnership with municipal and privately owned 
utilities.

Robert Hemstock - Rob's participation in the development of Alberta's 
competitive electricity market and the ensuing PPA project, that has produced 
considerable value for Enron and Enron Canada has been quite notable.  Rob 
has been a leader, not only with policy makers, but also with his commercial 
counterparts in ensuring that the PPA transaction was brought to fruition 
last year.  Rob has also played a critical role in preserving the value 
embedded in that deal throughout the course of this year.  Rob's knowledge of 
both wholesale and retail issues in both the natural gas and electricity 
industries in Western Canada is unparalleled.  

Sue Mara - Sue is a warrior.  Sue has fought endlessly and courageously 
during her years with Enron in trying to ensure, against all odds, that 
retail and wholesale electricity markets work as effectively as possible in 
California while also protecting Enron's interests in that very challenging 
state.  Sue is a passionate believer in the efficacy of markets, and fights 
tirelessly for both the issues as well as the well-being of the company in 
California.

Please join me in congratulating each of these individuals on their 
significant accomplishments.

 I've printed the budget report for your cost center.  

The cost center report indicates that the budget for outside services if 
8,685,000 so we will need to talk to Elizabeth or someone in accounting why 
that number is not 9,000,000.  

The cost center report indicates that we have spent 1,137,638.34 for outside 
services which leaves a variance to budget of 7,547,361.66 available.  

The RCR Budget Report indicates that we have approved 2,235,071 year to 
date.  If you take the amount spent for outside services plus the amount 
approved to date for RCR's the total equals 3,372,709.34.  If you take the 
3,372,709.34 less budget the variance is 5,312,290.66 available.  That 
assumes that the approved to date RCR will all be spent in 2001 and does not 
account for what has been spent to date for RCR costs.

The budget report for your cost center indicates that actuals year to date

DATE: April 6, 2001

RE: FERC Orders Issued April 6th (1) CalPX Chargebacks;
(2)CalPX  Rate Recalculations; and (3) Kern River
Certificate

We want to inform you of three significant orders FERC issued today, two 
relating to the California Power Exchange (CalPX), and the third concerning a 
pipeline project from Wyoming to California.

(1) Pacific Gas & Electric Company v. California Power Exchange Corporation, 
et al. (Docket Nos. EL01-29/33/36/37/43-000) ""Order on Complaints Concerning 
Use of Chargebacks and Liquidation of Collateral""
In this order, the Commission addressed five complaints against the CalPx 
concerning its response to alleged defaults by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) 
and Southern California Edison Company (SoCal Edison).  Among other things, 
the Commission determined that ""the chargeback provision in the PX tariff was 
not designed to address default of this magnitude and, thus, its application 
in these circumstances is unjust and unreasonable.""  Accordingly, the 
Commission directed the CalPX to rescind all prior chargeback actions and 
refrain from any future chargeback actions relating to PG&E and SoCal 
Edison's liabilities, subject to further Commission action in accordance with 
the order.
Regarding the ultimate question of how the PX should account for the 
nonpayments by SoCal Edison and PG&E, the Commission deferred further action 
pending the outcome of SoCal Edison's State Court Complaint, as well as the 
Government Claims Board Complaint.  Finally, with respect to the PX's 
bankruptcy proceeding, the Commission concluded that section 362(b)(4) of the 
Bankruptcy Code allowed it to lawfully exercise its regulatory power under 
sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act, so long as it did not threaten 
the bankruptcy court's control over the property of the bankruptcy estate.

(2) San Diego Gas & Electric Company v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary 
Services (Docket Nos. EL00-95-015/016 and Docket Nos. EL00-98-014/015) ""Order 
Dismissing Rehearing, Accepting Compliance Filing, and Directing the 
Recalculation of Lower Wholesale Rates""
In this order, the Commission dismissed the CalPX's request for rehearing of 
the Commission's January 29, 2001 order, which found that the CalPX had 
violated the Commission's December 15, 2000 order and the Federal Power Act.  
The December 15 order required the CalPX to pay suppliers in the CalPX 
markets their as-bid price above the $150/MWh breakpoint.  Additionally, the 
Commission accepted the PX's compliance filing and provided guidance to the 
PX on an acceptable methodology so that the PX may implement the $150/MWh 
breakpoint for its January 1, 2001 invoices.  Additionally, as in the 
chargeback case, the Commission determined that its action in the instant 
case was exempt from the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code.

(3) Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Docket No. CP01-106-000) ""Order 
Issuing Certificate""
Pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, the Commission denied the 
protests that had been filed and issued a certificate of public convenience 
and necessity to Kern River authorizing it to construct and operate its 
California Action Project, subject to resolution of the proceeding pending in 
Docket No. CP01-61-000.  However, the Commission rejected Kern River's 
proposal to utilize a return on equity for this project of 15.25 percent.  
Instead, the Commission directed Kern River to file a revised incremental 
rate to reflect a return on equity of 13.25 percent at least 30 days prior to 
commencing service.  Finally, the Commission conditioned the certificate on 
Kern River's compliance with the environmental conditions set forth in 
Appendix C to the order.

These orders can be found on the Bulk Power section of FERC's website, at 
www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm.  If you have any questions, comments 
or would like additional information relating to these orders, please contact

The Texas Electric MarketPlace Works"" 
Also, could you please replace the document referring to key legislative 
affecting the energy market with the latest version.  Thanks, Jean Ryall

3139,"You were quite right on the topic of gas prices in California. I looked
through some articles I have been collecting that make reference to an
investigation by the FERC into alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp
in the context of the price basis between San Juan and Topock. You probably

3141,"I thought that you would be interested in the feedback from the Board of 
Trade Electricity Taskforce meeting this morning:                          a) 
On the weekend, May 4- 6, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce unanimously adopted 
the Toronto Board of Trade's  position paper re market opening on November 1, 
2001.   The OCC is the umbrella organization of all local chambers of 
commerce/ boards of trade across Ontario.  The Toronto Board of Trade 
position paper largely follows the Enron position paper re market 
opening.                              b) Elyse Allan, Louise Verity and Jan 
Carr (all representing the Toronto Board of Trade) met with Minister Wilson 
and Judy Hubert on Tuesday, May 8. Wilson explicitly asked the BOT to ""keep 
up the heat"" on a November 1 opening. Wilson was evidently very impressed by 
the OCC resolution.                       c) Some concern was expressed  by 
David McFadden (head of SAC and BE's lawyer)   that  OPG may not put the 
fossil units on the block until August, since the Ministry of the 
Environment's new emissions regulations will not be promulgated until that 
time.  Paul might want to raise this with Gord Homer: I don't see why OPG 
would have to wait until August  to begin the process; the substance of the 
regs are known now, even if they are not law until 
August.                       d) A fight is brewing between the City of 
Toronto and the Province regarding the Hearn facility.  The City wants to 
tear it down  as part of their waterfront plan but the Province is pushing to 
keep it as a generation facility of some type. The IMO has evidently prepared 
a report on the issue that has not yet been made 
public.                                        e)There was a push from some 
taskforce members (particularly Jan Carr) to adopt, as a transitional 
measure, some type of controls to limit exports and control prices in 
Ontario.  This was a non-starter with most of the members of the taskforce 
and that initiative will not go forward. I have undertaken, instead,  to give 
the BOT some talking points that they can use in answering questions about  
interregional trade and the type of comments that Howard Hampton  (NDP 
leader) is making about the US sucking cheap power out of Ontario. "

ANCILLARY SERVICES - THE NEXT FRONTIER

 Since the issuance of Order Nos. 888-889 by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (""Commission"") in 1996, market recognition of the
value of ancillary services provided in this regulatory initiative, has
increased dramatically.  Shortly thereafter, the FERC recognized that
market-based rates could also be provided for certain of these ancillary
services, which include voltage regulation, spinning reserves, non-spinning
reserves and reactive power that were critical elements of historically
bundled service.  This regulatory recognition was intended to serve as a
stimulus for market penetration and development of ancillary services in a
competitive marketplace.  With the formation of independent system operators
(ISOs) and the consideration of movement to regional transmission
organizations (RTOs), ancillary services have received increased discussion
and attention.  Frequently, markets do not have yet sufficient market makers
to create adequate transparencies in a robust competitive market for certain
services.  For example, because of market deficiencies in California and New
York, ancillary services have come under increased scrutiny.

 This short history and limited development of ancillary services is
about to change with the advent of material consideration of RTOs.  It can
be expected that a revamped Bush-era FERC will finalize most RTO proposals
this summer undertaken by former Chairman James Hoecker and his colleagues
on the Commission.  That process should conclude by the end of 2001 with
increased enforcement and market monitoring, new mechanisms to resolve
disputes, increased resolution of seams management concerns, new
transmission pricing and return policies, and major market validation of
for-profit transcos as the underlying vehicle for regional growth and
development of transmission in the future.

Key Considerations

 This market growth and recognition will not come too quickly given
the continual demise of transmission investment and development by the
regulated utility industry.  Over the past 25 years the utility industry has
whittled away its transmission legacy, with little real growth and
development of the national transmission system to support the advent and
movement to competitive markets which has accelerated since 1988.  Ancillary
services will become a critical element of that market as they become the
future call-waiting, *69, and call-forward services of the electric utility
industry - borrowing from the telephone industry parallels and paradigm from
the prior decade of experience.  Formation of RTOs will provide stronger
market validation and recognition of ancillary services.  This will
necessitate the development of separate pricing, new forms of contracting,
new revised pricing methodologies for those ancillary services through
separate contracts, and pricing opportunities through formal agreements.  In
many instances, agreements still need to be developed for ancillary service
sales or need to be materially enhanced in existing service agreements with
the electric utility.  Several areas require current consideration at this
time to ensure a smooth and effective transition:

* Interconnection agreements should fully anticipate the separate
provision of ancillary services in their technical review of a generating
facility and requirements for that facility with the electric utility.
* The interface of utility systems with control areas and RTO's need
further understanding and management for risks, liabilities and cost
consequences.
* Recognition for adequate compensation and market-based pricing for
ancillary services should be provided with the opportunity to supplement
that pricing with amended and restated schedules in relevant agreements.
* Transition of existing transmission and interconnection agreements
to the RTOs should be contemplated in current agreements.  Assignment of
those agreements should only be permitted with appropriate notice and review
rights by the generator, and the opportunity to accept, amend or reject the
terms of that assignment or transfer depending on whether it provides for
enhanced sale and market development opportunities for the market value of
ancillary services.
* There are other ancillary services yet to unfold that have not been
recognized by Order Nos. 888-889 and they should be analyzed and evaluated.
Any specificity that can be undertaken to capture recognition of those
future services, including development and pricing opportunities for those
services, should be separately retained in existing agreements now.
Otherwise, the spectre exists that those services may ultimately be provided
to the regulated utility at no charge.
Future Course of Action
Why has this occurred?  Individual utilities managing the needs of their
systems - with the public utility obligation to serve and paramount
reliability responsibilities were not willing to separately recognize the
value of ancillary services.  Bundled service also disguised this value and
did not provide an adequate and accurate platform for such recognition.
Utility divestitures of generation resources started the ball running.
Moreover, utilities operating in a monopoly, cost-of-service regime did not
have the incentive or ability to seek out new revenue streams through
creative unbundling and repackaging of ancillary services.  With the
evolution to RTOs and broader scope and markets, a shift will be undertaken
in the provision of ancillary services, such as security, emergency
planning, risk management, and reliability from discrete utility systems to
all potential players in the competitive market, including generators,
regulated utilities, transmitting utilities, power marketers and traders and
large scale industrial and commercial users.  This restructuring of the
market also provides an enhanced opportunity to assess the delivery of
critical ancillary services, their recognition as a matter of contract, and
the appropriate elements of market-based rates and cost of service analysis
(as applicable) and new methodologies justifying pricing for these new,
essential products.

 Enlightened generators and developers will be thoughtfully analyzing
this issue at this time with the goal of protecting their interests in
anticipation of the evolution of these ancillary services as part of
competitive markets, which will allow them to capture contracting and
pricing opportunities for the benefit of their owners or shareholders.

Please find attached a short memo regarding last week's call with Jim and
the Enron RTO team. It also has some thoughts on what we might cover with
Steve K. at 2:00 p.m. CDT today.

Some other time I would like to have a quick chat about how we move to the
next step with the RTOs. It strikes me that there has been a real absence of
cleare-headed thinking in the stakeholder chin-wagging sessions. If FERC
will not impose a single design - on an abbreviated timeframe - is there
another way to add some economic logic into the equation?

Eight new projects--of which some are significant in size-- have been added 
to the list of the hot deals for May 25th, 2001.  They--and their suggested 
action items--are as follows:

 Project  Originator  Description     
EBS:
 Advertising JV  Erik Simpson  EBS to provide risk management to media 
buyer   ($28 million)
 Raven   Jeff Donahue  Purchase assets of managed hosting company ($400 
million)
 Samsung DRAM Ken Wang  1 month financing of DRAM Inventory (5 million)

Suggested Action Item:  Communicate findings to Sue Nord and compile GA 
comments for RAC, if any.  Lisa Yoho is also informed given the very 
interesting structure of Samsung DRAM deal that is likely to be repeated with 
other seriously backwardated commodities.  
EWS/EGM
 Weirton   Tammy Mulroony  Rolled Steal forward purchase ($ 75 million)
 Timber      Sale of 100 MM asset at cost  ($100 million)
 DPR accelerated put Mike Beyer  Exercise Put and reinvest in coal related 
assets  ($11 million) 
Suggest Action Item:  Communicate findings to J. Steffes, and Lisa Yoho and 
compile GA comments for RAC, if any.

Finally, I am taking the liberty to contact Paul Kaufman to inform him of 
project PortMorrow which is the developing of 47 MW peaking facility in 
Oregon for PGE (originator Chuck Randall).  I shall follow up with him in 
case that there are any needed action item.  

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.

3152,"Rick,

Just wanted to give you a ""heads up"" that I will be digging around the DOJ 
regarding satellite issues as we have a potential antitrust issue on that 
front.  According to Fred Enochs (runs the satellite book for Fallon), 
satellite providers (and there are only a few of them to begin with) will not 
sell capacity to EBS unless we agree to their contractual terms regarding 
resale -- i.e., we cannot resell any satellite capacity that the provider 
sells to EBS.  As we are interested in trading satellite capacity, this type 
of restriction prevents players like EBS from creating/entering new markets 
for resale.  I have already touched base with Jade and she has promised to 
find the appropriate person for me to talk to.  

FYI: Fallon would like to see this prohibition attacked as well.  The three 
of us have discussed it.  I advised Fred that I would need either a contract 
from one of the providers that includes the restrictive language or some 
correspondence (e-mail or regular mail) that documents this activity; he is 
working on it.  As it turns out, Jamie Ginsberg's new company contacted EBS 
about satellite capacity and she related similar information to Fred 
regarding her own experiences with satellite providers.  As a result, we may 
be able to gather some useful information from her that we could reference at 
the DOJ to support our case.

I'll keep you posted as further developments arise.  

Hope you're enjoying San Antonio.

"
3155,"Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to 
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond 
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt 
from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from 
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services 
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it 
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but 
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by 
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying 
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only 
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from 
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took 
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the 
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree 
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create 
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include 
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what 
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with 
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it 
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to 
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short 
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby 
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity 
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to 
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches 
to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct 
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that 
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if 
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and 
passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Best,
Jeff"

3157,"Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws,"" said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. ""If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void."" 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 
""It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,"" Ahern said. ""It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover."" 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp. (CPN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), according to the report. 
Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report. "

3165,"Below is a rough estimate of the book impact if ComEd succeeds in ending PPO 
early.  That is, if they terminate PPO starting Jan. 2005 it should cost us 
$1.2m, if they want to terminate Jan. 2004 it would be an impact of $3.1m 
($1.2m for 2005 + $1.9m for 2004), etc.



These costs can be reduced with a liquid market for wholesale power and 
ancillary services.

"
3166,"Rick, I should have copied you on this.  
"
3167,"I would add to what Teun says below a good lesson from California for the 
Dutch: Disconnect the functioning of the retail and wholesale markets at your 
peril. If bad regulatory/ political  intervention gets in the way of 
participation by new and old players in both on a level playing field, 
fingers will get burnt. In the Netherlands the incumbent generators and 
vertically integrated distributors have been given unfair advantages in a 
non-transparent manner in the wholesale market, whilst enjoying more or less 
guaranteed prices in the retail market. New entrants/ importers got squeezed 
and most consumers have not yet enjoyed the full benefits of liberalisation. 
Incidentally, in both California and the Netherlands there was excessive 
political trumpeting of the benefits and of the enlightenment of policymakers 
in advance, followed by a mess in practice.

Cal's problem.  Ray

3169,"We had a good visit with the FERC staff yesterday.  Their questions primarily 
focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different

questions:

1.  What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL?
2.  What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk 
management of Enron's gas and power trading.  For example, what is the 
ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the

Approximately 40% of delivery service customers were using the PPO.  Approx. 
8 marketers are active in Com Ed with only 3or 4 acquiring significant 
numbers of customers.

2.  ICC believes retail prices may increase dramatically in 2005 by the time 
the general rate freeze expires.

3.  ICC is concerned about wholesale competition noting that utilization of 
the PPO evidences little physical delivery by suppliers.  ICC is also 
concerned about the ability of the Illinois transmission system to support a 
competitive wholesale market within and between utilities.  The number of 
TLR's attained record levels last years and there are concerns about managing 
load pockets.  If the situation remains unchanged, retail prices will be 
higher than they would have been had the market structure supported wholesale 
competition.

4.  Non-Coincident Peak demand in Illinois in 1999 was 29,561Mw and 28,040MW 
in 2000, however overall growth in demand is 1.4%.

5. The most successful suppliers are either Illinois utilities or affiliates 
of Illinois gas and electric utilities, raising market power concerns.

6.  ICC is investigating the capacity of the Illinois utilities' transmission 
and distribution systems.  As part of the study, the ICC will be developing a 
comprehensive computer simulation model of the regional transmission grid to 
identify problem spots on the grid including potential load pockets as well 
as inter-utility constraints that may limit wholesale deliveries during 
critical peak hours.  This will assist in state and federal proceedings.

7.  The ICC is concerned about the market power exercised by utilities and 
has been collecting data  on each utility's interconnection and transmission 
queues to watch for signs of favoritism directed towards their affiliates  or 
any other violations of FERC Order 888.

Hope this is useful.

3176,"PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the 
past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's 
electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small 
customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States 
Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to 
achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in 
California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from 
the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the 
utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers 
would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close 
devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the 
utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January 
and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR 
contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore 
structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the 
contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large 
customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR 
contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to 
address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) 
killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure 
focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not 
include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any 
""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract 
provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the 
state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might 
reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear 
that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally 
abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some 
options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the 
core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM 
PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let 
me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff"

order WSCC refunds prior to the July 2, 2001 refund effective date 
established in the June 19 Order (which FERC could attempt to do by revising 
its previous dismissal of Puget's complaint on rehearing, which is pending.)

My guess is that FERC will not wish to give up the leverage that it has on 
this front, and thus will sit on Puget's motion to withdrawal for the time 
being while the settlement efforts are ongoing.

3182,"FYI : this is the pack for the revised CE2 forecast for Gov Affairs.  It 
shows an 18% reduction on the original budget from $13.5m to $11.2m.  (CE1 
Forecast was $11.8m) . For rest of year, we merely scaled down T&E on the 
basis of the reduced headcount that had been given back in the CE1 forecast.  
(Forecast headcount to end of year is 25 vs 32 in original budget).  There 
may still be opportunities in Audit & Legal / Consultancy combined once we 
begin to review the contracts.
In Q2 we came in  $1.3m under the previous forecast, but we've just rephased 
that to the end of the year and kept it in the forecast on the basis that 
there may still be bills to come through.  Stephen Wood thinks that Michael 
may get tough and challenge why we can't release the underspend, but I think 
he ought to be sympathetic to our discussions on the possibility of a bigger 
regulatory battle later in the year and keep it in for that reason.

3186,"On Friday, July 6th, we had an excellent first meeting with Com Ed. 

In attendence from Enron were Rogers Herndon, Marc Ulrich, Jeff Merola, Brad 
Snyder, Guy Sharfman and myself.  (Roy Boston and our attorney Chris Townsend 
attended our pre-meeting discussion but did not attend at ComEd to keep our 
numbers down).

In attendence from Com Ed were Pam Strobel President, Exelon Energy Delivery 
Company and Vice Chair, ComEd; Frank Clark, Ex. V.P. Customer Marketing and 
Energy Delivery Services, ComEd; Gerald Rhodes, President, Exelon Energy; 
Arlene Juracek, Vice President, Regulatory & Strategic Services, ComEd; John 
McCawley, Director, Electric and Gas Choice; and Michael Freeman, Long-Term 
Trader, Exelon Power Team.

During the course of the meeting, we delivered our message that we, like 
ComEd, wanted to see a competitive market emerge in Illinois, but that we had 
concern that lifting the PPO early without the presence of a competitive 
market could create a California-like situation - which is what they were 
striving to avoid - because their approach would leave buyers on the 
competitive market without having any sellers due to problems with physical 
delivery.  We indicated our concern for our existing customers and our 
ability to grow our business in Illinois.  We stressed the PJM model as a 
workable solution that creates a liquid market.  There was much enthusiasm on 
the part of ComEd for focusing ICC attention on creating that kind of a 
solution for Illinois.  Arlene Juracek encouraged us to work with them on 
this and to meet with Steve Nauman and Celia David.  Since Mike Roan and I 
will be in Illinois on this Tuesday and Wednesday, first to hear the 
Alliance's presentation to the ICC and then for Mike to make a presentation 
the following day, we are going to try and meet with them.

One of our objectives was to set up a team between Enron and ComEd to go 
through the requirements and nuts and bolts of physical delivery into 
Illinois.  This was accomplished and Jeff Merola and Mark Ulrich witll be 
meeting  with Ann McGlin at ComEd to get a better understanding of what we 
can and cannot do to achieve physical delivery.  Also, Michael Freeman 
indicated a willingness to sell us a structured retail product to help us 
achieve physical delivery (energy and/or load following services), and made 
it clear that whatever deal we do with the Exelon Power team would be 
independent and separate from any deal we might do with ComEd on the PPO 
front.  Once we have completed our discussions with Ann McGlin and with 
Michael Freeman, we will meet again with ComEd to negotiate what we need for 
physical delivery.  

We also discussed other aspects of the ComEd letter to the ICC and received 
the following clarifications.  Customers going off the PPO before 2004 would 
be offered rate 6L which is a bundled rate.  After 2004, ComEd plans to go to 
real time pricing on a day ahead or hourly basis.  As to whether the CTC 
could be reinstated after a customer was dropped from PPO, they indicated 
that they had not thought about it, but believed the law would allow this.  
Arlene Juracek, however, commented that they could lock in a CTC agreement 
with a customer.  I interpret that to mean that as part of an agreement to 
support ComEd in its proposal, we may be able to guarantee that for our 
customers, the CTC will not reemerge if market prices go down or that we can 
negotiate a limited CTC, etc.  

We also pointed out that we had other concerns like ComEd's unwillingness to 
negotiate the Supplier Agreement.  Not much time was spent on that but my 
sense is that if this is an obstacle to getting our concurrence, we may be 
able to work through this as well.

Frank Clark asked us about our willingness to take on the role of supplier of 
last resort and we responded that we needed first to be sure that we could 
physically deliver to customers.  Once that hurdle is addressed, we would be 
willing to consider that possibility.

The ComEd negotiating team will meet in Houston on either the morning of July 
16th or 17th when we believe the tasks with ComEd will be completed, in order 
to evaluate what we have learned and what our next steps should be.  I will 
then arrange a follow-up meeting with Pam Strobel and her team.

3188,"A bill introduced in Ohio would have required Enron to become certified and 
pay the OCC and PUCO assessments.  Other provisions called for allowing the 
LDC to tack on a surcharge to recover from all customers the additional costs 
incurred as a result of a defaulting supplier.  Further provisions allow for 
a municipal aggregation pilot with the authority granted to the PUCO to allow 
the program to be expanded to all municipalities at the end of three years.  
At that point, the utilities could seek stranded costs, however it is 
questionable how much they would actually have.

Fortunately, we were able to get an amendment that limited the applicability 
of all these regulations and costs (assessments, surcharges and stranded 
costs) to just the ""choice"" customers.  Choice customers are primarily 
residential customers operating under the PUCO approved programs established 
in the Columbia, East Ohio and Cinergy service territories.  The threshold 
for regulation, etc is to exempt a mercantile customer who is defined as "" a 
customer that consumes, other than for residential use, more than five 
hundred thousand cubic feet of natural gas per year at a single location 
within this state or is part of an undertaking having more than three 
locations within or outside this state.""  This should cover most, if not all 
our customers.

The status of the bill is that it has passed committee and the Speaker is 
going to pass it out of the House without amendment.  We are hearing that the 
Senate will accept no amendments either, however, that remains to be seen.  
Barbara and I are monitoring this closely and will keep you posted.

3189,"Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data
Power: Senator says the generator is refusing to make public some information 
crucial to the price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying.
CARL INGRAM
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 10 2001

SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price 
gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy 
is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation.

Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding information 
from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But 
under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public without 
Duke's consent.

The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have 
alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in 
January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the 
electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout 
the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation and 
efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential 
information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.

Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 
gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and 
which stay secret.

""The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what 
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less,"" he said.

Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers

Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information 
elsewhere and ""release it over Duke's objections.""

Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month 
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in what 
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.

But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the 
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity 
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its 
explanation.

Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full 
picture of the plant's operation during the three days.

But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, 
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, 
Duke was guilty of the same tactics.

""Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full 
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions 
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred,"" Dunn said.

To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive 
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine ""the bids Duke 
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant."" They include the 
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.

Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in 
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and 
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.

Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to 
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke 
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the 
committee plans to turn over.

""We are complying now,"" Williams said. ""There is some suggestion that we are 
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't 
know what we are ultimately going to do.""

The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they 
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have 
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, 
were cited.

Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are 
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally 
charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the 
final arbiter of such issues.

Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited 
for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most 
recent case, a cement company executive was sent to jail.

Ghost of Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol 
Gray Davis is following footsteps of former O.C. treasurer into fiscal chaos




JOHN M.W. MOORLACH 
Mr. Moorlach is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector. 

A recent L.A. Times poll found that Californians still remain unconvinced 
that our state suffers from a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state's 
subsidizing of the actual costs for electricity these past five months has 
caused us to believe that everything is fine. It is not. 
The state has been spending an average of $57 million, a medium-sized city's 
annual budget, per day for electricity. Now California is headed toward the 
same financial catastrophe that was imposed on its shareholder-owned 
utilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and another on the 
precipice. At this pace, it will not be long before the state will be staring 
a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face. 
That's why I'm gnawed by this ""d,j. vu"" sensation. The similarities and 
parallels between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are 
frightening. Here's a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer 
Robert Citron, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. 
The ""experts"" and the ""politicos"" were comfortable with the investment 
scheme. 
No wonder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing 
improprieties. Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how 
he was investing and what his ""exit strategy"" would be. Guess what? The 
unexpected happened. Short-term borrowing rates doubled. The cost of 
borrowing suddenly exceeded the revenues being generated. 
It caused the investment pool to implode and Orange County taxpayers realized 
a $1.64 billion loss. In spite of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck 
the county's leadership, he ignored it. The rest is history. In a 
half-pregnant deregulation scheme, the state capped the retail price that the 
utilities can charge. It also eliminated the availability to acquire 
electricity through the use of long-term contracts. 
Guess what? The unexpected happened. The wholesale price for electricity 
spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap. It depleted the 
available funds for the utilities, and then some, and they are imploding. In 
spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov. Gray Davis to avoid or 
minimize this train wreck, he ignored them. The rest is also history. 
It gets worse. Davis doesn't allow for the immediate raising of retail rates 
and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity. Guess what? The 
expected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves! Nearly $9 
billion - and counting! He's a Citron, only quintupled! 
And in the light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced 
and only compound this financial nightmare. Gov. Davis has done what no 
Libertarian or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time. He 
has returned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of 
California by subsidizing their electricity bills. 
Bravo! It may not be the most equitable way of refunding taxes, but has 
anyone ever thought up a more efficient method? But, that's not all. He wants 
it back! Davis now wants to borrow some $13 billion to replace the spent 
reserves and purchase even more electricity at rates in excess of the retail 
prices! When does this train wreck in slow motion stop? 
And how do we pay off these bonds? Davis did not want to raise rates last 
summer or this past winter. But now he will to pay off this historically 
largest municipal bond offering with a significant utility rate increase. The 
ratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after Davis is gone about his 
expensive brilliance. And this elected official wants to purchase the power 
grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities? I say ""no."" 
If we don't show some leadership in Sacramento soon, potential bond buyers 
will also say ""no,"" unless they receive an attractive interest rate. Just ask 
Edison International about attractive interest rates. It just subscribed $800 
million in bonds paying 14 percent. Tragically, Gov. Davis walked into his 
position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangible legacy to 
show for it. No reserves. No improved highways. No new schools. No 
infrastructure improvements. Only interest payments. 
Wasn't that Citron's legacy? If amortized over 10 years at 6 percent, the 
citizens of California will pay an additional $4.4 billion in interest costs. 
Over 15 years it's $6.7 billion. And therein lies the true legacy of Davis, 
squandering the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting 
from his indecisiveness and lack of leadership! 
It is so tragic that the perpetrator of this colossal mess is still in denial 
and continues to play the ""blame game."" Orange County played the ""blame 
game,"" too. But it had obvious perpetrators and succeeded in a court of law 
in securing a significant amount in retribution payments. I'm not so sure 
California will have a similar result.

3192,"Last night I attended the National Republican Senatorial Committee's 
reception at Senator Frist's home in DC.  (Frist is the NRSC chairman this 
cycle.)  Enron, including Jeff and Linda, had been invited to the reception, 
the purpose of which was to introduce ex-RNC chairman Haley Barbour as the 
NRSC's National Finance Chairman.  Present were over a dozen Republican 
senators, including Minority Leader Lott, Whip Nickles, and Sens. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, Bunning (KY), Fitzgerald (IL), Cochran (MS), Inhofe (OK), Bond 
(MO), Crapo (ID), Voinovich (OH), Allen (VA), and Chafee (RI).

The ""news"" from our perspective is that Haley Barbour singled out Ken Lay for 
praise as the first person to step to the plate and agree to help with their 
new ""Majority Makers"" program.  This is the effort that Barbour will head up 
to raise $21 million for this election cycle by concentrating on events 
outside DC that would target businesses and business leaders without a DC 
presence.  Barbour said that Ken had agreed to organize and chair a Houston 
fundraiser to raise $1 million toward the $21 million total.  Ken was the 
first name he mentioned.  The only others were the DeVos family in Michigan 
and Julie Finley, a major GOP fundraiser based in DC.

Needless to say, I was suddenly quite ""popular"" after Haley made his remarks 
to the assembled group.  Haley said he looked forward to working with us on 
this project.

As you know from a previous e-mail, Pat Shortridge had earlier seen our 
mutual friend Mitch Bainwol, the executive director of the NRSC, who had told 
Pat at lunch last week that Haley had spoken with Ken, but last night was the 
first I had heard a dollar figure -- and a big one at that -- linked to the 
effort.  While it was not stated, I assume from the location and size of the 
event's goal that the President would be involved (but this is only an 
educated assumption on my part).

Later I saw Karen Hughes of the White House staff, but I do not think she was 
present when Haley made his comments."

3194,"I had a conference call with Michael Guerriero, Juli?n Poole and Andrea Calo 
regarding the information Enron must submit to ACEERA, the power marketers 
association, next Monday morning, to be included in ACEERA's presentation to 
the Secretariat of Energy.
I will make the first draft of the information we will submit next Monday 
morning, that will cover points 9 to 13 below. My draft must be ready 
tomorrow afternoon.
In order to do it, I will apreciate if you could give material to support the 
following main guidelines (in blue) we would follow.
The material could include papers, letters, documents, and international 
examples I could mention, explaining the benefits of following these criteria 
and how should they be implemented.

9. Criteria for the treatment of Marketers' activities.
They are not a public service
Marketers should daily declare their offered prices (as gencos) for their 
forcasted firm supply to be included in the determination of daily dispatch 
and spot prices. This could reduce the supply concentration.
Warranties required to Marketers. All players in the spot market should 
present similar warranties.
Right to interrupt the service for customer default. How can this be 
implemented?
It should be allowed to act as both marketers or brokers.

10. Criteria for the treatment of large users.
All gencos, marketers, distcos and large users must be authorized to be both 
the buyer and seller in the foward contracts market

11. Criteria for the treatment of supply contracts.

12.  Criteria for transferring to end users market prices.
Possibility to include in the pass through the cost of hedging products. Did 
we get this approved anywhere in USA? Where? How is the pass through done 
(procedure)?
Full unbundling is better than pass through, since prices can be determined 
by supply and demand

13.  Criteria for  functioning of the forward market.
All gencos, marketers, distcos and large users must be authorized to be both 
the buyer and seller in the foward contracts market
Elimination of minimum terms and volumes in this market
Free prices and conditions
Forward market contracts do not require former aproval to be executed. 
Only LDC's contracts to be included in the pass through to rates should be 
subject to regulation.

And any other point you consider relevant to make related to these subjects

I will appreciate any information you could give me as soon as possible.

3195,"At yesterday's FERC meeting the Commission voted out an order in the Alliance 
RTO proceeding.  This is another example how the new Commission, changed with 
two new members, can put more teeth in the RTO process.  The order requires 
Alliance to establish an independent board to make all the business decisions 
for the RTO until final approval for the RTO is granted.  Further, the order 
directs that a stakeholder advisory committee should advise the independent 
board.  FERC is concerned that business decisions prior to implementation of 
the Alliance RTO are made solely by the Alliance Companies.  The order 
directs Alliance Companies to decide which alternative business plans they 
intend to implement and file with the FERC within 45 days.  

Commissioner Massey issued a concurrence with the order in which he argues 
for the establishment of a mediation proceeding (like Northeast and 
Southeast) to direct the two RTOs - Alliance and MISO - to work to develop a 
single Midwest RTO.  Though Massey did not get any other votes for this 
process now, Commissioners Wood,  Brownell and Hebert, seemed to support the 
objective of single regional RTOs in the four main regions of the country, 
including NE, SE, MW and West.

Although no commitments were made, it is quite possible that FERC will order 
a mediation-type proceeding (as in NE and SE) if the Alliance RTO does not 
expand its scope in the near future.

Attached is a summary of the order.

"
3197,"Late tonight, the Barton Subcommittee passed an energy policy package 
(without any electricity provisions other than those related to conservation) 
on a bipartisan vote of 29-1.  The subcommittee approved an amendment by Mrs. 
Wilson to conduct a national assessment and inventory of possible renewable 
energy projects.

During consideration of the bill, several amendments of interest and concern 
to Enron were offered and withdrawn; they are likely to be offered when the 
full Energy and Commerce Committee meets to consider the package next Tuesday 
and Wednesday.  The amendments in this category are:

1. Mr. Waxman has an amendment he called the ""blackout and price gouging 
prevention amendment"" that would require FERC to modify its June 19 price 
mitigation order within 15 days of enactment to impose cost-of-service based 
rates (with a rate of return of 15 percent) if an entity is found to be 
withholding power from the grid during an emergency.  The cost-of-service 
rates would thereafter apply to all of the offending entity's sales in the 
Western U.S.  Several of us were rounding up opponents to the amendment when 
it was clear he was going to offer it and before he decided to withdraw it 
until full committee.  We will continue those efforts before the full 
committee vote.

2. Mr. Ganske has an amendment on net metering that he said would promote 
wind in Iowa and other renewables (he may wait until an electricity bill 
rather than full committee on this bill).

3. Mr. Shadegg has an amendment to exempt natural gas pipelines from the 
requirements of the National Registry of Historic Places.  He said that 
currently this process holds up much needed pipeline expansions that are FERC 
approved.

4. Mr. Waxman has an amendment that would require the President to develop 
and implement a plan to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions called for in a 
UN agreement that President George Bush (""41"") agreed to in 1992 (reducing 
these emissions to 1990 levels).

Chairman Barton indicated that the Subcommittee will take up an electric 
restructuring bill either later this month or early in September, depending 
on how long it takes to process this first energy package in the full 
committee and in the full House."

3199,"Here is a copy of the economists letter the Independent Institute released on 
health care.  It is about 330 words long.
  
http://independent.org/tii/news/OpenLetterHealthCare0002.html
 

Here is my first draft of a letter to economists for power price caps.  It is 
275 words long, so we have some room.



The tricky thing here is the interplay between retail and wholesale price 
regulation that is not present in other price control situations.  In other 
words, the public utility nature of retail prices complicates things a bit, 
so our letter will have to be careful about not losing support from 
economists who wonder if this is really about a natural monopoly 
situation--at retail at least.

Maybe instead of price decontrol at retail we can just call for a move toward 
real-time pricing.

Comments appreciated.

We are within 5% of SCE's negative CTC calculation up to January 17 (approx. 
$125 million).  However, as you can see from the attached chart, SCE would 
give us a $60 million-plus haircut with the methodology they are proposing 
for calculating negative CTC for post-Jan. 18.  Our protest to this

organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=

=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=

will=20
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=
l=20
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=

natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20

Attached below is language for a national renewable energy credit trading

benefit of this program.  This program would be a big win for us, and I'm 
glad to assist you and your staff in any meetings to promote this program.  

After comparing the definition of renewable energy under title IX, Sect 981, 
it is nearly identical to the democratic draft.  Therefore, I don't have any

Enron has consented to allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to search the Enron Building and to interview employees regarding allegations of document destruction.  The company encourages all employees to fully cooperate with the FBI.

The company has retained Michael Levy and his law firm Swidler, Berlin, Shereff, Friedman, to advise any employee regarding this matter and to be present with them during any interviews by government investigators.  If you would like to speak with an attorney, please contact Ned Crady of the Legal Department at 3-4558 or contact Michael Levy's office in Washington, D.C. at 202-295-8414 and they will direct you to him here in Houston."
3221,"Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.

Also, in part because of the combined calling of Noble Systems users along with the 16,000 agents working for Teleperformance (our $700 million plus parent), we can now also secure for you a 2.5 cent per minute call rate on T1 traffic. And you need not even be a Noble Systems user to take advantage of this package. Please advise and I'll get this information to you.

Current hot items on our product side include extending our skills-based routing from inbound to answering outbound predictive traffic.

In addition to now providing fully automated credit card authorizations, our integrated IVR (Interactive Voice Response) can also do just about any application including automated surveys, automated appointment confirmations, etc.

And, most importantly, PerfectScript can now improve both agent productivity and agent retention more than any single innovation in the past several years. With PerfectScript, agents may pre-record portions of their presentations, rebuttals, mirandas etc. At their discretion, the appropriate pre-recorded voice segment plays in lieu of the agent responding; totally seamless and without clicks etc. so that the other party is not aware that the agent is not really speaking. At any time your agent may stop the recorded play by simply touching the keyboard space bar and continue in his/her own voice.

Another PerfectScript benefit is that the enthusiasm with which they record their rebuttals tends to be maintained throughout every conversation for optimal results.

And yet another very important benefit of PerfectScript is that agents may pre-record their initial call introduction: ""Hello, this is Dan. May I speak with"" at which point your agent then speaks the called party's name and continues on.

Jeffrey, have a great week and whenever I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to call or email me back.

The 3rd annual Forbes-Milken Institute Best Places Ranking was released today, showing what cities are the best for business and careers.
What city do you think is number one this year? Well, just go to http://www.milkeninstitute.org  or http://www.forbes.com/bestplaces  to find out.
This annual ranking of the top 200 metropolitan areas in the United States (with a separate ranking for 94 small metros) looks at which metros are the most dynamic based on jobs and earnings growth, and high-technology growth and output. 
All of the numbers were provided by the Institute's Regional and Demographic Studies group as part of its ongoing research into how high-tech impacts regional economies.
If you have any questions about the Forbes-Milken Institute ranking, or if you wish more information about the Institute or the high-tech work of the Regional Studies group, please contact us at (310) 998-2600.
We hope this is of interest to you.

Both a West Desk and East Desk have been established.  I am continuing to work closely with Elliot and Richard.  On the retail side, we're putting together product descriptions for the originators to put before current and new customers.

3232,"Before I took on the ERCOT responsibilities, I was working with other EPSA members in preparation for the upcoming DOE sponsored forum to develop a wholesale electric standards setting organanization.

Since my move, it is likely that I will not be attending this workshop.  I have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop, there was a possibility that I would be speaking on behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC showdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating much fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/infrastructure and EISB's reknowned (including FERC) consensus building process.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise, however, lose its biased voting process.

I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting, either, by someone on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC approach, or a clean slate EISB approach.

Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.  I am available Monday, Wed, and Fri.

3235,"Thanks, Lamar.  The ARM coalition's attorney is drafting the comments, which should be ready for review later this morning.  The comments will deal exclusively with the rules governing the DA suspension and won't address the contracts issue--comments on Carl Wood's demand to see the contracts will come later in the week, or first thing next week.
 
With respect to the positions in the comments, it's a composite of the positions of many ESPs and their customers.  Appears that some ESPs in the ARM group may want to assign customers to another ESP, which is why those comments are there.  Also, some customers want to be classified as DA in perpetuity, irrespective of their contract terms--which is why renewal, or the ability to change to another ESP, will get a lot of play.  And as you know, UC is being very aggressive in our planning meetings about facility-adds.
 
We could file separately, but the combined push for 1) establishing liberal suspension rules and 2) keeping contracts out of the Commission's hands will come from other folks and is likely to be pretty strong.  Not sure that separate comments would get us any additional value.  Let us know what you think.
 
In addition, Carl Wood isn't very interested in balancing suspension rules with the need to review contracts.  He's taking a ""chain saw"" approach.  He claims that he wants to see the contracts in order to determine whether he can re-set the suspension date retroactive to July 1, which the rest of the Commission currently does not seem to support.  In short, he appears hell-bent on trying to get his hands on people's contracts.  At this point the industry seems pretty solidly united in its opposition to giving them to him.  
 
We're contacting the other Commissioners to determine whether Wood is out on his own on the contract issue--our sense at this point is that he may not have any support from other commissioners.  We'll let you know as soon as we find out.
 
I'll forward the draft ARM comments to you and Kevin later this AM.  If you have any other quesitons, let us know.
 
On the cost allocation issues, that's on a slightly slower track, but in the same forum.  Edison's position is the one they proposed to us in negotiations, which we rejected--1) all customers pay for Edison's undercollection (bundled and DA alike), 2) all customers pay for stranded DWR long-term contracts (bundled and DA alike).   The advice letters regarding implementation of the DA suspension don't offer any real detail on allocation and those issues will be hard-fought over during the first part of Q1.  That's the status thus far.  We'll know more on December 12th, when the Commission will hold another hearing on how it plans to address these issues over the next 60-90 days.
 
Best,
Jeff

Attached is the complaint that EES intends to file tomorrow against SCE related to the recoupment of our Negative CTC.  As you aware, after returning our customers to DA recently, our billing department was expecting that the past Negative CTCs would be returned to our customer's accounts - this has not happened nor after conversations with SCE will it occur.  

This complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds.  Primarily EES does not want to pay for Utility charges for our customers while an outstanding Negative CTC balance is due.

One key risk with filing this Complaint is that SCE may consolidate this case with the earlier Complaint that is currently on hold.  Probably not too big of a downside.

We will be paying the bills into the CPUC for holding until the resolution of the Complaint.

Any questions or issues please let me know.

I will work directly with Volume Management each month on the Harbor process as we have previously agreed.

3266,"Jeff:

EES controls 2 generation resources in CA:  Enron WInd and Badlands.  I have a bad feeling about how these 2 resources are being handled by EES.  Badlands calls regularly and tells real time their unit is going up and down and we do nothing to change any schedules.  We are probably passing this all through to EES through volume management, but I doubt EES is passing this through to the generator.  Enron WInd sure benefits from the fact that we are a net debtor to the ISO as 100% of their power is going into real time and the only reason they are getting anything is because of ENA's ISO financial position.  If this was not the case they would essentially have collected nothing since Dec. 2000.

As part of your effort to try clean up this situation add this to the list.  I would suggest you move these resources over to the services desk and have us manage these contracts on a go forward basis with respect to settlements scheduling etc..  Get me the contracts they have and I can tell you what they are worth.  Then EES can just assign the deals to us.  They should not be dealing with generators anyway.

Chris "
3267,"K/C/M:

I wanted to document the things that I hope you guys can make some progress on next week as I will be in Houston and won't be able to bug you personally:

1.  Arco - Kourtney to send Alicia a spreadsheet (use the one I started - attached, make a new one or send the carp report) indicating the bilateral and real time activity that resulted since March 30, and the ISO imbalance activity based on meter reads if possible).

2.  $150 payment issue - Kourtney to recalculate the January payments and enter annuities to true them up based on the $150 cap on an hourly basiis rather than for the day's average.  The generators will probably owe us $ as a result of this recalc.  And, send out spreadsheet documentation to support our January payments

3.  December recalc. - Murray to recalc the Dec. %.  Can this be done and send out payments/invocies for the new %?

4.  EPMI Policy on ISO payments - Chris S. will get with Tim B. next week to accept or modify my receommendation for handling ISO short pays by next week so we can begin sending out estimated invoices/payments.

I know you will miss me next week, but I am sure I will be in your thoughts.

Thanks!

3268,"K:

I wanted to document what just happened on receiving a dispatch instruction from the ISO for Harbor Cogen (harbgn_7_units).   At 12:20 we received a dispatch instruction from he ISO due to the Stage 1 emergency.  The request was for 1 MW from Tosco and 27 MW from Harbor.  

As you know, we are no longer the SC for Tosco and have sent you the required documentation.  Can you make sure the ISO has this in their system?

With respect to Harbor, we were running 60 MW and were inc'd 27, indicating a request for a total of 87 MW.  We already had an approved outage request from the ISO as indicated by the fax I sent you indicating that Harbor only had 80 MW available.  So, the ISO should only have been able to dispatch 20 MW.  

We initially declined the dispatch instruction from the ISO due to the errors the ISO made and the confusion it caused us.  We immediately ""hit the phones"" to clarify the facts and subsequently inc'd generation to 80 MW by 12:45.  Why did the ISO dispatch group not have our outage request indicating a maximum of 80 MW? 

We believe we have completely responded to the ISO's instruction and should have no penalty charges.  Please let me know the settlement implications of this confusion event.

Thanks

Chris
"
3269,"Jeff,

Based on what I have seen in the detail to this point.  The primary reason for the big hits have been due to what appears to be penalty charges associated to under scheduling.  When Enron De-DASR'ed all of the customers back to the utility in Jan.  EES was not including them in their schedule.  However, the customers were not yet physically moved back over to the utility until a later date.   

The title on this $40MM  has been Ancillary Services.  This is not a true representation of what is being discussed.  We are actually talking about all Market Transmission charges which have been allocated to EES based on their physical load.

The big hits in the months in question are more related to Neutrality/Penalty charges related to A/S.

At this point I have only spend about 1hr looking at the detail.  Chris Stokley will be working with the EES Retail Volume Management group and EPMI Volume Management group today to have them look into a couple of questions regarding detail.

We should have an update for everyone by Friday to let you know the primary reasons flash to actual variance and lateness of reporting.

As for when and what should be reported as a DPR adjustment.
When:  Jeff and Tim need to talk about when they want to see this hit.
What:   We have already disputed these periods with the ISO.  There will be no additional disputes on these settlements.  The only thing which may change to impact these $'s is the fact that the ISO is in the process of recalculating 10/00 - 6/01 and the Market rate will be less most likely when EES was short.  This should have a positive impact on what would be booked today.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Hope to have more to update you on by Friday. - MO

Everyone should have access to the Global application.  (Global Counterparty, Global Facility, Global Contracts, Global Common Codes).  You should be able to find them under your start menu (See below).

If for some reason you do not has access to all of them you will need to put in a security request, requesting them.  In addition to the production application you should also have access to the Test and REP Test applications for each.  (These test applications can be found through your start menu as well under Programs>Development application>Global>

Listing of current issues

Resaving and publishing of April 30th IM curves to show June values.  The portcalc's were bombing out because there was no prior June value in the curves.  So as of May 1, they started bombing.  I have to find a way to re-post prior day curves out into ERMS.  

All the GDI curve manager files that are pulling the physical index curves should be ready by tonight.  I'm doing Texas as I write.  I think we should leave the issue of who and how these curves are set up to the individual desks.  For the central desk, we can use the term traders files to publish.  But, we could also set aside a separate file to merely listen to the phys idx curves and publish them that way.  I'm going to release the files to the desks for them to review and get back to me for changes and revisions.  

The changes made into TDS deal evaluation are being revised today.  I guess there were some problems this morning and are now being fixed.

As for the position manager, there is an issue as to how we would like the New/ Changed/ New & Changed filter placed onto the position manager.  The issue there is that with the FX column in the positions tab, what should that positions tab look to as a filter if we place that function on the positions and cash tab.  Dave has suggested putting the filter in the menu area where you can manipulate it and then tab between columns.  I agreed that that was the best solution but I figure you should probably let me know ASAP whether you agree.

Other than that I don't know what else is new or important to add.  After I'm done calcing tonight I'll go ahead and publish the GDI curves myself.  Tomorrow morning I'll talk with the Risk leads and ask them if they can review and load the curves from here on out.  I'll also start modifying the curve files to include an additional month so we wont run into that problem again.  That should be done for EOD tomorrow.  Give me a call if you have any questions and/or problems.

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

3306,"What is the AOS? How does it work?
 The details have not yet been agreed.  TCPL is proposing AOS of 2.5% of firm 
entitlement that would be credited to an IT bill. This means you would have 
to have IT services in any month to access the credit but it is not limited 
to your FT path.  Some shippers are still insisting on a separate class of 
service on the FT nomination.  Due to system development constraints I expect 
either TCPL's proposal to go through or the whole concept is scrapped. 

IT Floor - how do you calculate the marginal fuel cost?
That is still to be worked out but TCPL's position is to publish an Empress 
to Parkway marginal fuel toll updated monthly for changes in Empress MI.

No ability to negotiate services or discount?
That is correct.  There is no appetite for negotiated services amongst the 
LDCs, CAPP and the larger producers.  Marketers and IPPs are much more 
receptive.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	Senate May Seal SoCal's Fate
?	SoCal Edison Eyeing Bankruptcy


California Senate & SoCal's Fate 
With the California Assembly's passage of SB 78XX last week, Senator John Burton (President Pro Tem) is positioned as perhaps the most legislatively powerful man in California.  Maintaining his hard line against the Assembly's amendments to SB78XX, Burton has completely rejected SB78 XX and has instead revived a previously introduced Assembly bill (AB 67XX), which had not faced a Senate floor vote.  The majority of AB 67XX's original language has been gutted by Burton and discretely replaced with the following points:

?	Financing of the dedicated rate component has been modified to incorporate a smaller rate base consisting of consumers using only 70 kv or more (formerly users as low as 20 kv were included).  The 70 kv value is rumored closer to 120 kv.
?	The state will have a 5-year option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets at twice book value and SoCal will be allowed to transfer profits from the sale to their parent company.
?	A renewables portfolio equal to 20% of total generation must be in place by 2010.  
?	There is an 11.6% return on generation in the bill.
?	The amount authorized for SoCal's bond issuance has been lowered from $2.9B to $2.5B.  
?	Direct access language has been included in the bailout bill.  The exact language, which was developed by Senator Bowen's office, is not yet known, however, earlier versions suggest that all parties will be forced to pay exit fees, switch providers no earlier than 2003, and there will be no cost shifting away from the DWR. (Note: Senator Burton is reportedly listening carefully to Treasurer Angelides' arguments about the revenue bonds not selling if direct access is included.)

It is doubtful that Burton will insist on the loyalty of fellow Democrats and will preferably discourage the bill's support.  The arrival of AB67 XX on the Senate floor may be little more than Burton's civil compliance with Gov. Davis' request.  All Republicans and at least 5 Democrats are expected to vote against the bill; an additional two dissenting Democrat votes would effectively block AB67 XX.  Consumer advocates that adamantly oppose this bill (because it lacks the state's ownership of hard transmission assets and burdens residential consumers with excessive rates) are ""optimistic"" about the bill's defeat in the Senate.  Despite these circumstances, it is highly conceivable that the Senate could pass along a virtually ineffective & inadequate bailout package for the Assembly's approval.

Burton is reportedly avoiding discourse with Davis over AB67 XX and as the hours pass ever closer to the midnight deadline, Burton will likely introduce the bill for floor vote and then hurriedly adjourn the Senate.  If the bill passes, the Assembly will bare the difficult task of either accepting the bill as is, or reject the bill and risk SoCal's bankruptcy.  We believe that if the bill makes it into the Assembly, AB67 XX will pass despite strong opposition from both the CTMA and consumer advocates.  There is no current vote count available in the Assembly, but we expect the Assembly to debate the bill into the early hours of Saturday morning. 

Inside Edison 
There are still strong indications that even if a bailout plan is passed, SoCal will voluntarily file for bankruptcy or a creditor, most likely a generator, will take them into bankruptcy.  SoCal remains concerned due to the number of contingent claims on their cash (by the DWR, etc.) and appear likely to try to protect these cash flows.  From the generators' perspective, if a plan is passed, the bank creditors will get paid but they will not.  Also, the DWR and ISO have not resolved even what amount is owed to generators for power they have provided this year, let alone when they will be paid.  The total amount owed through the ISO is approximately $2B.  Nonetheless, the generators remain under a federal order to provide power to the state.  Once a deal is passed leaving too little money for SoCal to pay the generators, this will leave them with little means of satisfaction other than filing against SoCal.

SoCal has privately indicated to Senators that if the AB 67XX fails to include any consumer using 100 kv or more as the base for the dedicated rate component, SoCal will be forced to file for bankruptcy because of their inability to effectively securitize the bailout bonds.  SoCal feels that this rate base is too small and the risk of these businesses fleeing the state is too high.  The CTMA also has indicated that some of its members may leave the state to avoid having to pay the extra surcharge on power.  

SoCal has not communicated a position on whether the $400 million trim (from the original $2.9B) puts them into bankruptcy. We estimate that an additional $400 million hit is indeed too much to bear and would prompt a voluntary bankruptcy petition. "

3342,"Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new 
version of deal entry into production, they tested one more time to make sure 
that the new fields were pulling into our scheduling reports. It was a 
precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only 
to find out that they wouldn't show up in the Enpower to CAPS report at the 
end of the day. Sorry for the confusion.

"
3344,"Questions about this deal - 

1. Should energy type be CAISO? 
2. Should trade date be 3/7?
3. Should confirmation status be ""NO""?

I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before 
changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals 
marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just 
a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the 
confirmation status.

Thanks,
Kate"
3345,"To re-cap:
I will talk to Will Smith in Houston IT about adding a function in Deal 
Blotter to choose confirm or no confirm. In the meantime, Houston Confirms 
group would greatly appreciate us changing these deals to no confirm. They 
will assume that all daily deals done with PGE are no confirm, but the deals 
will still show up on their report (and cause confirm group crankiness) if 
they are marked to be confirmed. Thanks for your help.

Val was looking into this deal, but now that she's gone I wonder if you could 
help me with it. It's a swap that was done on 10/18/99 between LTWM and EES. 
It's an off-peak deal for 0.2 mw at a price of $23.00 and settlement index of 
PX SP-15. There are five legs that each run for one year - Cal'05 through 
Cal'09. 

I understand you've been working on making the switch from PX to Dow Jones 
indices. Do you know anything about this deal and whether or not its index 
needs to be changed? Please let Melissa or me know.

"
3358,"Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Thanks,
Kate

3359,"Okay, that makes more sense. I've left a big note on Sean's desk and I'm

3405,"Attached is the FINAL Name Change/Merger report for March 2001.  Please note 
that the most recent overlays are on top because unlike the others, prior 
notification has not been given.  These were just done last night and this 
morning.  For the complete report, go to the bottom tab, ""March 2001"".

The shortname changes will be coordinated with ERMS IT today, Fri, 03/23/01.

Records will be inactivated on Mon, April 2, 2001.

FYI - On the Feb 2001 report, there were several PG&E entities that went 
through name changes to El Paso entities.  There were also 3 TECO 
conversions.  We did not have the documentation to support those changes, as 
noted on the report.  As of 03/22/01, all documentation for those changes are 
in hand.

Regarding the Coastal/El Paso merger, the documents that support name changes 
as a result of that merger, have been received.  If you are interested in 
more details regarding the remaining entities, they are attached below.

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

Please call if there are questions or concerns.

3406,"Hi Kate,

Thanks for the email.  Sorry it's taken me a while to respond but it's chaos
here as we prepare to head off for the next part of our trip today.  Glad to
hear the glow of the screen still has you enthralled.  Keep hitting F9 and
all will be well.  The bit when the screen flashes like a disco ball means
your pay is being cut.  I hope all those hideous applications I built that
you were using haven't blown sky high.  But you know I did put little bugs
in all of those things so that they would stop working about 4 months after
I left.  Sorry!  I neede to ensure there would be work for me to do when/if
I come back.

Your plans for a summer escape sound fun.  But what you should really do is
come out to Jackson with Elliot at the beginning of May.  We're planning a
debauched weekend here right after we finish a section of the trip.  Should
be fun.  Just the thing for relieving stress from staring at the screen.  By
the way, have you seen the movie Office Space?  I'd recommend it.

Please check that Elliot is actually working from time to time.  He does
this routine where he'll have a bunch of things up on his screen, but his
eyes are actually closed.  Whenever you see that, just throw something at
him.  Of call his phone and says it's Jeff Skilling.

Hope all is well in sunny Portland.  Keep me posted on any unseemly office
gossip.

Talk to you soon.

Stanley. He is a '96 graduate of Washington State University with a degree in 
Accounting and Finance.

Please welcome Craig to our Portland Office!"
3408,"See, I knew it!  You always assume the worst when really the reasoning was
kind of flattering - he thinks so highly of you that he doesn't want you to
see him upset.  I think that's a valid excuse, I'm totally the same way.
The other night I bagged on Nathan's dinner party, which I really wanted to
go to, because I was afraid I would start slurring my speech before my first
cocktail.  You know what that's like, to be working so hard that you don't
feel like yourself.  Anyway, I'm glad it all worked out!

Michelle and I went out with Monica, John, Amber, Marky and John's brother
Mark on Saturday night.  It was so insane.  First of all, I was already
exhausted and therefore drunk before we even left the first bar, regardless
of my 8am shift at Starbucks the next morning.  Then when we went to
Nathan's bar, Amber and Marky SKIPPED ahead, knocking the odd garbage can
over along the way.  So they got to the bar before me, and they found Nathan
because Monica told them he looked just like Chandler Bing, and Amber was
like ""Are you Anna's boyfriend?"".  Thanks.  He was really cool about it
though, even though I think it caught him off guard.  I had to explain to
him that I NEVER used the word boyfriend, but he said he was flattered so it
was cool.  We were such an odd group: Amber and Marky were dancing with no
equilibrium, Monica's boyfriend and brother sat in the corner and remained
mute, Michelle was telling Monica how she should really meet her bipolar
cousin.  I was sure after that night that I would never see Nathan again,
but yesterday he took me to THE CUTEST little french restaurant, and we had
wine and two courses and dessert.  It was so great!  And some of his friends
came and had a cocktail with us afterwards and he had his arm around me the
whole time.  He is SO GREAT!!!!  I don't know how accurate of a description
I am giving you, but I have never been so happy with a boy before.  He is
funny and cute and he loves wine and food.  Anyway, that's my deal.  Oh, and
Dad and Laura are not going to be here until tomorrow, but he called from
the Grand Canyon (I'm so jealous) and said my car is a ""beautiful"" champagne
colored Corolla.  I'm a little worried, but he said it's like new so I'm
sure it'll be great.

I think that on your next payday, you should put a bid on priceline.com for
a ticket here.  We would have so much fun!  Or you could even go through
mom's travel agent and buy your ticket really far in advance - she said it
was only about $200 if you do it that way.  Of course, the later you come,
the sunnier it will be.  Anyway, I REALLY want you to visit!  And Monica
does, too.

Okay, keep me updated on the Dave situation - he sounds like boyfriend
material.  You should call me soon! (303) 777-7132, in case you lost it.

Love, Anna

to someone in Houston - Holli thought it was you. Apparently Holli got a 
message from both you and me last week while at a WSPP conference, and called 
Jan to tell her to send the confirms out - so Jan sent them AGAIN. So if you 
still haven't seen those confirms come across your desk, then either someone 
else is receiving them or they're going to the wrong fax number. I've left a 
note for Jan King and hopefully we'll talk in the morning so I can find out 
more specifically where she's been sending the confirm letters. Sorry for all 
this confusion. We'll talk tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

3414,"Kim - 
I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please 
let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I 
still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. 
On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the 
following deals:

557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp?
552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?

And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so 
you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be 
confirmed.


Diana - 
I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General 
Electric, but before I change the following deals to ""no confirm"" I want to 
clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty.
 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, 
Montana System, etc.), do we confirm?
 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is 
Portland General System, do we confirm?
 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General 
System, do we confirm? 
I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals 
in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that 
I'm doing this right. Please let me know.

3430,"Netiquette.  What's that?  

Well, in case you didn't know, Netiquette is the proper use of e-mail.  
Because we all spend a large portion of our day communicating with customers, 
vendors and co-workers via e-mail, here are some tips to help you polish your 
e-mail skills and send you on your way to Netiquette success. 

Short & Sweet
Keep your messages concise and to the point.

Cluless In . . .
The subject line can be a couple of words or a short phrase that gives the 
reader a hint to the contents of your message.

ARE YOU ANGRY?
The use of UPPERCASE text is the equivalent of yelling in the world of 
e-mail.  Lower the case and, thus, your e-mail voice.

Are You Still Angry!!!??
Watch out for excessive punctuation like exclamation points.  If something is 
important, put it in words, not exclamation points.

We Can Become Too Attached
Think of your reader and, whenever possible, put your message in the body of 
the e-mail rather than in an attachment.

Does Everyone Need To Know?
Be careful when you send replies to ""all recipients"" of an e-mail.  Ask 
yourself if everyone really needs to see your response.  If not, you'll be 
using up disk space, cluttering inboxes and slowing the mail servers 
unnecessarily.

Spellcheck Is Your Friend
Like printed documents, e-mail deserves a review to assure that grammar and 
spelling are correct.

Privacy On The Net?
There is no such thing as private e-mail.  Never send anything by e-mail that 
you would not want to see on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper.  There 
are no security guarantees with electronic mail.

Eyes Only In Cyberspace
Avoid sending any confidential or sensitive information via e-mail.  
Remember, it's very easy for someone else to forward messages you considered 
confidential.  Even messages sent as ""Confidential"" can be copied.

Quick Tips -- Refine Your Skills
Long paragraphs are hard to read.  Break them up into smaller ones of two to 
three sentences.
The use of abbreviations should be minimal.
When sending e-mail outside Enron, keep it plain and simple.  That means no 
elaborate use of formatting tools, such as bold, indent, etc.
Your e-mail signature should be the same one you use on printed documents.
Address people in business e-mail the same way you normally would in person 
or in a letter (e.g., Bob: or Ms. Smith:)
Sarcasm is dangerous to use in e-mail.  Remember, e-mail does not convey 
emotions."

3440,"To all of you who are without the luxury of a dial tone this morning:

Qwest Communications is working on the malfunctioning phone circuit. We don't 
know when the service will be reinstated; but in the meantime you can reflect 
on what life was like before the darn thing was invented.

Bell, Alexander Graham 

                b. , March 3, 1847, Edinburgh
                d. Aug. 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova 
Scotia, Can.

                Scottish-born American audiologist best known as the inventor 
of
                the telephone (1876). For two generations his family had been
                recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech 
correction,
                with Alexander Melville Bell's Standard Elocutionist passing 
through
                nearly 200 editions in English. Young Bell and his two 
brothers were
                trained to continue the family profession. His early 
achievements on
                behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before 
his 30th
                birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training.

                Alexander (""Graham"" was not added until he was 11) was the
 second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds 
Bell. Apart
 from one year at a private school, two years at Edinburgh's Royal High 
School (from
 which he was graduated at 14), and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh
 University and at University College in London, Bell was largely family 
trained and
 self-taught. His first professional post was at Mr. Skinner's school in 
Elgin, County
 Moray, where he instructed the children in both music and elocution. In 1864 
he
 became a resident master in Elgin's Weston House Academy, where he conducted 
his
 first studies in sound. Appropriately, Bell had begun professionally as he 
would
 continue through life--as a teacher-scientist.

 In 1868 he became his father's assistant in London and assumed full charge 
while the
 senior Bell lectured in America. The shock of the sudden death of his older 
brother from
 tuberculosis, which had also struck down his younger brother, and the strain 
of his
 professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell. Concern for their 
only surviving
 son prompted the family's move to Canada in August 1870, where, after 
settling near
 Brantford, Ont., Bell's health rapidly improved.

 In 1871 Bell spent several weeks in Boston, lecturing and demonstrating the 
system of
 his father's Visible Speech, published in 1866, as a means of teaching 
speech to the
 deaf. Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of 
speech such
 as lips, tongue, and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate 
the sounds of
 speech in the usual way. Young A. Graham Bell, as he now preferred to be 
known,
 showed, using his father's system, that speech could be taught to the deaf. 
His
 astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture.

 Even while vacationing at his parents' home Bell continued his experiments 
with
 sound. In 1872 he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of 
the deaf,
 edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer, and continued to study and 
tutor; in 1873
 he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University.

 Never adept with his hands, Bell had the good fortune to discover and 
inspire Thomas
 Watson, a young repair mechanic and model maker, who assisted him 
enthusiastically
 in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity. Their long 
nightly
 sessions began to produce tangible results. The fathers of George Sanders 
and Mabel
 Hubbard, two deaf students whom he helped, were sufficiently impressed with 
the
 young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits. 
Nevertheless, during
 normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy 
schedule of
 professional demands. It is scarcely surprising that Bell's health again 
suffered. On
 April 6, 1875, he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph; but 
after another
 exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop, while 
maintaining his
 daily professional schedule, Bell had to return to his parents' home in 
Canada to
 recuperate. In September 1875 he began to write the specifications for the 
telephone.
 On March 7, 1876, the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent 
Number
 174,465 covering ""The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or 
other
 sounds telegraphically . . . by causing electrical undulations, similar in 
form to the
 vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds.""

 Within a year followed the commercial application and, a few months later, 
the first of
 hundreds of legal suits. Ironically, the telephone--until then all too often 
regarded as a
 joke and its creator-prophet as, at best, an eccentric--was the subject of 
the most
 involved patent litigation in history. The two most celebrated of the early 
actions were
 the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company
 successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph
 Company for patent infringement. The charges and accusations were especially 
painful
 to Bell's Scottish integrity, but the outcome of all the litigation, which 
persisted
 throughout the life of his patents, was that Bell's claims were upheld as 
the first to
 conceive and apply the undulatory current. In 1877 Bell married Mabel 
Hubbard, 10
 years his junior.

 The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone; indeed, in 
many ways
 it was a beginning. A resident of Washington, D.C., Bell continued his 
experiments in
 communication, which culminated in the invention of the 
photophone--transmission of
 sound on a beam of light; in medical research; and in techniques for 
teaching speech
 to the deaf.

 In 1880 France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize; and the 50,000 francs 
(roughly
 equivalent to U.S. $10,000) financed the Volta Laboratory, where, in 
association with
 Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin, Chichester A. Bell, Bell invented the
 Graphophone. Employing an engraving stylus, controllable speeds, and wax 
cylinders
 and disks, the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound 
recording. Bell's
 share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American 
Association to
 Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (since 1956 the Alexander Graham 
Bell
 Association for the Deaf ). May 8, 1893, was one of Bell's happiest days; his
 13-year-old prodigy, Helen Keller, participated in the ground-breaking 
ceremonies for
 the new Volta Bureau building--today an international information centre 
relating to
 the oral education of the deaf.

 In 1885 Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. There, in
 surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland, he established a 
summer
 home, Beinn Bhreagh, complete with research laboratories.

 In 1898 Bell succeeded his father-in-law as president of the National 
Geographic
 Society. Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures, he 
sought to
 promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was 
limited to
 a privileged few. Again he found the proper hands, Gilbert Grosvenor, his 
future
 son-in-law, who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational 
journal
 reaching millions throughout the world.

 As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the 
century, he
 experimented with giant man-carrying kites. Characteristically, Bell again 
found a
 group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories. Always an 
inspiration,
 Mabel Hubbard Bell, wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the 
group, soon
 founded the Aerial Experiment Association, the first research organization 
established
 and endowed by a woman. Deafness was no handicap to the wife of Professor 
Bell. At
 Beinn Bhreagh, Bell entered new subjects of investigation, such as sonar 
detection,
 solar distillation, the tetrahedron as a structural unit, and hydrofoil 
craft, one of which
 weighed more than 10,000 pounds and attained a speed record of 70 miles per 
hour
 in 1919.

 Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf, Bell never 
lingered on
 one project. His research interests centred on basic principles rather than 
on
 refinements. The most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows 
marginal
 memos and jottings, often totally unrelated to the subject at 
hand--reminders of
 questions and ideas he wanted to investigate. It was impossible for him to 
carry each
 of his creative ideas through to a practical end. Many of his conceptions 
are only today
 seeing fruition; indeed, some undoubtedly have yet to be developed. The 
range of his
 inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in 
his name
 alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the
 telephone and telegraph, 4 for the photophone, 1 for the phonograph, 5 for 
aerial
 vehicles, 4 for hydroairplanes, and 2 for a selenium cell.

 Until a few days before his death Bell continued to make entries in his 
journal. During
 his last dictation he was reassured with ""Don't hurry,"" to which he replied, 
""I have to."""

3442,"The Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different 
counterparties. The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data 
to ensure its accuracy. Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones 
daily index price. And that's the long and short of it. 

The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than 
that. For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an 
average of all the prices. It would be redundant for each counterparty to 
ALSO report their purchases from each other. Therefore, when calculating the 
Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT 
participants in the Dow Jones survey. Following is a simple example:

Participant List  NP-15 Purchases  NP-15 Sales  Reported NP-15 Purchases 
Reported NP-15 Sales
Sempra  Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250  Avista - $270   Sempra - $250
Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260      Duke - $260
Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270      Avista - $270

Now that's simple!

Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15 
and SP-15 delivery points. Deals with these counterparty names need to be 
excluded from the calculation of PURCHASES at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.

American Electric Power - Amerelecpo
Avista Energy - Avistaene
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing - Dukeenetra
El Paso Merchant Energy
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. - EPMI
Idaho Power Company - Idacorpene
PacifiCorp - PACE
Pacific Gas & Electric Company - PG&E
Powerex Corp. - PWX
Puget Sound Energy, Inc. - PSPL
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing (formerly Southern Company Energy Marketing) 
- SCEM
TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. - Transalt

So I've probably succeeded in confusing you even more, but please feel free 
to come bug me with questions. Good luck!

3443,"These deals have been changed - just thought I'd let you guys know, for

3444,"We'd like to create a daily and monthly trade volume report, similar to the 
EOL Report we currently use to track both online and brokered trades done in 
the Portland office each day. The EOL JF tab seems to track the same data we 
need for a daily volume report; however, it does not display the data in the 
form we need. 

Under the ""Sort By"" heading at the bottom of the report, there are two 
choices - ""Deal #"" and ""Desk."" As I run it now, the report displays megawatt 
volumes and total deals according to desk. We now need to display the data 
according to delivery point. 

Please call Cara Semperger or myself when you get a moment, and we can fill 
you in on all the parameters she's looking for in this report. From there I 
think it should be a pretty simple modification of the query.

Thanks in advance for your help on this.

3445,"I'm curious to know how my lack of recent correspondence translates to a 
neglect of my brainpower. If I didn't know better, I'd say that was a purely 
conceited statement. But, of course, being the buff brain-builder that I am, 
I know it's not.

So how are things ""down"" there in Seattle? I've been meaning to check in with 
you and Michael to make sure you didn't lose any limbs in the big Quake of 
'01. By the sounds of it you've been left with at least your digits and a 
little imagination, which isn't half bad compared to the poor capitol 
building in Olympia, whose crumbling edifice has turned into another of those 
perfunctory ""news"" stories begging the question, ""Just how much will I ever 
care?"" Last evening's t.v. news actually had the bad sense to show footage of 
city construction workers picking their noses atop the dome while a coiffed 
blonde anchorwoman alerted viewers to the ""urgency of the building's 
reconstruction"" due to its ""inability to be inhabited until 2003."" Is it just 
me, or do t.v. newspeople seem to act stupid on purpose?

Speaking of stupid, what exactly is walpurgis night? And the Pogues? I 
realize I'm showing my lack of culture here, but curiosity always overtakes 
my elegant facade sooner or later. Speaking of elegant, we're having another 
party! And Amber might actually show up for this one, being that it's purpose 
is to celebrate her birthday. First weekend in April, April 7 to be exact, 
we'll be the proud hostesses of a 25th birthday/costume party. I'd love for 
you and Michael to grace us with your presence, but it sounds like you'll be 
halfway across the globe by then. If plans change, and for your sake I 
certainly hope they don't, give us a call or just drop in on the 7th.

I've got to run - there are energy crises to be mitigated, you know. But drop 
me a message before you take off for wine country. And watch out for falling 
pieces of crumbling buildings.

3446,"Les Rawson has spoken with Doug Reiner at Willamette regarding this deal. 
They are in agreement now about the prices. Les said he usually has to 
explain the methodology a few times when he does deals with these guys, so 
it's nothing new. But in the future, Les said he'd prefer to contact the 
counterparty first to avoid confusion. His extension is 3924. You're also 
more than welcome to call me first and I'll track Les down. (I think I'm 
probably easier to get ahold of!) 

At any rate, I hope this clears it up. And if Willamette has any other 
questions, let me know.

doesn't work.




"
3455,"This is a follow-up to my e-mail sent June 23rd. We are gearing up to release 
the above referenced Product. 

Matt - I need a Sigma Factor please; there will be one Product Type for each 
of the 'flexible' scenario's (i) not less than three day, not less than 5 
day, not less than 10 day:

Country: USA
Commodity: US Nat Gas
UoM:  MMBtu
Product Type: Physical Index (Flexible)

We are close to a final draft f the Product Description that will hit the 
website. The laymans description of the Product is as follows:

Buyer and Seller exchange gas during the month of June 2000.

Seller receives 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool 
Index.

Buyer has the right to notify Seller of when Buyer wants to take delivery 
during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three forms: not 
less than 3-day delivery, not less than 5-day delivery, or not less than 
10-day delivery (depending on Product Type). The gas nominated for each such 
day would be between Zero and not greater than the percentage of the total 
300,000 MMBtu based on the number of days of 'flexibility' (i.e.; Buyer 
chooses 5 days for nomination, Seller would deliver not more than 20% of the 
300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%). Buyer pays 
TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.

While the product Description on the website accounts for both the month-long 
delivery to the Seller and the 'flexibility' of the Buyer, the product should 
be entered into the downstream processes, settled and confirmed as two 
different products. This is necessary in order to give us the protection 
against non-performance that the GTC's and master contracts support.

you tell us whether there are any counterparties that aren't signing this 
type of confirm?  Because collateral is involved, from a legal standpoint, 
the only way that we may be able to enforce our rights vis a vis the

3465,"Interesting damage reports - particularly from St. Croix.  I had been looking 
at the cruising guide when I got home last night to see where we might be 
able to poke around in the USVI.  I seem to remember that the Moorings won't 
let us take the boat to St. Croix (a bit far away) but had thought we might 
want to get special permission.  Now I'm not so sure if the place will still 
be all ahoo when we get there.  It might not have been the entire group's cup 
of tea in any event since it would take a good solid day of sailing each way 
to and from St. John.  My impression is that I might be the only soul on 
board who would relish that thought - particularly if the seas are still a 
bit rough from storm effects.  I'm watching the national Weather Service 
updates as they come out - roughly every two hours.

Caution on the Fed Ex package for the doorman - USVI may be the US for INS 
purposes but not for Fed Ex - they require an international waybill for 
deliveries there.  You can have the package sent to their Cruz Bay office to 
be held for pick-up (two day service - guaranteed by 4 pm) or to St. Thomas 
airport (next day service by 2 pm).  I mentioned in a previous note that the 
main harbor in St. Thomas is not really yacht friendly but we could probably 
figure out a way to get in there if that works out best (maybe go into a 
different bay, dinghy ashore and get a cab to the airport).  Fed Ex - (800)

3477,"Bryan/Tim - Please pass this note on to your teams.  Thanks.

Please note the new procedures set out below which have been agreed with 
Credit and Credit Trading and take effect immediately.

1.  Use of Enron Credit Ratings

ERatings can be used freely in pricing credit protection for reference 
entities where the ERating does not contain ""confidential information"" (this 
is defined in the Credit Trading Group's existing confidentiality/Chinese 
Walls procedures - please consult with Legal if the meaning of confidential 
information is unclear in a particular case). 

If the ERating does or may contain confidential information (which Credit 
Risk Management will flag in each case) then the rating can only be used with 
the prior authorisation of the Legal Department.  By way of general guidance, 
authorisation will not be granted where this would result in a clear breach 
of a confidentiality undertaking given by Enron, or where the reference 
entity is privately owned and there is little or no publicly available credit 
information about it.

2.  Restricted List Procedure 

The Restricted List is reviewed and, if necessary, updated by Legal at least 
once a fortnight.

The Restricted List is ""unpublished"", which means that the only person 
outside Legal who may see it is Bryan Seyfried.

Before a credit price for any new reference entity is published outside 
Enron, Bryan will check that that name does not appear on the Restricted 
List.  If it does, the price may not be published.

If you have any questions please contact myself or Michael Brown.

Best regards

Paul

In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration 
in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to 
judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the 
jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in 
civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts 
generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap 
agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK 
agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts 
(where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our 
policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I 
would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely 
enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.

As we discussed, our attorney, Gerald Nemec, will incorporate your language from the red-lined Assignment Agreement in an amendment to the existing letter agreement between ENA and Patina.  The amendment to the letter agreement should be completed this afternoon, at which time Gerald will e-mail you a copy for review.

Subject: smurfit stone

Tracy,

Smurfit is trying to do one of two things and maybe a combination of the 
two.  They want to buy Cal 01 & 02 (Mid-c) for $100 flat.  Right now, prices 
are about $144.  They are also considering shuting down their plant, similar 
to Kaiser, and selling us their power contract back for Cal 01- prices right 
now are about $170.  This would book out our previous sale to them for cal 
01.   I am not familiar with their contracts or credit.  If they do 
something, they might want to do it today.  What do I need to do to be 
prepared to transact. And how do I find out about their contracts?

Thanks for your help.

Kim

 "
3509,"Dan, thanks for your help on this. I've forwarded the latest to John Ulrich
for signature.  In case I forget, please remind me to send you a certified
copy of the resolution.  I know it's been signed by all, including the

or concerns, please contact Mark Baldwin of Interstate Gas Services at

Kim-
Here is the August spreadsheet.  These are the changes I've made so far:

I changed the formula in column R
I added in the new contracts for August

The differences between my model and the invoice are the way that they calculate the actual gas flow to Malin (column L on mine and column Z on theirs);

It also appears that they do not include the Redwood credit.

Looking at my model now, I also don't remember what the calculation in column D is for.  It seems kind of unnecessary to me and doesn't make much sense.

I know this is a lot of stuff to look at.  If you don't understand what I just wrote, ask me and I'll explain what I'm trying to say.
Thanks,
Mara"

=09I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order,=
 please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signatur=

Please review the language under B of Contract Price of the Transaction Agreement to see if it isn't sufficient to cover the concept under item 8 of Pasadena Usage under your term sheet.  Likewise, I have added item C under El Paso Capacity to cover the sale of 1456 MMBtu/d.  Please check the language to ascertain that everything is covered.  Have a good weekend.  I will be in all next week if we need to further tweak the language."

An at the money Daily call option (against first of the month index) for gas at San Juan is $.24 for Q3 next year.  At the money monthly call options would be $.58 with a strike of $3.10.  A fixed price daily call option would be $.60 with a strike of $3.10.
