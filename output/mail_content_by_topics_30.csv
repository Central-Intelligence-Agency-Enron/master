3,"Reagan,

I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on 
Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned 
I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get 
back in touch with you once he is finished.

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager 
from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable 
with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp 
Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid 
for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am 
still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local 
relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final 
determination on unit mix and site plan.

COMMISSIONERS, REMEMBER TO SET YOUR PLAYOFF MATCHUPS

When your league's regular season ends, the site will not
generate your playoff schedule automatically. The
commissioner must set the playoff matchups manually by
accessing the Schedule, Matchups toolbar link in the Front
Office, choosing the week the playoffs begin and then
entering the matchups. Nothing else needs to be changed.
Once the commissioner enters the matchups, all owners can
view them on the Schedule, Playoffs page.


CONSOLATION MATCHUPS DURING PLAYOFF WEEKS

The fantasy playoffs are upon us. So why leave the
non-playoff teams on the sidelines? Commissioners can set
not only the playoff matchups, but consolation matchups as
well, under the Schedule, Matchups link in the Front
Office.


PLAYOFF INFORMATION

Go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoff
tournament starts and how many rounds it lasts. If you were
lucky "" make that skillful "" enough to make the playoffs,
go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams
with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which
players will be available for you.

WE'LL GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE PLAYOFFS

The playoffs are here and the pressure is on. You'll need
all the information you can get to stay competitive, and
stay ""alive"" in the playoff race. You can rely on us for
updated injury news and ""insider information"" on a daily
basis. All this can be found on your league's web site. Go
to News, NFL News and monitor the page each day as new
articles are constantly added. Regular features include a

PLAYOFF PREDICTIONS FROM OUR FANTASY ""GURU""

Take a break from pre-game trash talking and let our ""guru""
have a say. Go to Schedule, CommGuru for a ""tale of the
tape,"" comparing your starters to your opponent's, position
by position. The ""guru"" will predict the winner of the
matchup and a final score. In addition to adding spice to
your trash talking, it could also help you decide who to
start and who to bench. Tweak your lineup and go back to
see if the guru's prediction changes. If so, you may want
to consider changing your lineup accordingly. Of course,
the guru isn't perfect, but he can help you with those
tough decisions.


CUSTOMIZE YOUR REPORT SETTINGS

Did you know you can customize the settings of most
reports on the site, and save those settings so they are
displayed each time you visit the report? For example,
suppose you'd like the Transactions, View report to display
only Add/Drops over the past 7 days for all teams. Enter
those settings, click GO and then click the ""save"" icon
displayed over the report. Now each time you go to
Transactions, View, the report is displayed according to
your custom settings.

Anyway - I am definitely new in this town as far as I am concerned. So - I don't want to burden you with spending any time with my sorry ass - but to the extent that you want to grab your girlfriend and a friend of hers - I would always be willing to venture out.

From the Jerry DiPaola article:   Steelers running back Jerome Bettis missed
practice Wednesday, and later said he might not need to play in the final
two regular-season games to be ready for the first playoff game Jan. 19 or
20.

Bettis has missed the past three games with a serious groin injury that he
described to David Letterman last week as ""like splitting your pants, but
you're splitting your body.""

""Do you need to (play)? Need is a strong word,"" Bettis said yesterday after
watching his teammates practice. ""Would you like to get a little work in?
Just a little bit, nothing strenuous. But you would like to get a little
work in if you could.

""But if you can't, I don't think it precludes you from playing (in the
playoffs).""

Bettis said that he didn't know if he would practice today or play Sunday in
Cincinnati, but he will base his availability on how he feels.

""You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing,
that means not playing,"" he said. ""But you want to make sure you're healed
up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to
get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely.

""What I do know is if you don't play, there is going to be a certain amount
of rust associated with not having played. The key is to minimize the rust.
This is nine years in. I'm not going to miss much.""

************  Our View  ****************

Pretty much sums it up right there.   Clearly, Bettis is a large risk here.
Stay tuned to see how he progresses but even if he were to start, there's
always that very real risk that he'd pull himself out if he felt a twinge.

Thanks to Footballguy Greg Lizotte for pointing me to this one.

52,"Dear Investor,

I guess you've been too busy to respond to my
invitation so far.  And that's a shame.

I've written several times, demonstrating the safest
way to make BIG PROFITS in this market.  I've offered
to let you try my investment advisory RISK-FREE.  And
most importantly, I've shown you exactly how my
clients and I are making a ton of money right now.

Sadly, you've missed out on some really nice gains --
but I'm hoping you'll join us before you miss any
more:

*Our Forest Labs recently hit its all-time high.  And
today -- after a slight pullback -- this generic drug-
maker has RISEN 62% since late March.  That's just
what the doctor ordered!

*I've been pounding the table about Peoplesoft  for
months now.  It's up a STUNNING 103% since mid-
September!  That's the kind of big SHORT-TERM profits
I love best.

*You want to see strong growth in retail?  Check out
Best Buy.  The company is grabbing market share and
pumping up the profits -- in fact, it ""beat the
street"" again this quarter.  Wall Street LOVES a
winner.  The stock SOARED 151% in 2001!

*Conservative General Mills smashed through its all-
time high.  Why?  GREAT EARNINGS.  On December 20th --
the day after reporting earnings -- this stock closed
UP 19% in 2-months' time.

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we
own at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just
strong earnings growth.  The stock POPPED 109% in
2001!

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in
times like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually
recession-proof business.  That's why it rose a nice,
stomach-calming 32% for the year.

*What recession?  Chopper king Harley Davidson is
hogging all the profits.  The company announced chart-
topping earnings after-the-bell on October 9th, and
its stock is UP 27% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED
362% since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because
it's one of very few tech stocks that's still an
EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth.  And those are the sort
of profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in
the EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late
1997, our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-
to-1, thanks to our commitment to earnings quality.
And the advisory I started in the mid-1980s, MPT
Review, has GAINED 3,850% in the last sixteen years,
according to The Hulbert Financial Digest.

HERE'S THE KEY: I'm a very fickle guy.  As long as a
company keeps performing, I love it...things start
looking iffy, I take the profits and run.

We DUMPED EMC in the year 2000 and pocketed 466%
gains.  We BANKED 189% GAINS from Home Depot; 121% in
Microsoft; 179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 196% in
Vodafone Airtouch; and 316% in Nokia.  156% in Lucent;
201% in Cisco.  All stocks we SOLD before they soured.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they fell.  That's
why I urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip
Growth.  It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR
PROFITS -- in any kind of market.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

Find out by trying my Blue Chip Growth advisory RISK-
FREE.  You'll make money -- or it won't cost you a
dime.  I'll give you six months to try the service
risk-free -- set the bar as high as you want.  Sign up
now.  I'll introduce you to the EARNINGS MONSTERS that
are your best bet for 50% gains -- or more -- over the
next 6 months.  Go here now:

Sincerely,

Louis Navellier
Blue Chip Growth

P.S. I just added a new stock to my MUST-BUY list of
earnings monsters.  Actually, it's not entirely new --
it's an old favorite that rewarded us with 320% GAINS
last time around.  That was sweet! Now business is
booming again for this tech juggernaut, and it's time
to pile back in for our next round of  BIG fortune-
building gains.  Don't miss out this time.  Click here

53,"Wendy's Founder Dave Thomas Dies
By MARK WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Dave Thomas, the portly pitchman whose homespun
ads built Wendy's Old-Fashioned Hamburgers into one of the world's most
successful fast-food enterprises, has died. He was 69.
Thomas died around midnight at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the
company said Tuesday.
The cause of death was not given. Thomas had been undergoing kidney
dialysis since early 2001 and had quadruple heart bypass surgery in
December 1996.
Company officials were meeting at Wendy's headquarters in the Columbus
suburb of Dublin and planned an announcement later Tuesday.
The founder and senior chairman of Wendy's International became a
household name when he began pitching his burgers and fries in
television commercials in 1989. The smiling Thomas, always wearing a
white short-sleeved shirt and red tie, touted the virtues of fast-food
in humorous ads, sometimes featuring stars such as bluesman B.B. King
and soap opera queen Susan Lucci.
``As long as it works, I'll continue to do the commercials,'' Thomas
said in a 1991 interview. ``When it's not working any longer, then I'm
history.''
But burgers weren't his first love. Thomas, who was adopted as an
infant, became a national advocate for adoption.
He created the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, a not-for-profit
organization focused on raising public awareness of adoption. The
profits from his books, ``Dave's Way'' and ``Well Done!'' go to the
foundation.
He once testified before a Congressional committee about the importance
of creating incentives for adoption.
``I know firsthand how important it is for every child to have a home
and loving family,'' he testified. ``Without a family, I would not be
where I am today.''
Born July 2, 1932, Thomas was 12 when he got his first job - delivering
groceries in Knoxville, Tenn. He joined the restaurant business in the
1950s.
While working at a barbecue restaurant in Fort Wayne, Ind., he met KFC
founder Col. Harland Sanders, who became a major influence.
Thomas came to Columbus in 1962 to take over four failing KFC
restaurants for his boss, who promised Thomas a 45 percent stake in them
if he turned them around. Sanders sold the restaurants back to KFC for
$1.5 million in 1968, making Thomas a millionaire at 35.
He opened his first Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers in Columbus a year
later. He named the restaurant after his 8-year-old daughter Melinda
Lou, nicknamed Wendy by her siblings.
The chain grew to 4,800 restaurants in the United States and 34
countries by 1996. That year, Wendy's acquired the 1,200-store,
Canadian-based Tim Hortons chain of coffee and fresh-baked goods.
Thomas was a forgiving businessman.
The city of Philadelphia in 1994 wanted to fine Wendy's $98,400,
claiming the restaurant was selling quarter-pounders that were up to a
quarter of an ounce short. The city later announced it made an error and
withdrew the fine.
``I understand what happened,'' said Thomas, who visited the city
shortly after the controversy. ``Things happen. Mistakes happen. As far
as we're concerned, we just want to go to the future. A bright future.''

He tried to retire in 1982, but came back in 1989.
``They took the focus off the consumer,'' he said of the executives who
took over the company.
It was the TV commercials that made Thomas famous. Industry analysts and
company officials said the ads helped the company rebound from a
difficult period in the mid-1980s when earnings sank. In 1996, Thomas
taped his 500th commercial. Rotund at first, he appeared slimmer in the
ads in recent years.
``He's given Wendy's a corporate identity ... a down-homey type image.
The lack of sophistication is a real benefit for the company,'' Diane
Mustain, a financial analyst, said in 1991.
Despite his success, it wasn't until 1993 that he earned a high school
equivalency certificate.
That year, he told 2,500 Columbus public school seniors his biggest
mistake was not finishing high school.
``We have 4,000 restaurants today, but if I had gotten my high school
diploma, we might have 8,000,'' he said.","Dave Thomas MARK WILLIAMS Thomas B.B. King

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

I am still a little out of it from my travels, but let me take a first shot 
at my reaction to this:
 I think we ought to at least challenge the notion that the mark-to-market 
exposure is so arcane as to be dismissed.  Generally, time is of the essence 
in most contractual relationships and the value of that time should take into 
account both time value of money and the value of the underlying at critical 
times.  
 I think that RAC should be deeply involved in setting negotiating strategy 
and be part of any decisions made.
I will add to this if and when the haze clears up.

I am writing to you to express my interest in working for Enron.  I have
long been interested in a career in business, and I would love the
opportunity to explore business in Enron this summer.

As I have worked with the Harvard Entrepreneurs Club (HEC) and various
entrepreneurs association around the country to spearhead the effort to
form a national collegiate entrepreneurs organization, I have learned a
great deal about how organizations work and how to make them effective.
This theme of entrepreneurship has spilled over into my other activities as
well.  I am coordinating the first annual fundraising banquet for Christian
Impact to help us raise money for outreach events.  I am also co-leading
the first mission trip comprised of Harvard students this summer.  Because
this effort is taking me to Latin America for the first half of the summer,
I will be in Houston from mid-July to mid-September.  If there is a
position available at Enron, I would enjoy working for it while I am here.

I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the business world.
The combination of resourcefulness, rigorous logic, and creativity called
for in the business sphere intrigues me.  The integration of global and
analytical thinking also piques my interest. I have attached my resume for
you to review, I will be in Houston from March 27-31 if you would like to
interview me. Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing
from you!

90,"Along with Mike McConnell, I am active in recruiting for Enron's Analyst 
Program at the University of Oklahoma.  We became involved in recruiting 
there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program 
that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.  OU transformed 
their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management 
Program in the School of Business.  This undergraduate degree retains the 
geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM 
program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a 
trading floor course.  With the added plus of many of these students growing 
up in or around ""energy"" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that 
recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron.  Our 
recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy 
Management graduates have done well at Enron.  

Our first hire from OU (and the top Energy Management student) was Jody 
Crook.  He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 
graduation.  His first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book 
administrator in gas trading.  He is in the process of looking for a second 
rotation at the end of February, and I think that he is someone that you 
should consider for a rotation on your team.  In addition to this last year's 
risk experience at Enron, Jody worked as a landman for two summers for 
Burlington Resources.  

I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron.  I think very highly of him, 
and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program.  
His background and your business seem to be a good fit.  Please visit with 
Jody as he contacts your group about a rotation.  It will be well worth your 
time.  

Thanks.

96,"The major groups are :

Manage Risk
Deal Clearing & Documentation
Logistics
Volume Management
Client Services or Settlements
Global Data Management


Within each of these major areas there groups of activities.  I have some 
charts I can provide to you (they are slightly dated, but still better than 
not).  To give you an idea, 

Manage Risk is comprised of :  Value books, Identify Limit violations, Flash 
P&L, Trade Capture, Generate Reports, etc.
Deal Clearing is comprised of: Prepare and distribute confirmations, 
verify/audit deals, broker checkout, etc.
Logistics is comprised of:  gather operational data, communicate with 
pipelines, plan product movement, nominate product movement, balance 
positions, etc.
Volume Management : validate transport statements, allocate volumes, 
reconcile imbalances, etc.
Client Services - Prepare and generate invoices, generate payment requests, 
resolve disputes on billing, cash management, reconcile A/R and A/P, etc
Global Data Management - set up new counterparties, maintain cp data, capture 
and validate settled prices, setup new pipelines and facilities, etc.

Generally, what is thought of as Financial Reporting at Enron is outside of 
Back Office Operations as is any trading or origination activity.

we are focusing on the Elba Island transaction, however, the LNG team has 
requested information concerning an accrual book to accurately capture the 
risks associated with their LNG Vessel ""Mystic Lady"" as well as an additional 
vessel they are looking to acquire.

Eric Groves has built a curve generating model that will facilitate the risk 
books and/or any exotic option models that may be necessary.   As of Friday, 
we have not received the information needed to capture all of the FOB and 
Delivered Curves.  We have been in contact with Enron LNG and they will be 
forwarding this information.  We are expecting to sit down with the LNG 
commercial team late next week to obtain assumptions such as product sourcing 
locations and the timing of anticipated spot cargoes for delivery to Elba 
Island.

Once we receive the additional information for the curves and the sourcing 
assumptions, we will be in a position to sit down with the research group and 
determine the most appropriate means of valuing these transactions.  We are 
also working with the Europe Engineering group as a source of validating some 
of the information that we have received.

As a vision statement this looks like an excellent place to start. You might

interviewers at this time.

2.  For the first weekend - Oct. 28th - To date, I don't see that anyone from 
your area has signed up to interview.  This may be because this is an 
Associate weekend.

3.  For the second weekend - Nov. 4th - The only person signed up is Pat 
Clynes from Logistics.  The second weekend is really large and we still need 
about 67 interviewers.  We are looking for Managers and above to interview.

132,"Hello guys, first of all thanks all of you for your great help and specially 
lately since volumes in Mexico are really picking up....
I am sending you the list of pending To Dos with our counterparties in 
Mexico...Hopefully with your help, we can start shrinking this list...
Thanks also for your time yesterday, and I think it was great to put all 
these items together and have a specific plan of attack for the upcoming 
weeks.
I propose that we get together next week to follow up on this list of pending 
items and evaluate if it is shrinking or not. 
Kind regards. 





Bill, Mark, Sally  and Max as you all know, the volumes of trades going on in 
Mexico, are increasing very rapidly.  Today, we are doing transactions with 
around 50 different counterparties, and have passed the 55 Bcfs of gas mark, 
while we are trying to put Master Agreements in place, and also working very 
intensively with Credit setting up and evaluating many companies that are not 
public.  The Mexican market is "" In diapers"" in terms of risk management, and 
we are trying very hard to open it up, create awareness, and bring volumes to 
Enron. 

As of last September, Enron was the second largest energy risk management 
trading company in Mexico, second to the state monopoly Pemex.  Today, we can 
tell that our volumes are 250% larger than those in september and most 
probably we are by now the leading risk management company in our country.  
Moreover, for many of our customers, these have been their first transactions 
and because of that we need to make an extra effort to ensure that the day to 
day operations run as smoothly as we can. 

I am sending you a copy of what we have to work on, so that you are in the 
loop, and are aware of the resources that this market is demanding us right 
now.

Thanks for your support and I'll keep you posted.

Thanks for the voice-mail.  While we have selected a date, it is not cast in 
stone.  If there is another date that works better and would allow more of 
the individuals to participate, that is fine with me.  I just want to make 
sure that the Program is being responsive.  Incidentally, I did not realize 
that Rick would be out of town, so it is no problem to change the date.

You indicated that you would be willing to provide a few bullet points 
regarding the issues you and the group would like for us to address.  That 
would be great.  Please forward those at your earliest convenience.   

I will assume that you will notify the other individuals of the date and time 
of the meeting, Wednesday, April 19th at 10:00 a.m.   If this assumption is 
not correct please provide the names of the other individuals who will attend

137,"Rick:

Just want to provide a summary of our discussion on Wednesday, 4/19/2000 
regarding the analyst program and the conclusions reached.

Discussion item #1:  Similarities and differences between the commercial and 
commercial services analyst position.  Concluded that the only difference 
between the two analyst profiles is the difference in merit and bonus 
compensation.  Both have the opportunity to rotate across commercial and 
commercial services areas, return to business school after two years, stay 
and be promoted either to a commercial services professional position or take 
a commercial route and ultimately be promoted to associate.

Agreed:  There is one analyst program and we will immediately eliminate the 
compensation differences.  All analysts will receive the same 5K yearly merit 
increase and be eligible for the commercial bonus range.

Discussion item #2:  Morale of analysts in program.  Due largely to 
compensation differences making the program feel as though it is still two 
separate programs.  Commercial services needs more attention and focus.  Need 
someone of a Celeste Roberts calibre to focus on the staffing piece.

Agreed:  Eliminating the compensation differences will help boost morale.  
Additionally, there needs to be more focus and attention paid to the career 
development of analysts.  

Discussion item #3:  UT Spring recruiting.  Did not feel there were enough 
events and concerned that executive leads were not asked to participate.

Agreed:  Celeste Roberts will follow-up with George Hope and Shelly Jones to 
confirm number of events and whether dates were booked on executive lead's 
calendars.  Bottom line, we want to ensure that presence on campus is not 
minimized.

Discussion item #4:  Off-line discussion with Sally Beck regarding the 
Performance Review Process and whether all analysts would be reviewed as one 
pool

Agreed:   Per Sally Beck it was agreed that all analysts would be reviewed 
together.  We will not separate commercial from commercial services but will 
put all analysts on the table and review as one analyst pool.

 Please let me know if there are additional items that need to be captured.

It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.

I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with 
our banking.  Enron Online does not interface with the banking.  It 
interfaces with a trading system/accounting system?  What I need to know is 
what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading.  The 
accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.

What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local 
Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the

interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need

161,"This is the response I put together for Louise.



This may be better done in person.  If so, give me a call when you have time.

Here is my vision of the two worlds - Enron and Commodity Logic.



There are two basic alternatives:

If you see Commodity Logic as an independent venture, then we should build-in 
independence in our communication of deal data.  The ""Transaction Store"" does 
this.  Beth's DriveTrain project being led by John Simmons will provide 
this.  In this model, not every function/system currently performed will be 
supplanted by a Commodity Logic module.  Complete reliance on Commodity Logic 
to provide deal data needed for these systems would certainly complicate the 
integration as Commodity Logic may reside outside the firewall.   The 
systems/functions we don't think we'll outsource to Commodity Logic are: 
Trade Capture, Contracts, Valuation, Credit, and SAP functions.  
Additionally, we would like to see the development of more reporting support 
for the DPR, Operations Pricing Model, EnTelligence, and SAP Warehouse data; 
the implementation of a workflow, issue-tracking tool; and an Enron-branded 
site for Customer Information.   This vision was arrived at by asking the 
question: ""What would you never consider outsourcing, either due to 
competitive advantage, control issues, or confidentiality?""
I started shopping this vision around last week and will continue to do so 
this week to get feedback for finalization.

If the two are really one and will be managed as one going forward, then 
certainly a single deal database could suffice.  In this case, there should 
not be separately managed IT functions as redundant development efforts may 
occur and we could focus the resources on the top priorities.  Right now, 
Commodity Logic is heavily dependent upon Beth's resources to provide the 
data from the legacy systems.  The work to do these data feeds competes with 
other priorities currently underway such as Unify Performance, Alberta Open 
Access for Power, etc.  I think it is important to note that we have two 
different requirements for deal data.  One - to support Commodity Logic 
functions - is transactional and near-realtime in nature.  The second - to 
support reporting functions is probably a batch end of day process.  The 
technical design of the two would be different to meet functional and 
performance requirements.  So, in a combined world, there would still 
probably be two sources of deal data, one present on our network as separate 
messages for each deal that transactional systems build a listener to 
subscribe to and  a second source in a warehouse for reporting.

Either alternative can be approached, however organizational alignment and 
priorities might be different.  Further, if the intent is to break Commodity 
Logic off into a separate entity, then the first alternative is preferred to 
maintain arms-length independence. 

Another alternative is to consider Operations and Commodity Logic as a 
combined entity that is separate from Enron that offers systems and 
back-office services to Enron and other industry players.  I think this may 
be what Sally is envisioning.  If this is where we are headed, then some of 
Beth's resources that are directly tied to support of Operations' systems 
should be combined with Commodity Logic resources so we can have a focus on 
coordinated priorities.  I believe this alternative has the same issues as 
the first in terms of what is outsourced, e.g. becomes part of Commodity 
Logic, and what remains proprietary and confidential to Enron.

Let me know your thoughts.

187,"Along with Mike McConnell, I am active in recruiting for Enron's Analyst 
Program at the University of Oklahoma.  We became involved in recruiting 
there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program 
that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.  OU transformed 
their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management 
Program in the School of Business.  This undergraduate degree retains the 
geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM 
program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a 
trading floor course.  With the added plus of many of these students growing 
up in or around ""energy"" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that 
recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron.  Our 
recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy 
Management graduates have done well at Enron.  

Our first hire from OU (and the top Energy Management student) was Jody 
Crook.  He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 
graduation.  His first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book 
administrator in gas trading.  He is in the process of looking for a second 
rotation at the end of February, and I think that he is someone that you 
should consider for a rotation on your team.  In addition to this last year's 
risk experience at Enron, Jody worked as a landman for two summers for 
Burlington Resources.  

I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron.  I think very highly of him, 
and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program.  
His background and your business seem to be a good fit.  Please visit with 
Jody as he contacts your group about a rotation.  It will be well worth your 
time.

Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors.
Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland.
EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method.

Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts.

Treo Talk
Last time, we talked about how the new Treo? communicator <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3278.233.34125625> lets you stay in touch when you just can't talk on the phone. This week we'll look at how it lets you surf the web-without wires.

	
Bandwidth on the Run
For most people the experience of ""surfing the web"" wirelessly has been more akin to wading in the shallow end of a pool. Even when you're able to access one of the select few websites that have been optimized for WAP (wireless application protocol), tiny mobile phone screens often mean endlessly scrolling through blocks of text one small line at a time. The Treo communicator changes all that.	
  <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	
The Treo communicator comes loaded with Blazer? 2.0 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3279.233.34125625>, the latest version of Handspring's award-winning web browser for the Palm OS
. Blazer lets you securely view virtually any HTML, cHTML or WAP web site in its entirety-with full text and graphics formatted to look great on your Treo screen. So the content you see on your Treo communicator is the same as what you would find on your desktop computer. Plus, you can bookmark up to fifty sites, so the information you want the most is always at your fingertips.	   <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3280.233.34125625>

Take movie listings, news headlines,and shopping deals with you, on-the-go. <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3280.233.34125625>	 
  <http://4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	
Even if you've never accessed the web from a mobile device before, Treo makes it easy to see why you would want to. Imagine having instant access to a map when you get lost on the road. Or checking a stock quote during a power lunch. Or reading the top headlines on your way to work. Or buying movie tickets on the way to the theater. The Treo communicator lets you do all this and so much more-wherever you are.

The Word Is Out
Want to hear what others have to say about Treo? Here's a small sampling of some of the buzz <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3281.233.34125625> that this amazing product has generated so far.

Tips & Tricks
Cutting out just a few little steps now can save you heaps of time in the long run.

	
Customize Your Synchronization
You can shave time off your HotSync operation by only synchronizing the programs you actually use. Don't use the Expense application? Never read your email on the road? Don't waste precious synchronization time. Just open the Palm Desktop, choose the HotSync drop-down menu, and click Custom. You'll get a list of all the applications that synchronize. Simply change the ones you no longer need from Synchronize the files to Do Nothing and you're ready to start saving time!

Set Time Dialogue Box
When you're setting the time of an event with the Set Time dialogue box, you don't have to navigate up and down the vertical hour and minute bars. You can just tap the Start Time or End Time box and use your Graffiti pad to enter the times.

Write Stuff
With over 11,000 Palm OS applications just waiting to be downloaded, there's literally no end to the ways you can use your Visor handheld. Find out how reader Matthew S. used his to calculate complex traffic problems for Calgary's Transportation Department.

Visor Gets the Green Light

This summer I had the privilege of working for the Transportation Department of the City of Calgary here in Calgary, Canada. One of the projects I aided was a study into the start-up delays of vehicles once the traffic light turns green. There can be as much as a five second delay between when the light turns green and the rear axel of the first vehicle in the queue crossing into the intersection. This delay must be taken into account when trying to establish a value for the number of cars that can make it through a light in an hour of green time. This value, in turn, is used in many intersection decisions. 

Our task was to determine how many cars would make it through the intersection in one hour of green time (one hour of green time is the sum of the green times during each red, yellow, green phase until they total one hour). For this study, I downloaded a program SportsWatch v1.4 <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.1661.7074.28465.3290.233.34125625> onto my Handspring Visor Deluxe, which allowed us to record every car crossing, something that would have been impossible with a simple stopwatch. It allowed us to time the crossing of the rear axel for every car in the queue, since when you hit the 'lap' button, it records the time elapsed and outputs it as text. From here, it is a simple matter of copying the results to a memo in memo pad and saving.

Back at the office, we were able to synchronize the Handspring Visor with the Palm Desktop software and the memos containing the information were suddenly digital documents, with no laborious data entry needed. The results could be cut and pasted into a simple MS Excel spreadsheet to be analyzed and used in our study. This made for a more complete dataset, and hopefully more credible conclusions. As well, the cumbersome task of entering the recorded data was avoided by utilizing the quick and simple synchronization system, saving us a considerable amount of time. The Handspring Visor helped to make the data collection process more complete, easier to accomplish, and more efficient to import after collection.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

268,"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected 
Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests 
Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Friday, March 16, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 

Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying 
electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential 
document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle. 
State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging 
$49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers 
figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests. 
The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources, 
which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of 
lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom 
Hannigan. 
To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much 
California is spending on power purchases. 
Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed, 
it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw 
it. 
""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R- 
Redding. 
Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity, 
analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could 
jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term. 
For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education 
programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst 
warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in 
Davis' proposed budget. 
Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit 
rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the 
utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a 
credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans 
to rise. 
""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive 
director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that 
tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the 
energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look 
like in the future."" 
The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent 
nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest 
day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per 
megawatt hour. 
Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison & 
Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices. 
""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he 
said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be."" 
The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the 
state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if 
generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could 
force up the price the next day. 
But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right 
to know how its money way being spent. 
""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he 
said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces."" 
Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have 
filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state 
has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by 
Davis. 
The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated 
only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if 
needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has 
sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional 
money was needed. 
Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5 
billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending 
$43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water 
Resources document. 
Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has 
become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a 
house of cards. 
The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is 
supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will 
be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every 
month. 
- 
Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov. 
Gray Davis is offering rebates for Californians who save on power starting in 
June, and if you've got a strategy for conserving, The Chronicle wants to 
hear it. Contact the Energy Desk, San Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St.,

                  Freeze For Now >PCG 

                  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 


                  SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--PG&E Corp. (PCG) won't try to 
lift California's
                  state-mandated rate freeze before the end of the transition 
to a deregulated market,
                  saying it wants to protect its customers from volatile 
power prices, senior company
                  officials said Wednesday. 

                       ""We aren't moving at this time to end the rate freeze. 
But that view might change in
                  the future,"" said a senior company official, who requested 
anonymity. 

                       PG&E invited reporters to its headquarters Wednesday 
to discuss plans for repairing
                  a ""not workably competitive power market"" and several steps 
the utility plans to file
                  with federal regulators to do that. 

                       One proposal that is expected to be filed with the 
Federal Energy Regulatory
                  Commission is a return to cost-based rates, where the price 
for power would be
                  predetermined based on generation costs. The company wants 
to temporarily put an
                  end to market-based rates. 

                       The utility will also request that California's 
independent system operator reduce the
                  wholesale power price cap to $100 a megawatt-hour from 
$250/MWh. 

                       Company officials said those steps would allow them to 
recover billions of dollars in
                  unpaid power costs and would stabilize wholesale power 
prices and protect retail
                  customers. 

                       PG&E said generators would still be able to make a 
profit on power sold in California
                  with the reduced cap, and the company doesn't believe the 
state's power supply would
                  be in jeopardy from such an action.

"".....Second, California should not abandon its goal of fostering retail
competition.  New competitors need the ample, stable and reliable
electricity supplies that a reformed market system will promote.  Retail
competition can help bring new types of contracts and metering systems, and
better awareness of environmental effects as entrants introduce ""green""
packages, and demand-side innovations.  This is another reason why consumers
must pay the real cost of electricity, as retail competition cannot thrive
in an environment in which supply companies lack retail pricing freedom.  As
a consequence, companies involved in retail supply, including the California
utilities, should be allowed to pass-through their energy costs in a
competitive environment. [At the same time retail customers should be
guaranteed the option of locking in a fixed fair price by the default
supplier and not be exposed to market volatility should they choose to do
so.]

Finally, oversight of the electricity business will always be needed.  The
cornerstones of electricity regulation must be oversight of the distribution
function, and ensuring that any anticompetitive behavior by suppliers is
circumscribed. ""

298,"Many Power Deals Announced By Calif Gov Still Not Final
By Jason Leopold
  
03/07/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 


OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

   
(This article was originally published Tuesday.)

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Many of the long-term power supply contracts 
announced by California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or 
are the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday. 


The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success 
in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be 
an unusually tight summer. 


Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with 
his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed.


David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that 
details remain to be worked out. 


""This is not a done deal,"" Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are 
keeping generators from signing the deals. 


Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts 
that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt-hours of 
electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. 


Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by 
Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. 
(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, 
previously the state's main power market. 


The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power 
Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power 
bills the utilities had failed to pay. 


The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt-hours of electricity 
and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, 
have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy (DUK), one 
of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas & Electric and 
Southern California Edison, has sued Davis for unlawfully commandeering those 
contracts. 


Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power 
to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and 
the Davis administration still have to ""develop a comprehensive long-term 
settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,"" said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams. 


The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California 
Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign 
the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said. 


Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday - 
including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy 
(SRE), Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) - said they have yet to sign 
final agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. 


""We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,"" said 
Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy 
(SRE). Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the DWR and 
expects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. 


Reliant Energy said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state 
that expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term 
contract once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas & Electric 
and Southern California Edison, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. 


Mirant Corp. said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's 
paid. 


Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some 
credit-related details to hammer out. 


""Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,"" Enron 
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

SOFT MARKET OPEN

Futures point to a slightly lower market open as JDS Uniphase 
(JDSU,9.96,f2) and VeriSign (VRSN,53.34,f1) issued revenue 
warnings with their quarterly earnings reports. The University 
of Michigan's index of consumer confidence is scheduled for 
release at 10:00 a.m. EDT.

Fiber-optic equipment maker JDS Uniphase said it incurred a 
fiscal 1Q loss of $1.2 billion or $0.93 per share. CFO Anthony 
Muller said the company would have lost $0.03 per share if 
restructuring and merger related costs were excluded, matching 
the consensus First Call estimate. JDS Uniphase blamed a slump 
in demand for telecommunications equipment for its woes, but the 
company's CEO said he sees a ""low-point"" in demand by December 
or March. As a result JDS Uniphase said it expects a loss of 
$0.01-$0.02 per share in the fiscal 2Q on a 10%-15% sequential 
drop in sales.

Biotech behemoth Amgen (AMGN,58,f1) reported 3Q net income of 
$0.30 per share, $0.01 better than the First Call consensus 
estimate. The company said sales of Neupogen, its treatment to 
prevent infections in chemotherapy patients, rose 2% to $353 
million, while sales of its two anemia drugs, Epogen and 
Aranesp, rose 4.6% to $520 million. Chief Executive Kevin Sharer 
said Aranesp will drive 4Q sales growth and fiscal year 2001 
sales and earnings should rise 10%-12%.

Internet security provider VeriSign reported 3Q pro-forma income 
excluding charges of $0.28 per share, ahead of the Street's 
expectations for earnings of $0.16 per share, but warned that 4Q 
revenues would fall short of expectations. Including charges, 
VeriSign said it lost $1.91 per share.

indicated a desire to file supportive comments.  Edison has indicated an
interest in reviewing our draft for the purpose of considering joining in
our comments.  Please send edited electronic versions with underline and
strikeout to MBD at this address no later than noon tomorrow. These comments
must be filed tomorrow before 5 pm.  I am sorry for the lateness of the
draft, but these are not extensive comments.  Except for the little
bombshell about extending commission jurisdiction over gas marketers, I see
little in the RPD to warrant our opposition.  Even if the Commission
proceeds with the jurisdictional grab, I believe it can be overturned by the

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">As America's stockmarkets reopened after the terrorist attacks, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank both cut <b>interest rates </b>by half a percentage point, to 3.0% and 3.75% respectively. Central banks in Japan, Canada, Britain and elsewhere joined in cutting rates, hoping to maintain the stability of the world's financial system. The Bank of Japan also relaxed monetary policy, and intervened to prop up the dollar.</font></p>

America's stockmarkets continued to slide later in the week. European markets, which had suffered steep drops in the previous week, held up better.</font></p>

Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more 
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group 
of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has 
aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of 
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private 
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to 
Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the 
Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per 
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & 
Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour 
charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 
an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for 
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and 
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. 
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, 
according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased 
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more 
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest 
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have 
reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said. 
""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the 
generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400% 
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging 
us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting 
ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on 
the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's 
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first 
quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the 
first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's 
energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited 
to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the 
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. 
""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in costs since 
his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in 
January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to 
$271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded 
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one 
of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per 
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a 
total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a 
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average 
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of 
Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be 
reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, 
the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered 
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, 
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see 
the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached 
Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing 
the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, 
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas 
prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, 
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems 
in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state 
projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June 
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under 
$100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited 
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term 
power contracts with with ""moving the California electric energy industry 
closer to normalcy.""

Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator says the generator 
is refusing to make public some information crucial to the price-gouging 
probe. Firm says it's complying.

SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price 
gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy 
is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation. 
Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding information 
from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But 
under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public without 
Duke's consent.
The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have 
alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in 
January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the 
electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout 
the state. 
Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts to 
enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential information 
cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public. 
Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that 
gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and 
which stay secret. 
""The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what 
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less,"" he said. 
Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers 
Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information 
elsewhere and ""release it over Duke's objections."" 
Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month 
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in what 
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency. 
But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the 
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity 
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its 
explanation. 
Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full 
picture of the plant's operation during the three days. 
But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, 
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, 
Duke was guilty of the same tactics. 
""Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full 
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions 
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred,"" Dunn said. 
To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive 
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine ""the bids Duke 
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant."" They include the 
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said. 
Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in 
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and 
off-limits to legislators not on the committee. 
Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to 
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke 
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the 
committee plans to turn over. 
""We are complying now,"" Williams said. ""There is some suggestion that we are 
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't 
know what we are ultimately going to do."" 
The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they 
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have 
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, 
were cited. 
Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are 
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally 
charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the 
final arbiter of such issues. 
Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited 
for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most 
recent case, a cement company executive was sent to jail.

Houston Chronicle
California to get plan for refunds 
Officials celebrate judge's proposition 
By DAVID IVANOVICH and LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
WASHINGTON -- Power companies failed Monday to reach agreement with 
California over how much to pay in refunds for alleged overcharging during 
the state's electricity crisis. 
And so the judge who tried to mediate those talks will recommend a plan that 
would generate ""hundreds of millions, and maybe $1 billion"" worth of refunds, 
a far cry from the $8.9 billion California has demanded. 
A marathon, 15-day negotiating session between California and a collection of 
power generators that included Houston-based Reliant Energy, Enron Corp., 
Duke Energy North America, Dynegy and El Paso Corp. ended without the parties 
coming close to clinching a deal. 
""In 15 days you can't work miracles,"" said Curtis L. Wagner, the 
administrative law judge overseeing the talks at the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission. 
As a result, Wagner will propose the five-member commission adopt a plan that 
would result in at least some refunds for power sold between October 2000 
through May. 
California officials quickly seized on that point to claim victory. 
Michael Kahn, head of the California Independent System Operator, called 
Wagner's plan a ""ringing endorsement"" of his states' claims that refunds are 
necessary. 
But Wagner's methodology for determining how those refunds should be 
calculated tilted toward the power generators' position in many key respects, 
hence the wide disparity between his ballpark estimates and California's 
claims. 
Wagner noted that he had not run the numbers under his methodology. Instead, 
he will recommend regulators hold hearings within 45 to 60 days to determine 
exact refund totals. 
California officials insisted the final refund dollars will total ""multiple 
billions."" And they left open the very real possibility they will sue in 
federal court to recoup the remaining dollars they believe they are owed. 
California Gov. Gray Davis, who has been a vociferous critic of the 
commission, went on the offensive again Monday. 
""While in the past the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers, 
they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 
billion California has demonstrated it is owed,"" Davis said in a prepared 
statement. 
During the negotiations, the electric power companies, marketers and other 
suppliers offered to pay $716.1 million, never coming anywhere close to 
California's demands. 
""Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked rate payers out of billions 
of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith with our team 
in Washington,"" Davis said in his last salvo at the out-of-state generators. 
California wanted Reliant, for instance, to pay $376 million in refunds, said 
John Stout, senior vice president for asset commercialization for Reliant's 
Energy Wholesale Group. 
But that's nearly three times the $127 million operating margin the company 
garnered from its California operations between October and May, according to 
a filing the company made with the Securities and Exchange Commission last 
week. 
Stout said Reliant offered to pay slightly less than $50 million. 
""We were essentially offering to refund one third of the operating margin 
over the relevant period,"" Stout said. 
But Davis contends: ""The energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize 
their responsibility to the people of California and own up to their 
profiteering."" 
California's claims for $8.9 billion include sales starting in May 2000. But 
Wagner only considered claims from October onwards. That meant $3 billion of 
California's claims were not part of the settlement talks. 
""For California to continue this bogus claim of $8.9 billion, I think just 
shows that they are not interested in any kind of a settlement,"" Enron 
spokesman Mark Palmer said. ""They are just interested in creating a whipping 
post. The last thing that the political leadership in California wants to do 
is take responsibility for the problem they created."" 
Joel Newton, regulatory counsel for Dynegy and a spokesman for a coalition of 
generators, argued that California's analysis did not account for last year's 
rise in natural gas prices, high environmental costs and transportation 
constraints for both electricity and natural gas. 
The settlement talks were organized not only to try to resolve the 
differences over refunds but other outstanding disputes stemming from 
California's power debacle. 
California, trying to move away from its dependence on power purchases from 
the spot market, has been trying to line up long-term power contracts. 
As of June 12, the state had signed deals totaling $42.8 billion with 18 
different suppliers. As a result, California purchased only 1.9 million 
megawatt hours of power on the spot market, down from 4 million in May. 
But with a slew of civil and potentially criminal investigations, some power 
companies have been loathe to sign long-term deals while those disputes are 
still outstanding. 
The power companies pushed, as part of the settlement negotiations, to have 
those other investigations dropped. But California officials refused. 
""We're disappointed that we were unable to reach a global solution,"" said 
Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel. 
California is not the only Western state seeking refunds. Other states in the 
region have their own claims, totaling more than $6 billion. 
Wagner has proposed holding a separate negotiating session for those states, 
arguing that their concerns had been given short shrift in the settlement 
talks because of the central battle with California. 






INDIA: CEO of Enron's Indian unit Dabhol quits.

07/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, July 10 (Reuters) - The president and chief executive officer of 
Enron Corp's Dabhol Power Company, which is involved in a drawn out row with 
an Indian utility, has quit following the expiry of his contract, a Dabhol 
spokesman said on Tuesday. 
Neil McGregor, who has been involved in crucial discussions to solve a more 
than six-month-old dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB) over payment defaults and high tariffs, will leave for Singapore soon 
to pursue other opportunities, the spokesman added.
""My contract expired on June 30. I have decided against its renewal and will 
pursue other challenges elsewhere in the global utility sector,"" McGregor 
told the Press Trust of India. 
The wrangle has affected India's image among foreign investors and threatens 
nearly $3 billion of foreign investment. 
Dabhol is building a $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW plant in the western Indian state 
of Maharashtra in two phases. The first phase of 740 MW is up and running, 
while the second phase of 1,444 MW is 97 percent complete.

US Enron Chmn Confirms India Dabhol Pwr CEO's Resignation

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) chairman, 
Kenneth Lay, confirmed Tuesday the resignation of Neil McGregor, president 
and chief executive of Enron India's subsidiary Dabhol Power Co. 
""Yes, Mr. McGregor's contract with us ended, and he decided to move on on his 
own. He did a good job with us,"" Lay told reporters.
Earlier Tuesday, India's Economic Times reported McGregor had stepped down 
from his post ""to pursue other projects."" 
Enron India's managing director, K. Wade Cline, will assume the additional 
responsibility of managing operations of Dabhol Power, the report said. - - 
10/07/01 07-12G 

Lay said a meeting with Federal Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha earlier 
Tuesday aimed at resolving a prolonged payments dispute between DPC and its 
principle buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, ended 
inconclusively. 
""We discussed the problems of the Dabhol project. We discussed the avenues to 
end those problems. We haven't come to any conclusion today. We didn't expect 
to come to any conclusion today. We're certainly very hopeful that the 
problems of Dabhol Power Co. can, and will be resolved fairly quickly,"" Lay 
said. 
Enron Corp. has a 65% controlling stake in the US$2.9 billion Dabhol Power 
Project, India's single largest foreign investment. Other shareholders 
include General Electric (GE) with 10% and Bechtel Group Inc. (X.BTL) with 
10%. 
The MSEB has defaulted on payments totaling US$48 million to DPC, which was 
providing electricity from its 740 megawatt power plant located south of 
Maharashtra's capital, Bombay. 
In May, Enron served a preliminary termination notice on the MSEB, which 
stopped buying power from Dabhol. 
DPC said in June that contractors halted work on Phase II due to payment 
defaults. Continuing defaults by the MSEB is making it almost impossible for 
DPC's lenders to disburse additional funds for Phase II construction. 
The stoppage will add to overall project cost, Lay said, adding this was 
beyond the company's control. 
Lay said construction of Phase Two, including the company's liquified natural 
gas import facility, is 85% complete.

State completes history's largest municipal-bond sale 
California's treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in U.S. history Tuesday -- a $5.7 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the state's energy crisis. 
The sale -- coming in an environment of record-low interest rates -- also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record. 
And it provided a backdrop for a warning from state Treasurer Phil Angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited $12.5 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the state's budget in the next fiscal year. 
With the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy, there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year, leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2002. 
The slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis, could force ""Draconian"" budget cuts, Angelides said. 
""We were already facing tough budget times in 2002-2003,"" he said, ""and that was before the tragedy of Sept. 11."" 
Now, if falling revenues are added to the ""$6 billion hole, we'll have deficits akin to the early 1990s,"" Angelides said, noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services. 
Earlier this year, the state advanced $6.2 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
Repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the $12.5 billion in energy bonds -- a transaction Angelides said requires key approvals from the state Public Utilities Commission. 
The huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late October or early November. 
But the plan before the PUC has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities. 
With utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way, regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks, PUC President Loretta Lynch said Tuesday. 
This year, ""we've been taken to court probably five times more than we've been taken to court last year,"" partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because it's been trying to make them so fast, she said. 
But Angelides said that given the delay in PUC action, he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 2002. 
Besides raising the budget concerns, that also could mean that California misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment. 
""I do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year,"" he said, citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow PUC action. 
Tuesday's bond sale to meet the state's cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes. 
The notes are fixtures on California's cash-flow landscape. In 1993-94, for example, the state sold $8 billion through multiple offerings. No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus. 
But a year earlier, in fiscal 1999-2000, $1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs. 
Besides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record, Tuesday's sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes. 
Tuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers. 
""It speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived, particularly in light of Sept. 11,"" said Peter Taylor, senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros. 
As senior manager on the sale, Taylor and Lehman Bros. coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms. 
""There was wide acceptance from a range of investors, retail (buyers), mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations,"" Taylor said. 
The level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $2 billion. That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 2.25 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state, an annualized 2.22 percent. 
The notes mature June 28, 2002. Overall yield, counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance, is only 2.17 percent. 
Had the $6.2 billion in general-fund money been repaid, Angelides said, the need for Tuesday's short-term debt issuance ""would have been substantially less ... if not eliminated."" 
Even so, Angelides said the state was fortunate to ""move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates, and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year.""",Phil Angelides Angelides Loretta Lynch Peter Taylor Taylor,$5.7 billion $12.5 billion $6 billion $6.2 billion $8 billion $1 billion more than $2 billion,"Angelides Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Enron Canada 'critical' to auction in U.S. 
Unit remains solvent: Part of package to sell trading business, Milnthorp says
Claudia Cattaneo, Calgary Bureau Chief 
Financial Post; with files from Bloomberg News 
CALGARY - Enron Canada Corp. cut half its staff and halted its trading operations while waiting for an auction in the United States that could yield a buyer today for Enron's trading business, the president and chief executive of the Canadian unit said yesterday.
Robson Milnthorp said the Canadian arm will be ""critical"" to a deal to sell Enron Corp.'s trading business because it has been the most profitable in the company.
The unit remains solvent, with more than $220-million in cash and more than $100-million owed by counterparties -- partners with whom it has contracts -- that are refusing to honour their obligations, he said in an interview.
If there's no bid for the Canadian operation, Enron Canada will look for a white knight of its own, he said.
""We have been very careful not to jeopardize the efforts made on Houston's part with respect to the [auction]. But if that was to fall through, Canada would attempt to find its own white knight, so to speak. We had numerous expressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time.""
Houston-based Enron Corp. was negotiating yesterday with at least six potential buyers for its wholesale trading business in an auction that was part of efforts to reorganize itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The auction was expected to continue into the evening.
In Manhattan, U.S. bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez scheduled a hearing for today to approve the sale.
Enron Canada was Canada's largest market maker of natural gas and power until it was swept up in the failure of its indirect parent, which unraveled after disclosures that Enron Corp. had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its books. It was left saddled with at least US$40-billion in debt.
Enron Corp.'s troubles deepened this week with revelations that the U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation. There was also an admission yesterday by the firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, that a ""significant but undetermined"" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.
Mr. Milnthorp said the investigation ""has nothing to do with Enron Canada.""
The Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent and re-emerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts, its major asset.
Mr. Milnthorp said the Canadian arm was packaged as part of a deal to sell Enron's overall trading business, which buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and derivatives. The company would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership called ""Netco,"" short for New Energy Trading Company, under the proposed sale. The trading unit generated about 90% of Enron Corp.'s US$100.8- billion in revenue in 2000.
Mr. Milnthorp said 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto were laid off after last month's court proceedings and trading was suspended because of lack of confidence in the market.
""To be successful in this business, you need a very solid balance sheet that creates the confidence necessary to enter into long-term transactions. That's been one of the key criteria through the auction process,"" he said.
Enron Canada's remaining employees are ""trying to manage the estate and trying to work hard to co-operate with our customers to get them paid,"" he said.
The unit is cash rich from the sale last month of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton.
Bidders for all or parts of the trading operation include Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services company, UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, and BP PLC, one of the largest oil and gas companies.

																														NYMEX to Launch Online Trading Next Spring
																														
																														
																														
																														?  The NYMEX plans to launch its online trading platform, enymex, in  the 
second quarter of next year. The system will trade and clear  forward 
contracts for physical commodities such as crude oil,  refined products, 
natural gas, electricity and metals. It will  compete with existing ventures 
such as IntercontinentalExchange and  HoustonStreet. Enymex was originally 
set to start in the third  quarter of this year. NYMEX had been in talks on 
joining ICE before  deciding to go it alone.

																									Concamin to Propose NewRegulated Natural Gas Price  Scheme
																									
																									? ? 
																									? ?  Leading Mexican business association, Concamin, will propose that  Pemex 
adopt a new scheme for determining the price of natural gas.  The details of 
the proposal were finalized at a Tuesday night  meeting of Concamin's Energy 
Committee. Pemex currently uses the  price of gas in southern Texas as a 
price of reference in setting  the price of natural gas in Mexico. Under the 
scheme to be proposed  by Concamin, the price of natural gas would be 
determined with  reference to the costs of extraction, exploration, supply 
and  distribution, plus a reasonable profit margin for Pemex.

?
Here's an idea for an icebreaker activity for our  2nd week of NEON.? This is 
only an idea, you can use it or do something  totally different.? Again, let 
me know along the way if you have something  that has worked well for your 
group so we can share in the wealth.
?
Someone in your group should have a couple of  classic books full of 
icebreaker-game type of activities, Building Community  in Youth Groups, and 
Youth Group Trust Builders.? We all at  one time had a selection of 
icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still  have somewhere in a 
drawer.? Spend time in the games and forced  interactions, especially over 
the beginning of the semester.? If you don't  have these resources, let me 
know.? Even if some of these ideas may seem  familiar to you, remember that 
you may have been doing this far longer than the  oldest kids have been in 
your group.?But again, if you have any ideas for  resources let me know.
?
In addition to the ideas to think about at the top  of the 2nd weeks topic, a 
couple of additional thoughts given me by  leaders:
??? -Realize and possibly  communicate in a low key manner to the freshman 
that their expectations of NEON  may not initially be met.? They may be 
coming in with ideas of what NEON  is, only to possibly be disappointed.? In 
a sense it is similar to going to  a restaurant or movie after tons of people 
have recommended it to you, and being  a little let down.? More importantly, 
they need to realize that NEON is not  an event, it is a process.? The teens 
who say they love it are most often  the ones who have been in it long enough 
to have built relationships and to have  shared a bunch of common 
experiences.? With time and a commitment on their  part to be at NEON weekly, 
their expectations will ultimately be  met.
??? -Remember that the best quality  time you have with the kids is probably 
before or after NEON, or at other  non-NEON times.
?
Have fun loving on your kids  Wednesday!

SCE, California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans; FERC to Meet This
Week
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Southern California Edison (SCE) filed a four-point plan calling on the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to act by year's end to settle
the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting
from California's dysfunctional electricity market. This follows a separate
measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy
purchases. FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov. 1 to discuss the California
power market and remedies for the state's troubled move to deregulate retail
service, which caused drastic price spikes this summer.

ANALYSIS: This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding 
California's
energy market. FERC's meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with
a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some
sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market.

First, let's establish what SCE is proposing. SCE has petitioned the CPUC
to take four immediate steps: 1). Support market reform by providing utilities
with greater freedom to contract for longer-term supplies of power, completing
review of SCE's bilateral contract proposals, and rectifying market structure
problems that have become apparent; 2). Confirm that utilities will be
able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of
customers; 3). Implement a post-rate-freeze rate stabilization plan instead
of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile
wholesale power costs, and provide for a modest rate increase beginning
Jan. 1, 2001, to avoid larger future increases; and 4). End the uncertainty
about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets.

I think this can all be translated as follows. 1). SCE (and presumably
PG&E) want to overturn California's strong resistance against bilateral
contracts. Under California restructuring law, the local distribution company
must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange. Bilateral contracts
with generators are largely prohibited, meaning that currently in California
suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities, as is allowed
in other states such as Texas. 2). SCE and PG&E are both in severe debt,
due to accumulated under-collection resulting from the disparity between
the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service 
territories.
SCE's debt is about $2.4 billion, while PG&E's debt could be as much as
$2.9 billion. Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their
debt. 3). SCE and PG&E want to avoid the sky-high prices that San Diego
Gas & Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to 
market-based
prices this summer. SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase
rates by less than 10 percent, keeping rates at 1996 levels when adjusted
for inflation. SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more
formal proposal to the CPUC, but believes that the less-than-10 percent
increase would be sufficient to recoup its $2.4 billion debt if it were
in place for four to five years. 4). AB1890 strongly encouraged that the
California IOUs divest their power plants, as part of the agreements for
stranded cost recovery. SCE sold 12 natural-gas plants, and presently has
two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow.
The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of
plants currently in escrow, and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide
whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed.

The California ISO's proposal is more specific, but also geared toward
market stabilization. The Cal-ISO wants to implement a $100/MWh bid cap
(reduced from $250/MWh) on electricity purchases in the ISO's spot market.
However, the Cal-ISO's plan includes several exemptions, including those
generators that can prove they will lose money at the $100 rate, generators
that contract 70 percent of their supply to serve California customers,
and generators producing less than 50 MW (renewable power, imported power,
etc.) Thus, the current rate cap of $250/MWh would remain in place and
serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from
the $100 payment cap.

Further, the Cal-ISO wants to require that generators contract 70 percent
of their capacity in forward markets, and that users schedule at least
85 percent of their load in forward markets. The Cal-ISO contends that
California IOUs should be easily able to schedule 85 percent of their load
by entering into contracts with generators. The Cal-ISO wants to affix
a ""real-time deficiency charge"" on both generators and users that do not
use the forward markets. The Cal-ISO submitted its plan to FERC because
it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California, but on
a national basis.

Although the Cal-ISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective,
the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its
own state. The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden
on the Cal-ISO's Real-Time Market, which was designed to handle only 5
percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets, but in fact is
handling about 20 to 30 percent. The Cal-ISO proposal seems to be taking
into account the problem of an out-of-sync wholesale/retail market by 
encouraging
generation to stay in the state.  Otherwise, capped generators may sell
power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed $100
per megawatt hour in the neighboring states.  Should FERC approve this
national rate cap, however, it will be precedent setting and will signal
that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated.

As noted, FERC plans to meet on Nov. 1 to examine the California market
in detail. FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late
August, with its investigation focused on the summer's price spikes, the
state's market structure including the Cal-ISO and the Power Exchange,
as well as market-based sellers in California. The meeting this week 
reportedly
will disclose findings from FERC's investigation and ""consider proposed
remedies.""

 SCE's proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on
FERC's agenda for approval. However, it is likely that whatever FERC decides
will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCE's plan. In particular,
FERC will be examining the issue of market power, and whether or not any
generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system
by withholding generation to drive up energy prices. And the problem is
by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer. Even though
the summer demand season has now ended, wholesale prices remain high, a
problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural
gas across the country.

I'll check with ENA again on the currency swap.  I have spoken with the a 
couple of times about these and they indicate that it is being circulated 
through Law on their side (very slow).
The Lyons base gas sale contract will be a fixed price sale contract pursuant 
to NNG's rate schedule SF (I would not consider this contract to be a 
derivative, it is a sale pursuant to an approved FERC rate schedule).  Morgan 
is working with Legal to create this contract.
I thought that the NNG/TW amendment of terms had been completed.  I'll check 
with Drew, and if they are not completed we should be able to complete these 
in a couple of days (thanks for the heads-up)
Regarding the October purchase contracts: I'll forward this to Morgan for his 
handling of that issue.
Regarding the monthly sale to Kansas Gas:  I'm not familiar with this 
agreement???

I'll be in Houston on Monday and Tuesday if you want to catch me on any of 
these issues.

dollars they spend on Southwest must be reimbursed by TW under our 
agreement.  They might feel free to pour money on Southwest to keep them 
happy, even if Southwest doesn't put much pressure on PG&E and as a customer 
relationship strategy , in the belief that it is Enron money they are playing 
with.  Can we do anything to keep PG&E honest on this?  

Given all of the above,  is it our strategy to continue to manage this

NOTICE: COH OFO/OMO

Date Issued: December 11, 2000 

As a result of returning cold weather and significant under-deliveries by 
shippers on the Columbia Gas of Ohio (COH) system, COH is calling an 
Operational Flow Order and an Operational Matching Order (OMO) for all COH 
Gas Transportation Customers. The OFO/OMO is effective on gas day December 
13, 2000 and will remain in effect until further notice. If conditions 
warrant, these orders will be lifted to reflect the changing conditions and 
COH will advise you of such changes. Customer and marketer banks are not 
available during the OFO/OMO period. 

This notice is applicable to the Customer Choice program. CHOICE deliveries 
should always equal the customers demand curve. The OFO requires the same 
level of delivery, but the tariff provides for additional costs for failure 
to comply.

Customers with daily measurement devices are subject to the OMO. Those 
customers or their shippers are directed to adjust the customer's consumption 
and/or their deliveries to COH so that their deliveries to COH are equal to 
the customer's actual consumption.

Customers without daily measurement devices are subject to the OFO. Those 
customers are hereby directed to adjust their daily scheduled deliveries to 
COH so that those deliveries are equal to 60% of the customer's maximum daily 
volume as specified in the customer's gas transportation contract with COH.

Those customers or their shippers who fail to comply with this OFO/OMO shall 
be subject to penalties for the difference as provided for in COH's tariff. 
COH will continue to monitor weather conditions and demand, in order to 
remove the OFO/OMO as soon as possible.

    Darron Giron
    Brad Jones

    Scott Palmer
 
I anticipate starting the class the first week of October.  This is a little late in the year, with the holidays, to finish by the year end, so we may need January to finish up.  The meeting times will most likely be Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:30am to 1pm.
 
The focus of the class will be learning basic programming/algorithm techniques, using Excel and VBA as a platform, with enough real world experiences and examples to keep your interest.  
 
I would encourage you to talk with Phillip Love and Anne Bike to get their feedback on the progress of the class so far (they are about 3 weeks into the class - although the first 2 or 3 sessions are pretty dry) and the time requirements.  There are bi-weekly reading assignments and exercises to complete.  In addition, I will assign a few projects along the way.  The time required should be very manageable unless something out of the ordinary comes up.
 
Consider your availability.  We are all busy, but I believe if you invest the time in the class it will be beneficial to you.  Let me know if something in your schedule will prevent you from devoting the required time so that I can find a replacement for your slot.  
 
I haven't decided whether to purchase your textbooks myself or make everyone responsible for obtaining their own.  I'll let you know when October is getting closer.

and management quality
? Campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the Corporate Capital Tax,=
=20
the Machinery Equipment Tax and the Corporate Income Tax.

Energy Agenda

According to sources, under the Liberal party's rule, significant changes i=
n=20
the BC government's energy policy could include a move toward the=20
privatization of some BC Hydro assets, perhaps including its transmission=
=20
assets, as well as increased government support for independent power=20
producers and coal-fired production.  At the same time, a rate review and=
=20
attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could=
=20
lead to a lack of clarity about the province=01,s overall energy strategy o=
ver=20
the next few years.  Campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and=
=20
of expanding coal-fired production.  Campbell calls thermal coal, =01&an as=
set=20
that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in=
=20
BC.=018  A high-ranking NDP source believes that Campbell will take the pro=
vince=20
back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting n=
ew=20
technology.  The source expects this to lead to strong protests from=20
environmentalists.  =01&These are confrontational moves, and people will be=
 on=20
the streets.=018=20

Campbell's most likely choice for energy minister is Richard Neufeldt, thou=
gh=20
we caution that this decision depends on the make-up of the legislature aft=
er=20
the election.  Neufeldt is responsible for the Liberal Party=01,s energy, m=
ining=20
and northern development portfolio.  Sources speculate that if right-wing=
=20
Liberals are dissatisfied with the party=01,s performance after the May=20
election, Neufeldt could again defect to the Opposition.  However, this giv=
es=20
Campbell even greater incentive to name Neufeldt energy minister, a=20
high-profile position.

Should the Liberals win the election, Gordon Campbell has indicated that he=
=20
would return BC Hydro to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission.  The BC=
=20
government has derived $5.5 billion in revenue from BC Hydro since 1991=20
(roughly 85 percent of its profit).  Critics say this has undermined the=20
utility=01,s ability to pay down approximately $7.5 billion in debt and inv=
est=20
in the future. This also has left Hydro without a rate stabilization fund,=
=20
something that sources feel may be needed this year.  Campbell reportedly=
=20
intends to address these issues, and one can expect this to lead to calls f=
or=20
change.
=20
Electricity Export Policy

Currently the BC Utilities Commission is demanding more information about B=
C=20
Hydro=01,s out-of-province sales.  The Commission has warned that, given th=
e low=20
snow pack, the utility could be a net importer of power this year. Supporti=
ng=20
this view, the Northwest Power Planning Council, representing BC Hydro=01,s=
 key=20
trading partners in the US, has said that it would not be able to rely upon=
=20
British Columbia or Alberta during peak consumption periods over the next f=
ew=20
years, and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it=20
through the winter without power losses.  The combination of a low snow pac=
k,=20
a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and public concern=20
about outstanding debts owed to BC Hydro by US consumers may force BC Hydro=
=20
to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts expire.

BC Hydro Privatization

A key campaign energy issue for the Liberal party is the privatization of B=
C=20
Hydro.  Campbell has urged greater electricity competition, saying, =01&We =
need=20
to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all, producers an=
d=20
consumers, on an equal and non-discriminatory basis.=018 He stated that=20
independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn. =01&I want=
 to=20
change that big time,=018 he told the Canadian Institute of Energy.  Campbe=
ll=20
also urged more natural gas development, including pipelines and=20
co-generation plants.

Campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by NDP=
=20
leader Ujjal Dosanjh.  Campbell stated on 25 April, =01&We have no intentio=
n of=20
selling BC Hydro; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines=
,=20
no intention of selling their dams, we have no intention of selling their=
=20
reservoirs.=018  Liberal Party spokesman Mike Morton also reiterated on 29 =
April=20
that BC Hydro would not be for sale.  A high-level NDP source commented tha=
t=20
Campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding BC=20
Hydro, essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams, transmissio=
n=20
lines or generating stations, but that he is in favor of opening the sector=
=20
up to competition.

However, local sources believe that some parts of BC Hydro might be sold as=
=20
part of an overall review of BC Crown Corporations to enhance efficiency. =
=20
Likely sale prospects include BC Hydro=01,s distribution channels and its e=
nergy=20
trading subsidiary, Powerex.  In addition, Gary Farrell-Collins, the Libera=
l=20
finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister (after=
=20
Neufeldt), has stated that public ownership of BC Hydro=01,s non-core=20
businesses, such as Westech, its systems division, and customer billing,=20
could come under review.

BC Hydro Williston Generation

Current reservoirs levels at BC Hydro=01,s Williston hydro-generation facil=
ity=20
are at 2,150ft, which allows BC Hydro to drop levels another 35 ft (170=20
Gwhs/ft) under their current permit.  The one drawback to this plan=01,s=20
additional generation involves the Mackenzie pulp mill that would have to=

593,"The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin injury. ""But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will !
co!
me back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games."" Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.</FONT>

""We're going to play Skip more,"" Fisher said. ""We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3066&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - McKay <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3066&key=133462&""><B>Amos Zereoue</B></A>, RB PIT - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3066&key=1070&""><B>Gus Frerotte</B>
</A>, QB DEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3066&key=235220&""><B>James Jackson</B></A>, RB CLE - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>According to the <I>Cleveland Plain Dealer</I>, Jackson could miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3066&key=1177&""><B>Terry Allen</B></A>, RB BAL - Hardtail Amigos <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3066&key=12375&""><B>Doug Flutie</B></A>, QB SD - Metz <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time!

Barber compiled 130 scrimmage yards against Arizona, but he was held out of the end zone. Barber will continue to be a focal point of the Giants' offense, however, and will be a valuable player to have during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Jacksonville's defense was solid once again, holding the Tennessee Titans to just six points on Sunday. They've allowed a total of nine points in their first two games of the season, and are worth picking up should they still be available in your league. <BR>

Defensive end Marcellus Wiley missed Saturday's game against the Miami Dolphins due to a sore hamstring. Defensive tackle Jamal Williams suffered a sprained knee in the game and could miss up to three weeks, and cornerback Alex Molden sustained a slight groin injury. None of these injuries are considered serious. San Diego made some improvements to their defensive unit during the offseason, and might be worth using when your starting defense has a bye week. <BR>

Weakened by a chronic hamstring problem that was showing no improvement over the offseason, Pickens has decided to retire after eight NFL seasons. Pickens, 31, signed a one-year, $500,000 contract earlier this spring with the Dallas Cowboys. But, after missing all of the minicamps and visiting with noted Birmingham, Ala., orthopedist James Andrews he decided to end his career. <BR>

Aikman has decided to retire. Two sources close to Aikman said the 12-year veteran, released by the Cowboys last month, will officially announce his retirement at a Monday afternoon news conference. <BR>

Head Coach Al Groh won't make a decision until Sunday, but a source close to the Jets says that Groh is leaning towards using Conway for placekicking and Hall for kickoffs. Either way, Fantasy owners should avoid using either of the Jets' kickers in their final week of the season. <BR>

Here are some details about the winnebago.  It would be great to keep this
thing in the family.  It would be sad to see it go away to someone else and
not be able to party in it anymore.  It would make me very happy to see this
go to a friend!

1983 Winnebago Brave, 23 foot class A
* Purchased Feb 1999, we are the 2nd owner. It was previously in
Arizona for many many years.
* Brakes, tires, exhaust, and suspension were replaced/upgraded.
* Engine has been replaced with a 1999 Chevy 454, bought brand new and
professionally installed by Carr Chevrolet at a cost of $4,500.  Has a
50,000 mile warranty.  There are only 6,000 miles on this engine.
* The upholstery has been updated.
* Floorboards have been replaced and reinforced.
* Carpet was replaced with commercial grade carpeting made for hotels.
* Refrigerator and stove are only a few years old.
* It has been driven only about 75,000 miles in its entire life.

That is the major stuff.  It will sleep 5 people comfortably, more
uncomfortably.  It will ride with 7 comfortably and accommodate 10 easily.
Gas mileage is about 8, loaded or unloaded.  It is equipped for towing and
can easily tow boats. Insurance is dirt cheap at about $15-$20 per month.

Kevin and I have spent somewhere between $11 and 12 thousand on it, but we
are trying to sell it for $9,000.  Most RV's that are under $10k are pieces
of crap. This one is in great physical and mechanical shape.  Kevin and I
know this thing inside and out and can fix nearly anything on it.  It is
definitely a good deal at $9k. I know there is nothing nicer out there at
this price.

but you were porbably in bed.  So I just went to the store grabbed as six 
pack had a few beers and sat at my computer for until about 3 am.  I was 
really having an enmotional night last night.  I think I just hadn't let go 
of my feelings and it all just came out in one night.  It is funny but the 
next morning I got calls from both Price Strader and Kim Kirkwood to see how 
I was doing.  Did I ever tell you the story about Kim and I at Wilsons 
wedding?    If not I should tell you it is really funny.  Anyway as far as 
watching the game I would love to watch it with you but I have tickets.  
Benny,  Burns, and a bunch of us are taking Benny's Winnebago down there and 
partying.  What sucks though is I have a night shift so basically I will be 
going down there on no sleep.  Regarding Beaches, I would love to do that 
also but, I am leaving on Sunday for LA and won't be back until the day after 
thanksgiving.  So, i guess i will just give you a call or something when I 
get back.  I thought that you would be watching the game with Dave.  Did 
something happen and you guys get in a fight again or something?",Price Strader Kim Kirkwood Kim Wilsons Benny Dave,,

8:30 a.m. WELCOME: WHAT'S IN STORE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS?
8:40 a.m. POWER MARKETING, RISK MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY - Dave Freeman, Senior Director, Aquila
Power marketing is largely the business of price risk management for the energy industry. Energy policy at the state and Federal level can act to facilitate, or cripple the ability of the market to respond to and mitigate threats to price stability.
9:20 a.m. THE SUPPLY RESPONSE: ADDING NEW GENERATING CAPACITY - Lynn H. Church, President, Electric Power Supply Association

10:00 a.m. THE NUCLEAR RESURGENCE - Joe F. Colvin, President and CEO, Nuclear Energy Institute 

After coal, nuclear power remains the most important source of electricity in the US, and with license renewals, and proposed facility expansions, is likely to hold that position for some time to come. Nuclear power economics and opportunities in today's competitive markets.

12:30 to 2:00 p.m. luncheon  

Concurrent Sessions  

WHOLESALE

2:00 p.m. BUILDING COAL-FIRED POWERPLANTS-- Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone 

The US isn't the Saudi Arabia of coal-- it's the whole OPEC of coal. Most power generated in the US is coal-fired, and is likely to remain so. It is not the fuel of the past, it is the fuel of the present and future, with more coal-fired plants planned now than any time in decades. The economics and political realities of coal plant construction. 

2:45 p.m. NATURAL GAS AND POWER - Mike Reed, VP Market & Quantitative Analysis PG&E National Energy Group  

Gas is the dominant fuel for new powerplants, and the dominant source of growth for gas markets, but the markets aren't joined at the hip. How gas and power interrelate, and the public policy implications of market power in both/either markets. 

RETAIL

2:00 p.m. RETAIL MARKETS OVERVIEW Kathleen Magruder, Vice President, Law and Government Affairs, The New Power Company  

What works, and what doesn't, in retail markets. A market-by-market overview of the key opportunities in electric deregulation today. 

2:45 p.m. TEXAS MARKETS   Stephanie Kroger, Partner, Mayor, Day, Caldwell and Keeton  

With the pilots launched and full access in two months, all eyes are on Texas retail markets-- the biggest retail markets in America. How these markets work, how to take advantage of the opportunities they present.

Concurrent Sessions  

WHOLESALE

4:15 p.m. PRIVATIZING TRANSMISSION-- John Howe, Former Chairman of the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, Vice President, Electric Industry Affairs, American Superconductor  

New transmission technologies and the massive growth in electric demand are creating opportunities for investment in transmission. What are the opportunities? How does regulatory policy impact the siting of transmission facilities and their operation? 

5:00 p.m. ISOs, RTO's TRANSCOS & STATUS QUOsDariush Shirmohammadi, PA Consulting. 

How are the various structures of transmission organizations working? What are the prospects for progress in creating super-regional, independent transmission organizations? 

RETAIL

4:15 p.m. CALIFORNIA UPDATE Randy Abernathy, Vice President, Marketing Services, California ISO 

Beyond the hype and headlines-- what's being done to maintain and guarantee continued reliable service in California. 

5:00 p.m. CONSERVATION AND LOAD MANAGEMENT IN URGENT SITUATIONS- Don Fuller, Director, Client Relations, California ISO 

California has recently become a testing ground for mechanisms to manage the demand-side of the supply-demand equation, with dramatically effective results. What went right. 

6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.  Power Marketing Association Reception in Exhibit Hall DAY 2:  Wednesday, October 17, 2001
8:30 a.m. CREDIT RISK AND ITS MANAGEMENT - (Special early morning session) Scott Ettien, Vice President and Tim Moore, Senior Underwriter, NCM Americas.
Price differentials aren't always about time and location-- sometimes they are about the likelihood of being paid. Utilities have traditionally finessed credit requirements by spreading uncollectables among their customer base, and until recently, this was enough to make the utilities themselves bulletproof credit risks. No more. Using credit insurance and internal controls to manage the final frontier in risk management.
KEYNOTE ADDRESS


9:15 a.m. - THE NEW U.S. ENERGY POLICY 
William L. Massey, Commissioner 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 

The senior commissioner at the FERC is seeing many of his views on transmission become the majority position in the new administration.

10:30 a.m. DISTRIBUTED GENERATION - Buck Buckner, Director of Marketing, Stewart & Stevenson 

Power shortages have caused revisitation of the issues associated with distributed generation-- interconnection policy, limits on operations, gas tariffs, siting review, net metering and a plethora of lesser issues. With these changes, the potential for distributed generation has grown significantly. 

11:10 a.m. COMMODITY EXCHANGES: REGULATED AND UNREGULATED- Brad Leach, Senior Director, NYMEX 

As power markets continue to mature, commodity exchanges are slowly beginning to develop, with varying characteristics of liquidity, neutrality and regulatory status. Where exchanges stand today, and where they are heading in the future. 

11:50 a.m. CAREER TRENDS - Marc Granet, President, IDC Executive Search, Inc. 

What jobs will last? What skills become more valuable? How do I build my career in the evolving energy industry?

UK Building Societies To Use Derivatives For Credit Risk
Dow Jones International News - May 11, 2001

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The U.K. Treasury said Thursday that it is proposing
legislation to allow building societies to use derivatives to protect
themselves against credit risk.

Building societies are already allowed to use certain types of derivatives
to protect themselves against interest rate risk, currency risk and house
price fluctuations.

But the treasury proposal - agreed by the Building Societies Commission -
will allow the building societies to use derivatives to protect themselves
against credit risks, a treasury spokesman said.

Unlike banks which are allowed to use derivatives to protect themselves
against credit risk, building societies haven't been allowed to do so so far
because of a clause in the 1986 Building Societies Act.

The proposal will be put to parliament and is likely to be approved unless a
member of parliament opposes it, the spokesman said.

The BSC considers the credit derivatives market to be sufficiently developed
to offer building societies broad and flexible protection.

Credit derivatives will initially be used only by societies which already
have a sophisticated treasury management capability, the treasury said.


Currency swap agreements strengthen Asian co-operation
Financial Times - May 11, 2001
By Edward Luce

Japan yesterday announced that it had concluded bilateral swap agreements
with Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia as part of the region's continued
progress towards strengthened monetary co-operation.

The agreements, which were reached on the first day of the annual conference
of the Asian Development Bank in Honolulu, come a year after the 10 Asian
member countries plus China, Japan and South Korea pledged mutual central
bank support at a meeting in Chiang Mai.

The swap arrangements were designed to provide the former victims of the
1997 Asian financial crisis with firepower to fight off any speculative
attacks on their currencies. Japan said it was also negotiating central bank
swap agreements with the Philippines and China.

But Seichiro Murakami, Japan's deputy finance minister, would not disclose
the nature or the terms of the swaps agreements except to say they were not
based on the defense of any pre-agreed exchange rate levels.

Most of the region's economies have adopted free floating or managed float
currencies after speculative attacks obliterated their exchange rate pegs
with the US dollar in 1997. The bilateral deals provide Korea with Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in possible currency support, Dollars 1bn for Malaysia
and Dollars 3bn for Thailand.

Tun Daim Zainuddin, Malaysia's finance minister, said the agreement, which
comes in addition to the Dollars 1bn pledged in mutual swap support by Asian
countries last November, would help prepare the region for ""any
eventualities"".

""We will not be caught by surprise this time,"" said Mr. Daim. ""Our
currencies are not at risk now. In fact, in most of the Asian countries, our
reserves have increased.""

Mr. Daim also pointed out that the Dollars 1bn in potential support for
Malaysia came in addition to a further Dollars 2.5bn in currency support
that had been pledged by Japan under the ""Miyazawa plan"", named after
Japan's former finance minister.

Unlike the Miyazawa pledge, which comes free of broader conditions, only 10
per cent of the bilateral swap agreement can be drawn before triggering
control by the International Monetary Fund.

Wednesday's announcements mark a weakening of Japan's drive towards the
creation of an Asian Monetary Fund, vetoed by the US in the late 1990s. In
contrast to Tokyo's original goal of devolving more decisions to Asia, Japan
described the bilateral swap agreements as ""complementary"" to the broader
financial framework supervised by the International Monetary Fund in
Washington.

The Honolulu agreements, which will be reviewed in three years, form part of
a broader drive by Asian countries to strengthen regional co-operation
following the 1997 crisis. Such efforts, which span deeper trade
liberalisation within Asian and greater political dialogue between Asian and
its east Asian neighbours, have been given further impetus by the damping
effects of the US economic slowdown on the region's high-tech export sector.


Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, told delegates at the opening ceremony
of the ADB annual conference, that, in spite of the region's impressive
recovery since 1997, Asian countries had to accelerate and deepen efforts to
restructure their financial and corporate sectors.

Mr. O'Neill, whose remarks were clearly directed at South Korea, Thailand
and Indonesia, which are still struggling to resolve the overhang of bad
debts from the 1997 crisis, also urged Japan to take steps to boost
aggregate global demand by confronting obstacles to the revival of domestic
demand


Greenspan Backs Risk-Based Pricing Of Deposit Insurance Provided by FDIC
BNA - May 11, 2001

CHICAGO--Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan May 10 called for
more risk-sensitive pricing of deposit insurance provided to banks by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, saying recent FDIC proposals to move
toward risk-based pricing are ""useful.""

Greenspan spoke at during the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's 37th Annual
Conference on Bank Structure and Competition. Federal Reserve Board Governor
Laurence H. Meyer, who spoke at the conference the same day, said the system
must be adapted to manage the challenges posed by new technologies, new
financial strategies and the globalization of the financial services
industry.

Though Greenspan said federal regulation of the financial services industry
has provided an admirable degree of stability to banks and investors, he
said these benefits come at a significant cost and reform is needed. He
called for financial industry supervisory policies that promote the type of
market discipline that existed prior to the erection of current safety net
structures, which evolved in the wake of the Great Depression. In addition,
he reminded large institutions engaged in risky practices and their
investors that the safety net cannot and will not insulate them from every
type of financial crisis.

Market-based reforms would better protect investors, reduce costs to the
economy, and allocate risk more equitably, the Fed chairman said. ""While
valuing the benefits of stability that the safety net confers, we
nonetheless need to recognize that the benefits are not without costs,""
Greenspan said

""In this context,"" Greenspan added, ""reform of the safety net must remain on
the agenda. I believe this means being very cautious about purposefully or
inadvertently extending the scope and reach of the safety net. It also means
supervisory reform to create, as best we can, inducements to bank behavior
similar to those that would exist with no safety net. And, it means, I
think, that there be a presumption that uninsured claimants are at risk.""

It appears ""politically infeasible"" to eliminate government subsidies of
deposit insurance altogether, but ""more risk-sensitive pricing is
nonetheless helpful, and prudential regulation has already begun to move in
the right direction to reduce the safety net subsidy,"" Greenspan said.

The so-called financial safety net, as currently configured, is comprised of
banking regulation, deposit insurance, the Fed's discount window, and access
to Fedwire and daylight overdrafts, he said. He said these structures
provide depository institutions and market players with a degree of safety,
liquidity and solvency never before seen in economic history.

At the same time, this structure comes at a cost to the economy. Among other
things, Greenspan pointed to distortions in the price signals used to
allocate resources, inducements for institutions to take excessive risks and
relatively high degrees of government supervision as a strategy for limiting
moral hazard.

FDIC Proposal 'Useful.'

To avoid these distortions, Greenspan suggested reforms aimed at pricing and
managing the safety net in a manner aimed at simulating what the markets
alone might do. Toward this end, he called for fairer pricing mechanisms
with respect to FDIC insurance premiums. Greenspan did not discuss specific
components of the recently released FDIC reform proposal, but he described
it as ""useful"" and commented that the plan moves the agency toward better
pricing to safety net access.

On April 5, the FDIC proposed a system under which all institutions would
pay risk-based premiums based on indexed coverage levels and a merger of the
bank and savings association insurance funds (67 DER A-40, 4/6/01). The
House Financial Services Committee will broach the controversial subject of
how best to reform the deposit insurance system in a hearing scheduled for
May 16.

Greenspan also called for regulatory structures aimed at making capital
requirements sensitive to each bank's particular risk profile and exposure.
He said supervision and examination policies are moving in this direction
and are evident in the new Basel Capital Accord.

Finally, Greenspan called for greater market discipline--a factor that
preserved the banking system prior to the development of the safety net.

""The real pre-safety-net discipline was from the market and we need to adopt
policies that promote private counterparty supervision as the first line of
defense for a safe and sound banking system,"" he said.

Disclosure Key, Greenspan Says

To promote this concept, Greenspan called for wider disclosure by financial
institutions so counterparties can better evaluate risk. While banks are
already subjected to significant degrees of disclosure, Greenspan said the
quantity and quality of the data is often uneven. He suggested that, ""all
entities could, should, and may soon be required to disclose more and better
data.""

But Greenspan stressed that market discipline will never be achieved unless
uninsured private counterparties understand that they will not be protected
by the safety net. He suggested too many players live under the false
assumption that they will always be made whole under a, ""de facto
too-big-to-fail policy.""

""Let me remind you that the ten largest U.S. banking organizations fund only
about one-fourth of their worldwide banking assets with insured deposits,""
Greenspan said. ""Let me also remind you that the least-cost resolution
exception [contained in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act] does not require that all uninsured creditors be made
whole, but rather only that they be made no worse off than they would have
been if the bank were liquidated. The potential for greater market
discipline at large institutions is substantial.""

Greenspan said he could conceive of ""rare situations"" when the FDIC or other
governmental resources would temporarily be used to sustain failing
institutions pending managed liquidation, but that ""indefinitely propping up
insolvent intermediaries is the road to stagnation and substantial resource
misallocation, as recent history attests.""

Meyer Seconds Reform Call

Meyer, in his speech, also argued for a more risk-based regulatory
structure. Meyer acknowledged the FDIC's April 5 proposal for reform but
would not comment on it. Meyer complimented the agency on its diligence, but
said the board would withhold judgment on the plan until it has had a chance
to fully review it.

""There seems to be a widespread feeling, which I share, that additional, or
at least improved, efforts toward limiting moral hazard, enhancing market
discipline and lowering taxpayer liabilities should and can be made,"" Meyer
said. ""Our world is a rapidly changing place with technological change,
financial engineering, globalization and deregulation combining to alter the
realities we all face. As a result, all of us must be willing to adapt old
policies and adopt new one if the circumstances require.""

Meyer noted that, unfortunately, existing risk-based capital standards are
becoming divorced from the realities of modern risk management for a growing
number of financial institutions. As such, he said the 1998 Basel Accord's
capital ratios have become a less reliable tool for determining the capital
strength of a particular firm. Meyer said the new Basel Capital Accord
creates standards that will reflect the true risks being taken by the most
financially sophisticated and complex banks. He called on bankers to provide
public comments on the proposal to the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision by the end of May.

""[I]t is of the highest priority that, for the most financially
sophisticated and complex banks, we make the capital standards more
reflective of the risks that they are, in fact, taking,"" Meyer said.


FDIC's Murton Speaks

Arthur J. Murton, director of the FDIC's division of insurance, also spoke
at the conference. He said that in developing the reform plan, the FDIC
hoped to make significant improvements in the safety net while acknowledging
political realities.

""We hoped it would represent an intersection of sound economic and financial
principles on the one hand and political realities on the other,"" Murton
said during the same panel discussion with Meyer. ""Our goal was to offer a
framework that, with further discussion and modification, could generate a
consensus around these issues and could make its way through the legislative
process. We might have come up with a different approach if we had started
from scratch. Instead, we recognized that passing banking legislation
without a banking crisis requires consensus.""

Murton said the plan calls for a merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the
Savings Association Insurance Fund and the elimination of current
restrictions on charging risk-based premiums. In addition, the plan calls
for indexation of insurance coverage levels to reflect inflationary changes
and a shift from the current 1.25 percent Designated Reserve Ratio to a
target level between certain ranges. The plan also suggests the development,
for the first time, of a rebate system when certain triggers are achieved.


SEC, CFTC Propose Joint Rules For Trading of New 'Security Futures'
BNA - May 11, 2001

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange
Commission announced May 10 that they have proposed joint rules to implement
new statutory provisions relating to security futures products.

""Security futures"" are single stock futures and futures on narrow-based
stock indices--given new life by last year's sweeping Commodity Exchange Act
reform legislation after a nearly 20-year ban.

In related matters, the SEC May 8 proposed rules and a new registration form
for designated contract markets and derivative transaction execution
facilities to use to register as national securities exchanges to trade the
new instruments (Release No. 34-44279, 5/8/01).

Joint Regulation

Under the law, security futures are ""securities"" under the federal
securities laws, but may be traded on either futures or securities
exchanges. The CFMA also established a framework for the joint regulation of
security futures products by the CFTC and SEC, the agencies noted. However,
they added, futures contracts on broad-based indexes remain under the
exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

Accordingly, the SEC and CFTC related, they proposed joint rules regarding
the distinction between broad-based and narrow-based security indexes.
According to the regulators, the CFMA defines the criteria for an index to
be considered ""narrow-based,"" including, among other factors, the market
capitalization of each security in the index and the dollar value of that
security's average daily trading volume. The statute also requires the two
agencies jointly to specify the methods that must be used to determine these
values.

In their release, the SEC and CFTC said the proposed rules ""are designed to
fulfill that statutory mandate, as well as to address other issues that
arise in the application of the definition of narrow-based security index.""
They noted that trading in security futures products may begin Aug. 21,
provided certain regulatory requirements are met.

After considering any comments, the agencies said, they expect to adopt
final rules prior to Aug. 21.


New Rules to Improve Competitiveness Of European Markets, Commissioner Says
BNA - May 11, 2001

Key legislation needed to make European financial markets more competitive
with U.S. markets is expected to be introduced by early 2002, Frits
Bolkestein, a Dutch member of the 20-person European Commission, said May
10.

In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Bolkestein reaffirmed the
European Union's commitment to requiring all E.U.-based companies to use the
International Accounting Standards (IAS) practices in their record keeping
in order to enhance transparency and provide higher quality financial
information to investors across the world.

""The use of one global accounting language will greatly benefit European
companies. It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital,""
Bolkestein said. He added that the legislation would require companies to
begin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by 2005.

Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms in
the European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with the
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standard used in the United
States.

A major reason that changes are needed in the European Union's financial
regulations is because of the ""unprecedented volume of mergers and
acquisitions"" between American and European firms.

Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming
""the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world,
capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs, and greater social
cohesion,"" Bolkestein said.

Since 1990, Bolkestein said the European community has added 900,000 jobs
and has seen improved competition and productivity add 1.5 percent to gross
domestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single market
for financial services.

If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by
2005, Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost of
capital for all companies, a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market,
lower costs of purchasing financial products, and higher returns on pensions
and investment funds.

To realize those benefits, Bolkestein said the European Commission would
like to see an integrated securities market in place by 2003, replacing the
individual domestic securities markets of the European Union's 15 member
states.

""Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking down
barriers, pooling liquidity, reducing clearing costs, decreasing volatility,
and increasing transparency,"" Bolkestein said. He added that Europe is also
seeing ""a marked increase in the number of on-line brokerage accounts, which
further contributes to efficiency and transparency,"" but also creates a
greater need for changes in the way the European Union regulates its
financial sector.


Top securities lawyer set to head SEC
Financial Times - May 11, 2001
By John Labate

President George W. Bush yesterday named securities lawyer Harvey L. Pitt to
head the US Securities and Exchange Commission after one of the
administration's longest searches yet to fill a key post.

If approved by the Senate, Mr. Pitt would replace Arthur Levitt, who stepped
down as chairman in February after more than eight years. Mr. Bush is
expected to send a formal nomination to the senate soon but no date for a
confirmation hearing has been set.

Mr. Pitt, a partner at New York-based law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver
& Jacobson, is widely regarded as one of the country's leading experts on
securities law and one of its toughest litigators.

His long list of clients has included Ivan Boesky, for whom in 1986 he
negotiated a $100m settlement with SEC officials on insider trading charges.
Other clients include LLoyd's of London, the New York Stock Exchange, and
all ""big five"" accounting firms.

The move would return Mr. Pitt, 56, to the SEC, where he worked for a decade
after law school and where, at age 30, he served as its youngest ever,
general counsel. He has remained at Fried, Frank, Harris since leaving the
SEC in 1978. The planned nomination comes as the SEC faces a number of
difficult issues, including decisions on the structure of securities trading
as more markets, inside and outside the US, seek to become publicly traded
companies.

""We're heading into a period of globalisation that will call for change,""
said Richard Phillips, former SEC assistant general counsel and partner at
the law firm Kirkpatrick & Lockhart. ""It won't be for congress to take the
lead but a chairman with vision, and Harvey could be that kind of chairman.""

The decision to nominate Mr. Pitt was welcomed by Senator Phil Gramm, the
Republican
Chairman of the Senate banking committee, which oversees the SEC. ""I look
forward to working with him and anticipate prompt consideration of his
nomination by the banking committee,"" he said.

Mr. Pitt is known as a tireless worker, who employs three secretaries to
work round the clock for him.

""Some people are going to have to run quicker and run longer to keep up with
him, but the vast majority of people here are delighted with the choice,""
said one SEC staff member.

Mr. Pitt will be closely watched in the coming months for his views on
several controversial rules passed in the final year of Mr. Levitt's term.
Among them are those on overseeing consulting services by accounting firms
and a new disclosure rule, Regulation Fair Disclosure, fiercely opposed by
securities firms.

The administration encountered unexpected difficulty in filling the top SEC
job. Several leading candidates withdrew from the process or turned down
offers.

Mr. Bush still has to fill forthcoming vacancies among the SEC's
commissioners. He named Laura Unger, a corn- -missioner, as acting SEC
chairman soon after Arthur Levitt stepped down.


Bush Intends to Nominate Roseboro for Treasury Job
The Wall Street Journal - May 10, 2001

WASHINGTON -- President Bush announced his intent to nominate Brian C.
Roseboro, of New York financial-services giant American International Group
Inc., to be assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets.

The job involves making and implementing policy on capital markets and
federal-debt management. Mr. Roseboro is deputy director of market-risk
management for AIG.

Mr. Roseboro earlier worked at financial-services firm SBC Warburg Dillon
Reed, from 1993 to 1996, and at First National Bank of Chicago, from 1990 to
1993, the White House said. From 1983 to 1986, he held several positions at
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, including chief dealer for
foreign-exchange trading.

Election records show Mr. Roseboro didn't contribute to Mr. Bush's
presidential campaign, although AIG's political action committee contributed
$5,000 to it, and also gave $5,000 to his GOP rival, Arizona Sen. John
McCain. AIG Chairman Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg raised at least $100,000 for
Mr. Bush in the insurance and financial-services industries.


Darwinism With Chinese Characteristics
The Asian Wall Street Journal - May 11, 2001
By Pu Yonghao

The expansion of China's capital markets is central to the government's plan
to finance long-term economic growth. While observers have focused primarily
on efforts to reform and broaden the equity markets, two other developments
are important to meet the objective: a mature debt market and a wider
variety of derivative products.

About 1,100 companies are listed on China's domestic stock exchanges in
Shanghai and Shenzhen. About 90% are state-owned enterprises and some 62% of
the total issued shares are state held. The two bourses combined had a
market capitalization of $580 billion at end of 2000, though some
two-thirds, about $360 billion, of A shares (which can be purchased only by
Chinese investors) are in state hands.

Chinese companies generally turn to banks for funding. By the end of 2000,
bank lending was $1,200 billion, equivalent to 112% of China's gross
domestic product. In the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the
government realized that a dependence on bank lending leaves both the
corporate and banking sectors vulnerable to crises. That is why it has
decided to expand the capital markets to finance long-term growth. If all
goes well, the market cap of the two boards together is likely to double to
$1.2 trillion by 2005 and play a leading role in the country's evolution
into a market economy.

The reasons for this kind of growth are numerous. First, China's economy
should grow at an annual average rate of 7.5% between 2001-05, bringing
total GDP to about $1.6 trillion (based on an inflation of 2%). The
country's high savings rate of 40% (currently $809 billion) should provide
ample capital to facilitate the expansion.

Second, the government is pushing forward with the reform of SOEs.
Privatization, the reduction state holdings and expansion of the private
sector will increase the market-capitalization-to-GDP ratio. Listing SOEs
will deepen the restructuring program and usher in good corporate
governance.

Moreover, the government's fiscal resources are limited. Revenues comprise
only 14% of GDP and social-welfare costs are rising. The growth of the stock
markets is likely to help expand China's private sector and bolster
employment at a time when many SOEs are downsizing their labor forces.

The stock markets will also become an important vehicle for channeling
long-term investment, and thus help increase the efficient allocation of
capital and improve returns on infrastructure projects. And finally, foreign
investors and investment banks are expected to play an active role in the
domestic markets after China's accession to the World Trade Organization.

But this picture of thriving capital markets will be incomplete without the
speedy evolution of debt trading and derivative instruments. The development
of a debt market is important because bank savings remain China's primary
investment vehicle, despite a 20% tax on deposit interest income and
historically low interest rates. Bonds generally offer relatively high
returns with low risk and fill the gap between high-return, high-risk
equities and low-return yet safe bank deposits.

Moreover, social security funds need to hold bonds to balance their
portfolios. A mature debt market diversifies the financing channels of
enterprises, enabling them to gain capital leverage. Debt pricing is more
sensitive to interest rates, spurring more efficient capital pricing and
thus allocation.

A mature debt market can also help finance the state's budget deficit and
provide capital for long-term construction projects. Government bonds enable
effective monetary policy through open-market operations. The use of bonds
to control the base money supply reduces the reliance on a credit plan for
implementing macro-economic objectives. The government's ability to conduct
open-market operations can help it control the impact of external capital
inflows.

The Chinese government appears to be drafting debt-market regulations that
will allow the listing of more corporate bonds, firms to use the proceeds as
they see fit and new debt products. But many other issues need to be
addressed before the debt market can take off.

First, an environment of commercial trust and a system for contract
enforcement and liquidation must be established. Second, a comprehensive and
reliable credit-rating system is needed. Some mainland Chinese rating
agencies are pressured to make positive evaluations. When rating agencies
are reliable, investors can better gauge whether a company will repay.

Third, a benchmark rate and yield curve must be established. Currently, the
benchmark coupon-rate on debt is a one-year deposit rate of 2.25%, but this
is not entirely appropriate. The coupon rate is 3.07%, for example, on a
five-year treasury bond, 2.87% for a three-year treasury bond, and capped on
the former at 4%. This provides little scope for corporates to price new
issues attractively. The average yield of listed-corporate debts is already
4.5%, or 5.1% for maturity of more than five years.

Moreover, debt markets need to merge. At present, trading occurs at
exchanges or between banks. Since trading volume is small and liquidity low,
prices face distortion. The trading volume of enterprise bonds, for example,
is just 1% of treasury bonds.

Finally, there is need for a wider range of debt products (for example,
floating-rate bonds as opposed to simply fixed-rate debt instruments). As it
stands now, there only about 10 types of corporate debts. Most are
zero-coupon bonds, one is floating.

The development of derivative products would provide another important
impetus to growth of the capital markets. Mainlanders have few financial
products to choose from -- just 1,100-plus listed stocks and a handful of
corporate bonds and closed-end funds. China does have some futures
exchanges, but trading is limited to a few commodities like soybeans, wheat
and copper.

The trading of derivatives would enhance economic efficiency. First, they
enable investors and underwriters to hedge their positions and ""lock in""
profits. Second, derivatives temper stock-price volatility by reducing the
concentration of money in one market. Once an index derivative market is
established, variance between two markets can prompt arbitrage
opportunities. Derivatives also enable better risk management, attracting
more capital to the stock markets, especially risk-sensitive pension,
insurance and offshore funds.

However, the value of mature capital markets goes beyond capitalization.
Full fledged, they can force enterprises to compete for funds, weeding out
the weak from the strong. Last month, the China Securities Regulatory
Commission delisted washing-machine maker Narcissus from the Shanghai Stock
Exchange after the company racked up four consecutive years of losses. The
rules for stripping companies of their listing had been murky, but the CSRC
assertively clarified them in February, saying firms posting three or more
years of losses would be given just six months to make a profit or face
delisting. Narcissus soon came back with a turnaround plan, but the Shanghai
exchange rejected it, claiming the proposal was unworkable. That's just one
example of an array of reforms regulators are pressing ahead with to bring
China's capital markets in line with the survival-of-the-fittest ethos that
characterizes their more mature counterparts elsewhere.

655,"I exchanged v-mails with Elena Scmid at the ISO.  The leaked information 
pertains to a filing to be made at FERC today that responds to the FERC 
Staff's report on market mitigation.  The ISO had last week released its own 
proposed market mitigation plan -- or, as they referred to it, the market 
stabilization plan.  There was much negative response to it.  I spoke against 
it at the Board meeting and submitted written comments in opposition.  The 
Board blessed it ""in concept"" and agreed to the let the staff file it, but to 
ask the staff for a few changes.  I would be surprised if much has changed 
since we've seen it.  Along with the filing are two staff reports, one by 
Angeli and one by Eric Hildebrandt that identifyy what they see as market 
power.  According the Elena, she does not believe that the reports use the 
term ""gouging."" These reports are just extenstions of what we've seen from 
the ISO before.  Previously, the ISO talked about $650 million or so in 
potential refunds.  These reports extend the time period of the analysis.  
I've asked Elena to let me know if Enron is named and when it will be 
posted.  Elena says that the ISO also asks for the mitigation period to be at 
all times not just at 5% of the time as FERC has sugested.

It is not yet posted on the ISO web site.  The ISO is holding press 
conference now and I'm listening in.

My understanding is that Hebert doesn't have the legal authority (and the 
filing never makes clear) to Suspend performance under the PPA (he probably 
doesn't have the political support for this either).

EPSA, however, could support this in its filing as a method to help move the

671,"Hi Rod,

I know you will be looking into cost and support issues relating to the services we get from Enron Global Finance.  I am of the opinion that the dedication of a talented Global Finance professional will provide us with a much better work product (service) at a significantly lower cost, if we can get EGF to allocate 100% of the cost of the employee and eliminate their allocation to us entirely.

I would like to suggest that you consider Dan Castagnola as the dedicated resource.  Not only is Dan very familiar with all or a majority of our projects from both the commercial as well as the finance perspective, but in my experience working with him, he is an extremely creative and talented business person.  I would feel very fortunate to have Dan on my team.

Just a recommendation ...

I just got off the phone with Darren Vanek.  We have been talking  about what is needed for about a month now.  Almost two weeks ago he said  he wanted a contract that allowed him to call for a letter of credit if one were  needed in the future and that would suffice.
 
Apparently, a paralegal, is involved in generating such a contract and she  was out all of last week.  Darren said that he has no control over when the  contract actually gets sent to me.  Please do what you can to expedite the  emailing of that contract to me so that I can order gas beyond Dec. 2001.

752,"CIG Plans New Line From Rockies to Midcontinent 
Colorado Interstate Gas has announced an open season running through July 20 for a new pipeline to transport Rocky Mountain gas from the Cheyenne Hub to connections in the Midcontinent area near Greensburg, KS. 
CIG said it has completed the archaeological, environmental and right-of-way surveys necessary to file an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by this coming October and complete the pipeline by late 2003. The company said it ""has been working with interested shippers in developing this pipeline project over the past year in response to concerns that Rocky Mountain gas supplies could exceed pipeline takeaway capacity."" 
The line would consist of 380 miles of 30-inch pipe and 17,000 hp of compression to carry about 540 MDth/d of gas. Planned interconnects include ANR Pipeline, CMS Panhandle Eastern, Northern Natural Gas, Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Williams. 
Based on the current design, the transport rate would be 28 cents/Dth, plus an estimated 0.8% fuel and unaccounted for gas, and any authorized surcharges such as an ACA charge. Prospective shippers are asked to complete an offer sheet for a 10-year contract, stating their maximum daily quantity, receipt and delivery points, acceptance of the 100% load factor rate of 28 cents/Dth, and any other conditions required of the shipper. 
CIG will notify winning bidders by July 23 and execute binding precedent agreements for firm transportation by Aug. 17, 2001. At that point CIG will evaluate all precedent agreements to determine if the project is economically viable. Contacts are Craig Coombs at (719) 520-4387 or Laine Lobban at (719) 520-4344.

 What is meant by a ""new review of this agreement""?  Have they reviewed the 
master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit 
requirements into the standard agreement?  
 I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in 
numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a 
Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or 
purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply 
because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other 
parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability 
provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc.  
Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not 
signed, no agreement.  
 Let's discuss where we go from here.

777,"Mary, further to your voicemail of today, the status of Lakeside is as 
follows:

I spoke with Derek and Ed Sacks and we determined that, since we were having 
difficulty in getting Lakeside to provide the agreed upon guarantee and 
execute the ISDA, we would send out the confirm to try and at least get some 
paper signed that might provide us with some rights against them if they 
decide not to perform.  The confirm was drafted in a way that it referenced 
the 1992 form of ISDA rather than a specific ISDA between the parties, such 
that, if they execute the confirm but not an ISDA, at least we can point to 
the base ISDA contract to create some provisions around the transaction.  If 
the ISDA gets signed, the transaction will roll up under it.  The confirm has 
not yet been executed by Lakeside.  Derek is exerting as much commercial 
pressure on them to perform as he can, short of threatening to sue them.  If 
we do not get action on this by Lakeside this week, we are contemplating 
elevating our actions to perhaps commencing an action against them (or at 
least making the threat thereof).

Hope this helps.

the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don

For weather derivatives conducted by Enron North America with counterparties 
in Japan:

1.  There is a ""relatively low risk"" (quoting Baker & McKenzie) that such 
transactions will be considered gambling in Japan.  However, such risk is 
deemed to be even lower, when utilizing an offshore entity.  The risk has 
been determined to be sufficiently low to utilize Enron Japan Corp. as the 
Enron entity engaging in these transactions, therefore utilizing ENA should 
also be acceptable.

2.  I note, there will be foreign exchange reporting requirements for the 
Japanese counterparty to the transaction, both at the time the transaction is 
entered into and each time a payment is made (or netted).  There are no 
Japanese reporting requirements applicable to Enron North America.  Further, 
a default by the Japanese counterparty in compliance with its reporting 
requirements will not effect the enforceability of the transaction.

3.  I have copied Susan Musch on this correspondence, to obtain her input 
from the tax perspective.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Cheers,

John

     It was great to speak with you the other day regarding your new role!

If it is possible I would like to speak with you tomorrow (I will phone you)
regarding a dilemna that has come across my desk the past few days regarding
companies that are creating OnLine Exchanges like Enron's.

     I am finding some inconsistency in the legal contracts to be executed 
among
the Online Exchanges as to appliciable Law, Jurisdiction and Waiver of Right 
to
litigate in favor of Arbitration.

     I would be curious to know how you are handling such matters at Enron? I 
am
of certainty that in the Online Agreement executed between BNP Paribas and 
Enron
Online (I gave us the okay to execute) Enron Online's contract did not insist 
on
Arbitration over standard law and jurisdictional matters.

     Is it possible to discuss a little further tomorrow with you? If so, I 
will
telephone at any time you are available. Thanks much. Kind regards.

This note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress 
toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line 
of products.  

It is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane 
warning frequency and/or duration.  It is our objective to develop derivative 
products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this 
exposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural 
counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:

Pro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane
The Weather Channel    Resorts
Home Depot     Cruise Ships    
Lowes      Riverboat Casinos
CNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries
Local TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces
Dry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams
Chainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments
Insect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments


It is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is 
important to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature 
while the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have 
documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the 
thought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional 
products and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in 
bundled regional products depending on their exposure.

Thus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data 
from 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by 
year, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning 
duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary 
data sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S 
coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly 
similar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North 
Carolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida 
Panhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.

While this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it 
has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration 
is quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, 
when graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to 
effectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning 
frequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be 
well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly 
probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.

As we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be 
scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, 
satellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go 
further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn't decline.

On the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the 
Weather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given 
our positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the 
easiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when 
we should approach customers.

Please respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.


Thanks,

Charlie

- Exotic Library :
 
Issue :  The London version is different from the Houston version.
  The problem is that some bugs in the London version were found.

Temporary solution: Bugs were immediately fixed at a local level.

Permanent Solution:  The London Exotic Version will be replaced by the 
Houston Exotic Version.
   The Houston Version is expected to be robust. 
   Sharad (London Research) is spending this coming week in Houston. 
   When Sharad is back to London, the Houston version will replace the London 
version.

Approach:  Steven Leppard is designing a regression testing procedure that 
will involve IT to fully test the similarity of the two versions.
  The procedure is expected to take at least one month from commencement.
  Hopefully, no discrepancies will be found.
  In the adverse case it happens, it will be necessary to conduct an analysis 
to decide what is wrong.
  If necessary  further testing and development has to take place.

As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning 
portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no 
such capability currently exists.
According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this 
opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far 
as we know, has
constructed such a vessel.  

I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the 
Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they 
have not
built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel 
would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required 
operational and 
environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.  
Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,
http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm

Please let me know if any further research is needed.

978,"Dear guys

Having been out of the office for a couple of days, I've found myself the 
victim of theft (again).  This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from 
its ""hiding place"" under my telephone.  I *always* lock my drawers and keep 
the key in the same place, but on arriving in the office today I found the 
drawers unlocked, and the key missing.  Although there's nothing sensitive on 
or around my desk, I'm concerned about the security implications of someone 
sniffing around the office in this manner.  I also found the papers on my 
desk extensively reshuffled last week.

Last year, in our old office, I had my only two real options books stolen 
from among the many and varied books on my desk.  That couldn't have been a 
random theft, and I fear this isn't either.  I can't understand who'd be so 
interested in a Research guy's belongings!

Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious 
activity around my desk?

997,"This has been a great year for RBAC and GPCM.
During the year we have doubled to 10 the number of GPCM licensees.
This means we've also doubled the number of wonderful people we've trained
and are supporting.
And, I sincerely mean it when I say it has been a real pleasure working
with you all.
One of the things we stress when we are selling GPCM is that it takes a
strong commitment on the part of the licensee, a commitment to find skilled
and dedicated people to make optimal use of this sophisticated tool.  And,
I'm happy to report that we have that quality in the GPCM teams we work
with.
Next year we have some big challenges.  We will be converting the system
from Office 97 to Office 2000 and will also need to make sure it will run
in the Windows 2000 environment.
We will be adding new flexibility in defining our transportation zone price
curves to enable users, especially pipeline users, to test variations of
pricing strategies for their impacts on basis and utilization.
We will be adding a capability for modeling future FT contracting.
We will upgrade our existing Database Comparison program to allow you to
select those items you want to have automatically updated in your own
databases.
We will continue to work with RDI to improve pipeline and storage
infrastructure representations, to provide interfaces between GASdat and
GPCM, and to give you regular optional updates for your own databases.
We are beginning to plan out a new website dedicated to GPCM licensees (and
possibly prospects).  We have acquired gpcm.rbac.com and gpcm.net for this
purpose.
In making these various changes, we look also to you, our existing
licensees, for enhancement and improvement ideas.  We are planning to
conduct interviews of our licensees during the next 30 - 60 days to find
out what you like, but also what you would like to see improved, as well as
some new ideas for GPCM.

I would like to thank the following people for their contributions to GPCM
during 1999.

o Liam Leahy for his excellent marketing, sales, and planning support
o Charles Carr for his quality work on our website and support with subtle
Visual Basic programming issues
o Richard Berman for thorough research on design tools and skilled Windows
programming
o Richard McBride for continuing support and development of his EMNET
optimization program
o Aaron and James Brooks for design and production of the PowerPoint
pipeline maps now available in GPCM
o Mike Farina and RDI for their continuing improvement of the GPCM data and
GASdat database
o GPCM users who have found data bugs and reported them to use so that we
could get them corrected
o GPCM users who have suggested new features which would make GPCM a better
product
o GPCM users who have given us sales leads during the year
o GPCM users who have used GPCM to help their companies make better plans
and decisions, which is, after all, the purpose for which it was designed

We hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season and look forward to an
even better year 2000.

Today's focus: Protect your NetWare

By Dave Kearns

I've been telling you for some time how good NetWare 6 is. Most
major technical publications have also been telling you how
good NetWare 6 is. Even the occasional story in the mass media
has generally spoken well about NetWare (when the writer has a
vague understanding of networking technologies). What's been
lacking, though, is recognition by third party vendors and
other so-called ""after market"" suppliers that NetWare 6 is an
important player in enterprise networks.

I was surprised to see, for example, that almost six months
after the release of NetWare 6 there are still no books in
print about the operating system - not even from Novell Press!

That's why it's so gratifying to see a new release of a
software package intended specifically for the NetWare 6
platform. Network Associates' McAfee division has just released
a new version of its flagship NetShield product for the new
NetWare operating system.

NetShield 4.6 for NetWare 6 allows you to protect all of your
NetWare servers from malicious attacks and viruses through a
single console installation. Moreover, NetShield 4.6 includes
integration with McAfee's ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO), which
provides reporting and trend analysis, as well as remote
software deployment.

Also new in this release is support for Novell Cluster
Services. That's important since each box of NetWare 6 includes
a license for a two-server cluster. You can view, select and
scan mounted cluster volumes with NetShield 4.6, which also
provides ""survival support"" whenever a cluster server is off-
line. McAfee's ePO works in conjunction with NetShield to
extend the technologies used for antivirus protection to more
generalized network management, including policy management and
software deployment.

NetShield 4.6 will run on NetWare 4.11 or higher - although
NetWare 6 specific functions, such as clustering support, won't
be available with earlier versions of the Novell operating
system.

McAfee products have always been at the forefront of virus
protection and at the forefront of NetWare-based applications
for many years. Now McAfee is at the forefront of NetWare 6-
specific applications. McAfee deserves your support and you
should, at least, take a look at its offering.

Sorry for the delay. Here are he comments.

Vince

************************************

Sorry for long delay in responding. I have a few comments. Most are focused
on the third article as here is till time to make modifications.

1.  In the second article, I would mention that the formulation of the mean
reversion process represents one of several possible equations that capture
the same type of market evolution of prices over time.
2.  One comment that applies to both articles. The problem is how one defines
the time series of energy prices. The numbers used for Australian NSW pool
prices seem to correspond to chronological prices. One alternative approach
is to build different time series for the corresponding time intervals for
each day. This would result in different price behavior and estimates of
jump. The choice is one of convenience and depends on actual problem under
investigation. One could argue that volumes of electricity traded during
different time slots represent different economic commodities.
Figure 3a (Jump Frequency) has units on the vertical axis that require
explanation. Are we talking about an expected number of jumps in the total
number of half hourly periods in a year? The same goes for f in Table 2
(article number 3).

1006,"Naveen,
I was trying to find ""fat tails"". I looked at NG prompt month prices' 
log-returns for 5 years  9 months.
On the figure below you can see the comparison of empirical cumulative 
probability function with normal 
cumulative for this time series (standardized: mean subtracted, divided by 
stdev). The effect of fat tails
is not pronounced so much. The ""fat tails"" effect was much more visible on 
your plot when you looked at the 
oct-00 prices log-returns versus my time series of prompt month's prices.
The shape of the distribution is different from normal, though, and fits well 
with the volatility switching model.

EBS' D.C. office.  It is likely that he will work for me on the EBS side but 
will live in D.C.  I will finalize that later.   Vince had mentioned that it 
is okay with him as long as it is okay with you. So please double check with 
Vince on this. 

I suggest the following transition:

Start date in D.C.   May 1, 2000

From now till the start date, Michael will slowly transition into my group

1025,"Hi  John and Vince   I had an opportunity to review the slide  presentation 
of  EP   and  here is my
assessment.  Bottom  line:   Too  robust by 2005  on merchant plants  being 
built; up and running  baseload  and
too optimistic  about offshore   gas volume   growth by 2005  as well.

WESTERN MARKETS
EP forecast  is  way too high  by  2005 by their assuming 1.4 BCFD of new 
power generation gas  demand
could be in place in the  west  in such a short  time..This means ..they may 
be  forgetting to consider  the tough
 NIMBY   siting  hurdles  that stalled  all  but  550 MW  of the  current   
10,000 mw of planned  capacity  in the  West.....EP is  assuming not  only  
do  80 percent of  these planned plants  get  built  but then they l run  
baseload...which is
very unlikely. Most  shall be   peaking  or intermediate load in the start 
years  which trims that gas use by 50 to 85 percent.
WEFA  and   ENE Corp. thinks  the  area gas use growth will be   more like  
3.2/  2.9 BCFD  BY 2010 --  but 80 percent of  this  gas  use  happening  
late -- not early -- in the time period out  to   2010.  I foresee  the EP 
scenario as unrealistic given NIMBY and enviro siting limitations short term 
in the West. 

WEST  SO CENTRAL  TX/LA  

EP  sees the  area  at   2.7 bcfd  by 2005;   way too high  compared  to  
WEFA  and  ENE   at   -400 mmcfd  and  +500 mmcfd, respectively BY 2010   
and  even  prematurely  high by PIRA's  robust   standard  of   3.5 bcfd  by 
2010 .
EP  like PIRA assumes   the  gas thermal demand  stays on even  as merchant  
plants  get  built;  ENE and
WEFA  assume  merchant  kwhs and lower variable costs and better heat  rates  
shut in the thermals or  cause them to be  repowered  as combined cycles.  
Given where EP's  pipes  are located in the  West  and Texas  and up the 
Northeast  this  demand scenario  fits  their wants...so I can see why they 
like  this scenario  but   it assumes power generators  will not  act  
economically rationally.

NORTHEAST
EP sees  2.7 bcfd  by 2005  vs WEFA, PIRA and  ENE   seeing   2.3/2.5/2..6  
bcfd  by 2010 .Way premature  for this area to  see such growth  as  385 
mmcfd  annually.  They  are real robust on  offshore  gas  being there  to  
fill this need too.

GAS  SUPPLY
Offshore  supply, which  has  fallen   2.4    bcfd   since    1995   is 
expected  to  grow in EP's  forecast  by  3.6  bcfd  by 2005...extremely   
unlikely  given the slow  start  Shell  and  Texaco and Exxon offshore   has  
been  showing  us so far.  I was  burned  in  my  supply analysis  work in  
1999  by Shell's  forecasts of their   adding  alone   2  bcfd  to  offshore  
deliverability  by  2000  which never  happened --  it fell  500mmcfd  
instead !!  so  I do not   give  a lot of  hope right now   for 3.6 bcfd 
incremental  gas  by 2005  per  EP.  Cambridge  Energy  says  if all goes  
well  the Offshore  overall  will be up  1.1- 1.7  bcfd  by  2005..way less  
than  EP  is showing.

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

1088,"As most of you know, in a last ditch attempt, we are trying to develop a 
complete ""solution"" to the California problems that can be presented in the 
Sec of Treasury discussions.  It would be very helpful if people would 
comment or provide analysis on the likelihood of the following settlement 
points:  

1. Long-Term Contracting
key need of CA is NEW POWER PLANTS - KEY MESSAGE - AND IT'S IN CALIFORNIA'S 
AUTHORITY TO DELIVER
Live Auction conducted by DEALBENCH
auction should be focused on ""build"" economics
parties bid ($/Mwh) for the right to deliver 500+ MW (the right size needs to 
be determined) into Cal ISO control area for 5 years and the winning bidder 
obtains a pre-approved generation site in California (with all permits, 
siting obligations, and interconnection - BIG ISSUE) to build starting within 
2 months
focusing on just delivered energy without generation site is difficult to 
price (market too illiquid)
keep the number of auctions to a minimum (probably 6 - 10) for each utility
Counterparty is State of California (some agency)
maybe structure the bids to be 50-50 baseload vs. peaking

2. Utility Retail Ratemaking
per RELIANT ENERGY model, need $85/Mwh on average to work within retail 
framework (how much would rate increase does this create?)
goal must be to have EBITDA positive utilities, although long-term utilities 
should be EBITDA = $0 for generation sales
keep the current PX structure? 
Utilities may have to ""eat"" some of the current undercollection

3. Interim Credit Support
pro rata credit from all creditors (including banks and energy suppliers)
60 day forbearance (to allow the auction to occur)

4. Liability 
PG&E, SDG&E, and SCE agree not to sue any suppliers
State of California considers ""taking"" all civil cases and not pursuing
State of California agrees not to pursue any criminal cases

5. Other Actions
FERC agrees to immediate price cap lifting
FERC and California agree to complete non-stakeholder board for ISO
CPUC immediately finds that the result of the auction is ""reasonable""


The key point is to (1) stop the current bleeding by getting long-term deals 
in place soon and (2) manage the rate shock.  We will be working three things 
(1) structure of the long-term auction, (2) rate model showing how high 
prices of long-term auction power can be, and (3) financial results for

 Per your request, I have prepared the following summary.

Western RTO Development:

RTO West.
Area to be included -- WA, OR, ID, MT, Western WY, UT, NV-North & South and 
hopefully Canada (BC Hydro and possibly Alberta)
Filed with FERC ""Stage 1"" documents in October 2000 -- Governance, Bylaws, 
Draft of Operating Agreement, etc.
Stage 2 development begun January 2001 with of complete proposal in July 2001
Earliest practical operation Fall 2002 (optimistic based on quick on approval 
time)
Plan Quality -- Good overall 
Attractive Features -- independent board, single control area and real time 
voluntary energy market, all parties on same tariff, a tradeable transmission 
right with ""use or lose"" anti-hoarding provisions.
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to 
existing users for a ten year period (""use or lose"" will mitigate for short 
term rights but long term rights on existing system will be tough to get).
Desert STAR.
Area to be included -- AZ, NM, CO, Eastern WY
Governance established and Board has been organized.
Have not yet filed a complete plan 
Earliest practical operation Winter 2002 or beyond, depending on when they 
actually file their proposal
Plan quality --  Potentially promising
Attractive Features -- similar transmission right regime as RTO West
Unknown -- whether they will have a single control area, whether 
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to 
existing users, board selection committee was manipulated by publics (however 
in practice the independent board selected seems to have been little affected 
by the search firm nomination process)
CA-ISO.
Area included -- CA IOU's only
Fully operational but with CA/FERC jurisdictional struggle over Board 
appointment and independence.
Modifications to meet Order 2000 have been filed which appear to move 
transmission rights close to the proposals under discussion in RTO West and 
Desert STAR


Cooperative Regional Organization Activity:

Seams.
A joint task force of parties involved in RTO West, Desert STAR and CA-ISO 
began meeting in November 2000
Three major seams issues identified and work begun
Scheduling time lines -- aligning processes between three RTOs so that 
business across seams boundaries is not hampered for administrative reasons.
Nature of transmission rights and effect on loop flow -- making the 
congestion management systems work between the three RTOs.
Export fees -- goal is to eliminate pancaking of fixed cost charges between 
RTOs, perhaps by annual transfer payments between RTOs or some other 
reciprocity agreement.
RTG Consolidation.  
WRTA. SWRTA and WSCC voted to merge in to a single organization, the WIO 
(Western Interconnection Organization)
WIO will have three committee:   Planning, Operations, Market Interface.  
The Northwest organization (NRTA) has decided to stay independent for now, 
but if RTO West forms it may just disappear as a separate organization. 

If you need more detail, please let me know.

1093,"Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms 


(Published April 4, 2001) 
There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that 
envelops California's energy crisis. 
Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control 
and the die is more or less cast. Whatever fate decrees - massive summer 
blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's 
utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov. Gray Davis downward are 
scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals 
for blame. 
No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very 
apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with 
energy and moved to other matters. Legislative committees are working on the 
hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special 
committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis 
have gone into semihibernation. 
Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears 
that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will 
backfire. ""Just remember Jimmy Carter,"" state Controller Kathleen Connell 
warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have ""no excuses"" for 
perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly. ""We will be 
accountable on Election Day 2002,"" she said. 
Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a 
second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined 
sharply in recent weeks. He devoted much of the weekend to defending his 
actions, saying, ""I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this 
problem,"" and trying to pin blame on Republicans. 
Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape 
from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses 
in the last three elections. The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder, 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of 
mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill 
Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis 
Davis. 
The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every 
sign of worsening. Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled 
""Meeting the Energy Challenge"" to defend the governor's actions, it's 
apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit. 
The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power 
purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into 
a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves. The 
long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases 
have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for 
them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float. 
Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase 
market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a 
deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit. 
Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the 
state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall 
Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power 
generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission 
grid have stalled, perhaps permanently. 
The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the 
specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air 
conditioners or medical equipment shut down. And the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis. 
Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy. With 
Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to 
protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

N33580.DTL 
Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other 
alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a 
proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening. 
A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward 
energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates. 
Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which 
would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who 
requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities 
that buy their power return to solvency. 
Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for 
not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or 
""QFs"" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates. 
""It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the 
money designed to compensate the QFs,"" Davis said. ""It's immoral and has to 
stop."" 
Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil 
refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's 
supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not 
paid them since November. 
The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers 
contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday, 
according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power 
grid. 
The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday 
meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. 
The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more 
than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor 
one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings 
from other creditors. 
The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work. 
""It is critical to keep these facilities up and online,"" said Sen. Debra 
Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash 
on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. ""The utilities owe it to the people of the 
state to pay them."" 
Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative 
producers ahead of their other creditors. 
But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes 
alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the 
governor's office about possible payment structures. 
Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural 
gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash 
they must close their plants. 
""We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten 
the health of everyone else,"" said V. John White, legislative director of the 
Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers. 
CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the 
Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility 
asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with 
Edison which has paid them nothing since November. 
CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes 
the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day. 
""We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in 
a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest 
employer in the county,"" said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager. 
Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar. 
""We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet 
delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs 
to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen 
rates,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. 
The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators 
comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for 
legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations 
eventually failed to move forward.

Energy Boss Says State Summer Blackouts 'Appear Inevitable' 
Carolyn Lochhead, Chronicle Washington Bureau

0965.DTL 
Washington -- The Bush administration warned yesterday that blackouts ""appear 
inevitable"" in California this summer, but it firmly rebuffed a deal from 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein that would force the state to lift its rate freeze on 
consumers in exchange for federal controls on wholesale prices. 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham insisted that price controls would make 
shortages worse by reducing power sales into the state. The administration's 
top priority is to prevent blackouts, he said. 
""Let me make one point clear,"" Abraham told the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee. ""Any action we take must either help increase supply or 
reduce demand. . . . Price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand. In 
fact, in our view, they will seriously aggravate the supply crisis."" 
Abraham said electricity shortages in California ""will get worse, and 
blackouts this summer appear inevitable."" He cited projections of anywhere 
from 20 to 200 hours of rolling outages this summer. 
""I'm not saying that people in California don't want lower energy costs,"" he 
said. ""But I know for sure they don't want to be sitting this summer without 
electricity at all. And our goal is to try to avoid that as the primary 
public interest responsibility of this administration."" 
Feinstein became the first leading state Democrat to break with Gov. Gray 
Davis in calling for an end to the rate freeze that has kept electricity 
prices low for California consumers, even as soaring wholesale costs have 
driven the state's investor-owned utilities to bankruptcy and now are 
draining the state's budget surplus. 
But Feinstein insisted that the federal government must simultaneously force 
down wholesale prices until ample new power plants come online. 
Feinstein said higher consumer rates would encourage conservation, saying 
that if people just turned off their computers at night, they would save 7 
percent of the state's electricity supply. 
She also said the state, which now is buying electricity for the utilities, 
has already run through $2.7 billion and could spend $10 billion on 
electricity this year. 
""That is gone,"" Feinstein said. ""It doesn't buy a school. It doesn't repair a 
road. It doesn't build the water system many of us believe the state needs."" 
The offer came as a compromise with Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith, who 
warned that an ""economic and environmental catastrophe"" awaits the Western 
states this summer when electricity demand is expected to soar while a 
drought in the Northwest constricts the supply of hydroelectric power. 
Smith's move to embrace price controls, which he had earlier rejected, 
reflected sharply intensifying political pressure on the Bush administration 
to intervene in the electricity market, as Western officials complained 
bitterly yesterday that rising energy prices are forcing layoffs and now 
threaten the region's economy. 
LESSONS OF SUPPLY, DEMAND
""I'm afraid this summer we're going to be in the middle of a dry lakebed 
explaining to very angry farmers and homeowners and former factory workers 
the lessons of supply and demand,"" said Smith, whose family owns a frozen 
vegetables business. ""I don't want to send the wrong signals to the 
marketplace . . . but I'll tell you, the wrong signal is a recession."" 
Abraham repeatedly sought to counter criticism that the Bush administration 
is not doing enough to aid the West, citing a letter he sent to Davis 
yesterday that said the White House will not oppose the state's plan to take 
over the investor-owned utilities' transmission lines, despite disagreeing 
with the approach. 
""Regrettably, I think our opposition to price caps has been claimed by some 
to suggest that the administration either does not care about California and 
the West or is doing nothing to help,"" Abraham said. ""That is simply untrue."" 
Abraham said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's recent order to 13 
power suppliers to refund $69 million in January overcharges to the utilities 
would send ""a signal that companies that exploit a serious situation aren't 
going to get away with it."" 
He also cited expedited federal approvals and waivers for power plants and 
discussions with Mexico to try to increase electricity exports from Baja to 
California. 
But Abraham firmly rejected price caps, saying they ""have already been tried 
and already failed"" in California when a price ceiling for electricity sales 
into the state was reduced over the past year from $750 a megawatt hour to 
$150. 
RESULTS OF PRICE CAPS
""The lower the price cap was set, the higher average electricity prices 
rose,"" Abraham said, in part because municipal utilities were exempt. New 
federal price caps would affect just half of the Western electricity market, 
he said, and so would shift supplies from regulated to unregulated markets 
rather than control prices. 
He also said price caps would ""almost certainly"" reduce sales from Mexico and 
Canada and induce ""cheating and circumvention."" 
Armed with charts showing huge wholesale price increases over the past year, 
Feinstein expressed her strong disappointment. 
""Oh, Mr. Secretary,"" Feinstein said, ""I was really surprised by the ideologic 
hardness of your statement. I must tell you that."" 
She said California will be 5,000 megawatts short of electricity this summer, 
enough power for 5 million homes. ""It's a lot of shortness,"" she said, 
predicting that prices will reach $5,000 a megawatt hour. ""What does 
California do about that if it isn't going to get any help to provide that 
stability and reliability over that period of time? . . . All we're asking 
for is help to prevent price-gouging."" 
Abraham countered that the administration's position is ""common sense."" 
""I'm telling you, I think this summer, if California has worse blackouts than 
currently projected, that (price caps) would have been a disservice to the 
people of your state,"" Abraham said. ""If the rest of the West finds the 
Canadian energy providers refusing to sell at the same levels because of 
price caps . . . that's in my judgment an irresponsible carrying out of our 
public responsibilities here."" 
In Sacramento, Davis said he was ""particularly grateful"" for the 
administration's promise not to oppose the state transmission takeover. He 
also said the state would ""have just enough power to avoid blackouts"" but 
said ""federal officials are of a different view."" 
Still, the governor continued to urge ''some effort to temper wholesale 
prices.""

Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said. 
""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. ""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with ""moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy.""

California Stiffs Gore's Hatchet Men  

California's state controller, Democrat Kathleen Connell,  says she won't 
sign any checks for those $30,000-a-month Gore hatchet men hired  by bumbling 
Gov. Gray Davis to try to blame others for the state's energy  fiasco.  

""I would like assurance that their work is directly related to solving  
California's energy crisis and not the political strategy that [Mark] 
Fabiani  and [Chris] Lehane have built a reputation for through their work at 
the White  House,"" Connell said, Fox News reported today.  

Connell says she supports a lawsuit filed Monday in Sacramento by Lewis  
Uhler, president of National Tax Limitation Committee, to block ""consultant""  
fees to the two former advisers to failed presidential candidate Al Gore.  

""They have a conflict of interest that may be terminal to their employment,""  
Uhler said. ""These are clearly not electricity experts. Their background  
suggests they have been hired to be damage control folks for a beleaguered  
governor.""","Gore Kathleen Connell Gray Davis Mark Connell Lewis

1108,"Mark:  just a ""heads up"" that we may be called to react to this attached 
NYMERX press release since Enron added the provisions they oppose in the 
release.  H.R. 4541 passed the House 377-4 last evening and Enron strongly 
supports the legislation (I will e-mail Ken Lay's letter to Chairman Combest 
which expresses our support plus some talking points for your information.)  
There is a real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress.  The 
last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm (he is the only 
obstacle to enactment in the Senate.)  The ""Energy Provisions"" discussed in 
this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate.  It 
is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being 
negotiated.

Contrary to this release's statement, no House member (other than one member 
who didn't make it for the vote,Congressman Baker) is asking for changes in 
the Senate.  The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves.  All and all, 
this press release is outlandish.

This will be our highest priority next week and changes occur by the hour.  
Please call if you do indeed get press calls and need our assistance.  Many 
thanks.


EXCHANGE EXPRESSES OUTRAGE AT HOUSE PASSAGE OF H.R. 4541

NEW YORK, NY, October 20, 2000 -- In response to passage by the House of
Representatives last night of H.R. 4541, the Commodity Futures
Modernization Act of 2000, New York Mercantile Exchange Chairman Daniel
Rappaport issued the following statement:

      The New York Mercantile Exchange finds it particularly egregious
that, by approving subsection (g) (3) of Section 106, the House would
not only remove the energy and metals marketplaces from public scrutiny
and regulatory oversight, but also do this in a fashion that
discriminates between established markets versus start-up electronic
forums.

It is particularly outrageous, at a time when every U.S. consumer is
feeling the impact of high energy prices, to allow lobbying by a small
group of vested interests to influence Congress to take these markets
out of the public eye and create an advantage for people to trade on
private, proprietary systems lacking the protections of a neutral
self-regulatory organization. Policy makers, regulators, and the
American public will be deprived of currently available information on
market participation, concentration, and financial performance.

This is not only a matter of ill-conceived public policy but is also
anti-competitive and directly contrary to the recommendations made by
the President'sWorking Group on financial markets.

Even House members who voted in favor of the bill have been publicly
quoted as saying that it must be changed in the Senate.

The New York Mercantile Exchange plans to fight adamantly at the Senate
level to demand that this subsection either be eliminated or be amended
to create a consistent regulatory policy for electronic and open outcry
markets.

USA: UPDATE 1-Energy casts some light in gloomy profit season.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third-quarter results on Monday and Tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years. 
Technology bellwethers Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which reported sharply lower profits, did little to buck the downward trend.
FirstEnergy Corp. , an owner of electric utilities in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 18 percent increase in earnings, citing increased electricity sales and lower costs. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production. 
Yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Top chipmaker Intel said on Tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales. PC maker IBM announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits. 
Energy giant Enron Corp. posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc. , the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp. , a computer company. 
""The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point,"" said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund. 
FOCUS NOT ON EARNINGS 
""The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically,"" he said. 
Dynegy Inc. , a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. 
""Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down,"" said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. ""These are good, well-financed companies."" 
Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. 
The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. 
Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. 
TAKING GRIM TIDINGS IN STRIDE 
Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc. , a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp. , the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. 
Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. 
""Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks,"" said Burnham. ""Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months."" 
""Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse,"" he said. 
This week is the busiest for earnings with 15 Dow Jones industrial average and 180 Standard & Poor's 500 Index companies scheduled to report. 
Profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22.8 percent, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991. That's down from an expected 6.2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter, and a 14.7 percent drop expected on Sept. 10, said First Call analyst Joe Cooper. 
Some 85 S&P 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results. Of these, 50 companies have beaten the most recent, often lowered Wall Street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts.

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron says may partner or sell broadband business.

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss-making broadband telecommunications business, which could involve selling the business or finding a partner. 
""In addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business, we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Earlier on Tuesday, Enron reported that one-time charges of $1.01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in more than four years. 
Future options for the broadband business include ""sale, partnership, all kinds of possibilities"" he said. 
""We still think over time that it will be a valuable business,"" Lay said, but for now the broadband market is in a ""total meltdown"", he added. 
Enron's broadband unit, which owns an 18,000 mile network, posted a loss of $80 million for the third quarter, but Lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters. 
Enron launched its broadband business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential and has scaled down its operations. 
Enron's stock rose by 87 percent last year, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured, CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. 
Enron shares on Tuesday closed up 67 cents, or 2.02 percent, at $33.84.

USA: UPDATE 6-Enron posts loss after taking $1 bln in charges.
By C. Bryson Hull

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses. 
Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.
""What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. 
Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. 
Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. 
The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM. 
Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. 
""They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield,"" said Meade. 
Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. 
ILL-FATED BUSINESSES 
Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. 
The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. 
Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. 
Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential. 
Enron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
The company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002. 
DEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW 
Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. The writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent. 
The division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000. 
All of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year. 
The European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility. 
The latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations. 
In doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent. Many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent
of Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)

     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter after
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost the company $1.01 billion.

     The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred
dividends, Enron said. Net income a year earlier was $292 million,
or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.

     Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year on
concern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gas
pipelines. Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman
and chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of the
new businesses. Others said they're not confident all the bad news
is out.

     ``What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,''
said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris Insight
Equity Fund. ``If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, it
doesn't mean there aren't more.''

     Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in the
past year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEO
in August. Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas-
pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, said
he left for personal reasons. Investors said they weren't
confident Enron was detailing all its problems.

                         Failed Businesses

     The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, are
equal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over the
past four quarters.

     Included were $544 million for losses on investments in New
Power Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. and
International Business Machines Corp. New Power competes for
energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and
gas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.

     The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unit
that trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, as
well as for the ``early termination of certain structured finance
arrangements'' with an undisclosed ``entity.'' Enron wouldn't be
more specific.

     Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would cost
another $180 million, including severance pay to 500 fired
workers. The business collapsed this year along with the fortunes
of the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off its
biggest customers.

     The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., its
water and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enron
said.

     Enron might take a first-quarter ``adjustment'' of less than
$200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill,
Lay said in an interview. ``If we thought there were any other
significant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,''
Lay said.

                         Excluding Losses

     Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43
cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period. That
matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent
for the past year. Its wholesale services business, which includes
energy trading, had income before interest, minority interests and
taxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.
     Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84. Earlier, the stock
had risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.

     ``There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, its
energy merchant businesses, are OK,'' said Roger Hamilton, who
helps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.

     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.

                     `Ridiculous Investments'

     At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that
contributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.

     Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water,
from which Azurix emerged. Enron sold shares to the public in
1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurix
failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning
large projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North
American business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.

     In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become the
company's fastest-growing business. In the latest quarter, the
bandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests and
taxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.

Revenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.

     ``You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was for
the best,'' John Hancock's Hamilton said. ``Under him, they built
the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous
investments.''

     While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied more
information this quarter about how it makes money. The company
gave results of individual commodity-trading desks, including
coal, forest products and steel.

     ``I liked that they broke out the different commodities,''
Hamilton said. ``I think Lay has gotten the message loud and
clear, and that the effort is there.''

Online Niche Players Capitalize on Natural-Gas Shortage, Bypass Utilities
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

SmartEnergy, a Con Edison competitor, is offering New York and Westchester
consumers price protection with the ability to lock-in today's natural-gas
rates for a period of one year. In a separate announcement, myHomeKey.com
announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce
energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising
energy costs.

ANALYSIS: As reports continue to accumulate that a natural-gas shortage
will send prices skyrocketing this winter (see my IssueAlert from Oct.
9 on the subject), the most common response from electric utilities has
been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next
few months. I can point to several examples. Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy
announced a few weeks back that its natural-gas customers could face heatin=
g
bills that are 35 to 50 percent higher than their bills last winter. Domini=
on
East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to
pay about $70 more per month for natural gas from November through January.
And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeast=01*where
low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every year=01*but in the West
as well. In California, PG&E warns that its customers can expect to see
their winter bills increase by about $25, to an average bill of $75 (compar=
ed
to $50 last winter). These are just a few examples of utility companies
across the United States playing damage control, trying to minimize the
customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple.

Along with their warnings, these utilities give reasons=01*perhaps seen as
excuses by the public=01*for the rising cost of energy. There is a shortage
of natural gas across the country, brought about by a drop-off in productio=
n.
It was an unusually hot summer, which depleted supplies for energy. Demand
in general has grown to surprising levels.

Meanwhile, start-up online companies that many of us have not even heard
of are using the rise in natural-gas prices as a golden marketing opportuni=
ty,
and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies.
SmartEnergy is a perfect example. In existence just since April 1999,
SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small
business customers. According to EnergyGuide.com, for an average home in
New York City, SmartEnergy's natural-gas rates typically have run about
$189 per month, compared Con Edison's $140. Under its new promotion,=20
SmartEnergy's
plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas
customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current
natural-gas rates for the next 12 months. This promotion comes at an ideal
time for those who opt to switch, as natural-gas prices should begin their
projected sharp increase over the next few weeks. Based on recent forecasts=
,
SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can
expect to save up to 40 percent on their energy through the winter months.
The start-up company also is offering 500 United Airlines Mileage Plus
Reward Miles credit and $25 sign-up bonus to entice customers away from
Con Edison.

Based on the available information about SmartEnergy, it is unclear how
the online provider will be able to guarantee the 40-percent reduction
in natural-gas rates. I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into
some hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that natural-gas
prices remain high into the next year. Any prudent provider would have
a hedging strategy to protect itself, and locking itself into 12-month
contracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot marke=
t
prices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy.
In addition, SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away
from Con Edison and other utility providers. Many customers still have
reservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know.
There will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current
rates for 12 months, but many others will stick with the company that they
know even if their rates increase.

I did a quick search around Con Edison's Website to see if it might be
offering an alternative offer to retain its customers, but could find nothi=
ng
that the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase
in natural-gas prices this winter. Con Edison does offer a level billing
program in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month,
alleviating fluctuation in their bills. Yet, as a utility company, Con
Edison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor.
It is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer
service, which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public
Service Commission. The PSC could agree, or determine that the competitive
offers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of=20
deregulation.
In addition, Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not
allow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates. Overall, Con
Edison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates
it can charge customers, thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficu=
lt
to beat.

The other online start-up taking advantage of natural-gas prices is=20
myHomeKey.com,
which made a recent promise to reduce home heating, oil, natural-gas, and
electricity rates. The marketing route that this online start-up is taking
is energy efficiency=01*teaching households how to more effectively use the=
ir
energy and, hopefully, save money as a result. Energy is not the only servi=
ce
of the myHomeKey.com; it is also involved in home maintenance and repair,
appliances, home monitoring and moving services. Yet, I learned that=20
myHomeKey.com
just recently launched co-branded sites with KeySpan Corp. and TXU Energy
Services to ""provide millions of local customers"" with the ability to check
energy efficiency in their homes.

What's important to note about these two developments is the advantage
that online energy providers have over traditional utilities. As utilities
try to disengage themselves from regulatory-bound rate structures, online
companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products
and billing options to customers in deregulated states. There are the onlin=
e
providers that we know about, such as Utility.com and Essential.com.=20
Utility.com
has not yet started to sell natural gas, although it has established a
partnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell
natural gas in deregulated markets via the Utility.com Web site. Utility.co=
m
plans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year, but it has
not developed any marketing campaign in this regard. Essential.com continue=
s
to open up its service across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Yet,
on a weekly basis, new start-up online energy providers surface, eager
to grab their own share of the retail market.

I also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to capital=
ize
on the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in natural-gas prices.
It would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own
marketing efforts, as it already promises lower prices for both natural
gas and electricity. In any event, as the natural-gas shortage may become
a public relations nightmare for utility companies across the country,
it conversely could work to the advantage of the more agile online provider=

I think I already forward these to you, but if not, they're the prices that 
Henderson came up with for fully shaped prices to the utilities.  May be 
useful re: conversations with the Street about getting the utilities out of 
procurement.  Note that the date on the prices is 10.02.00 so they're 
somewhat stale, but arguably still indicative.  I'm also going to give you 
the prices Belden just gave us (prior to the run up yesterday, though) for

1125,"I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today.  House 
hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate 
hearing was on last week's FERC order on a ""soft price cap"" and related 
issues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal 
Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation 
Implementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from the 
Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the 
three FERC commissioners.

HIghlights

Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton 
bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will 
happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will 
report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); 
Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.
There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that 
higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate 
increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation 
costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at 
the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical 
conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as 
it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country 
attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.
The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, 
attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism 
was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high 
price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell 
it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus 
sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their 
strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA 
testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region 
to support sec. 102.
Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a 
price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among 
the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could 
be done; the witnesses just said ""cost plus a reasonable profit"" and said 
leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had 
the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would 
take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last 
week's soft price cap is much better.
Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to 
admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT 
have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken 
recently. 
The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it 
was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when 
Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that ""help is on the way"" in the form 
of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that 
suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern 
came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat 
contentious at times.

A Deserved Downgrade, ( EDITORIAL)

1130,"Commencing with an NHK (Japanese public TV) report and quickly spreading to 
media inquiries and wire reports, earlier today a story spread through Japan 
that the Enron affiliate E Power has immediate plans to build at least one 
large (1000 MW) power plant.   In fact,  it appears that E Power has been 
pursuing this prospect, but nothing has progressed to executive management or 
board approval.   We are using the following statement to respond to media 
inquiries:


Enron and its affiliates, including E Power, continuously look at a number of 
projects around the world.  There is a good deal of advance preparation and 
various factors that need to be evaluated before these projects can progress 
forward through approvals.  Therefore, it is Enron's practice not to comment 
on these projects until they reach a sufficiently advanced stage of 
development to have a significant prospect for success.  Enron and/or E Power 
do not have a power project in Japan which is sufficiently advanced to 
warrant comment at this time.

We will keep you apprised of further significant developments.

1133,"As the individual responsible within Enron Corp. for coordinating the 
analysis of regulatory transfer restriction issues in the above-referenced 
project, I wanted to give each of you a brief update, but more importantly, 
ask for your help in ensuring, as we move closer to the signing date, that we 
are fully coordinated on these issues and are prepared to act in a consistent 
and coordinated fashion across the regions as quickly as possible.

Over the last several weeks, the regional general counsel offices, V&E (Bill 
Weiland), Skadden and myself have been talking to local counsel across the 
regions to make sure that we fully understand all of the regulatory transfer 
issues and that we also fully understand the implications of the regulatory 
transfer restrictions in the context of the ""ABC"" deal structure.  We have 
now largely completed that process and the conclusions reached during that 
process have been memorialized in various documents, including the ""ABC 
Matrix"" that many, if not all of you, have seen.  All that is remaining is 
confirmation on a South Korean competition agency issue and the completion of 
the analysis relative to the Wind assets in Europe regarding EU competition 
agency issues. Those two items should be completed by early next week.  We 
have also recently begun the process of preparing documents that will be 
necessary for the approval of the transfer of Elektro in Brazil...which 
brings me to the second issue, coordination and preparation.

Having reached a critical juncture with the completition of virtually all of 
the regulatory analysis, the next step is to plan for the announcement of the 
transaction...more specifically, ensuring that regulatory/governmental 
communication assignments for both pre and post announcement are fully agreed 
upon and understood by all... and that the process of drafting the necessary 
requests for regulatory approval documents is agreed upon and begun as soon 
as possible.  To ensure that this all happens in a timely manner and with 
quality, I would like to request that one individual from each operating 
region and company be assigned as the point person so that I can have a 
single individual within each operating unit to go to that has the authority 
to put together the comprehensive regulatory transfer plan and the 
responsibility for assuring the execution of the plan, both during the 
periods of time leading up to signing and announcement and during the 
transition period leading up to closing.  I would respectfully ask that the 
names of these individuals be communicated to me by close of business 
Wednesday, August 16, 2000 to provide us sufficient time to address the work 
that lies before us.  I have taken the liberty of listing my suggestions for 
the responsible individuals (where I have suggestions) for the respective 
operating regions/companies, but these are only suggestions and I will defer 
to your choices.  Thank you for your assistance and if you have any 
questions, feel free to contact me at extension 33407 in Houston or by pager 
at 888-740-9949.

 From Sivy's mailbox

Here are my answers to recent e-mails about tech, telecom, John Malone and
junk bonds.

By Michael Sivy

I've been receiving a lot of e-mail lately about both the election and the
carnage in tech stocks, and it's hard to say which upsets readers more. The
one thing that seems fairly certain is that neither is over yet.

The Florida Supreme Court may force a decision on the election before
Thanksgiving -- or the legal wrangling may continue for several weeks.
Either way, we're looking at gridlock in Washington. That means the surplus
will balloon, as increases in government spending and tax cuts are both
stymied.

The swelling surplus could reduce the outstanding volume of Treasury bonds
by as much as 15 percent over the next couple of years. That would be very
bullish for all high-quality bonds -- Treasury, agency, blue-chip corporate
and municipal. On the other hand, using the surplus to reduce debt instead
of spending it (or returning it to taxpayers who would spend it) would sap
the economy's energy. That could mean more earnings disappointments from
economically sensitive companies over the next couple of months.

In the long run, though, gridlock could lay the foundation for a resumption
of the stock market boom. Debt reduction and an economic slowdown will
probably encourage Fed chairman Alan Greenspan to cut interest rates
substantially next year, which would be a boon to the overall market.

Now here's a look at some specific questions:

What's up with Cisco and Oracle?
The Nasdaq has been getting walloped and is now down 40 percent from its
highs. I've said that the damage to the tech sector isn't over and that the
group may not rally as usual going into the new year. Earnings fears are
the chief cause of the selloff. In addition, the most popular tech stocks
on the Nasdaq, such as Cisco and Oracle, carry P/Es as high as 50. I
imagine that there will be a great buying opportunity for these stocks --
but they could get cheaper still.

When are the big telecoms, such as AT&T, WorldCom and Lucent going to come
back?

I've recommended all three of these stocks as value buys (see ""The shining""
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000731.html ] and
""After the tech wreck""
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/001101.html ]).
And though each has since dropped, I still believe each has asset values at
least 50 percent above current share prices. But in this environment, they
probably won't rebound quickly. If I already owned them, I'd certainly hold
them. And I'd consider buying now, though there's no rush. Lucent looks
like the most straightforward play, followed by WorldCom. AT&T presents the
most potential problems.

What's going on with Liberty Media and why can't I find the ticker symbol?

I've recommended Liberty Media Group a couple of times (see ""The media
master is back"" [
http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000927.html ] and
""Leader of the free world"" [
http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/001110.html ]).
Since AT&T acquired cable TV giant TCI, Liberty's programming operations
have traded as an AT&T tracking stock with the symbol LMG, class A. On some
quote systems, the symbol is given as LMGa, on others as LMG_A. If you
can't find it, try the MONEY.COM Website, where the stock is LMG.A [LMG.A].

To my mind, the case for Liberty is the case for John Malone. He was the
master of the industry back when he was CEO of TCI, but he nearly
disappeared from view after the acquisition. Now with the spotlight back on
Liberty, Malone has the chance to be a player again, particularly since
AT&T has announced that it intends to spin off Liberty as an independent
company.

If the slowing economy is bullish for bonds, why is my high-yield bond fund
down almost 10 percent?

The slowing economy and the prospect for lower interest rates are extremely
bullish for bonds of unquestioned financial strength. Junk bonds suffer in
an economy slowdown, however, because investors worry that the companies'
chances of default will increase. If you own a junk mutual fund, though,
I'd hang on at this point (I have a junk fund too and I'm down nearly 10
percent). The worst of the decline is most likely behind us, and junk bonds
can rally powerfully after an economic slowdown ends.

1178,"Here are a few alternatives to handling Lal Echterhoff's situation:

(1)  We give cash difference in black-scholes value between one year and three year options calculated as of the termination date of 5/31/01.  The analysis isn't very pretty:  the total difference for all affected shares (165,000) is only $1652.  These options are so far in the money that the time value is de minimus.

 
(2)  We could have them cancel their old options and purchase on the open market some options with longer terms.  The lowest strike price available for January 04 leaps is $30 and the term still isn't quite long enough - most affected options have a strike price between $15 and $20.  This alternative would need tax, accounting, and SEC research and would cost about $4mm in total.

(3)  We could just purchase January 04 leaps with a strike price of $50 and not ask them to cancel their old options - this would cost aobut $2.2mm.  Still a problem with term not syncing with their old options, but it would give them the opportunity to ""double-dip"" in value if the stock ran up between now and May 31, 2002.

***************

If you would like me to do any further due diligence on any of the three above, let me know.

I still recommend the previously drafted email to Lal reiterating that the plan provisions prevail.  Morally, it may not be correct, but it would take an exorbitant amount of ""feel-good"" and money to get any further improvements in our ranking as the best place to work; Everyone knows what Enron is when they come here and we're very open about it.  We are efficiently Darwinistic, not feel-good-anything-you-want.  I don't think we should apologize to those who don't read their agreements or plan documents or the fine print (the caveats were there).

I do feel bad that this happened, and we should make sure the right people sign-off on this sort of thing in the future.

While we were looking at opportunities for Offline and the value proposition a potential software vendor might make to banks, we stumbled across 
""Asset Backed Securities"" and its complete lack of market making.    It appears to be a very large market, controlled by ""dealers"" who control issuance
of ABS commercial paper, and among themselves control an informal secondary market.   

Given the size of the market, and the players who seek to issue the paper (GE, Siemen, Ford, credit card companies, etc.), I was curious as to how Enron would
view the opportunity.   My original intention for this piece was to talk to a bank or two about how they might use our system to do this themselves and 
outmanuever the ""controlling dealers"".

Also a firm has opened for business that purports to bypass the ""issuance process"" at a much lower cost, but has no way to help a secondary market
along.  If we could work with them on a ""secondary market"", perhaps this could evolve.

We have had some positive feedback from Rahil, Brandon, and Tom Gros  but I thought you might provide an overall corporate view!

1189,"The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission m=
eeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence g=
athered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will requ=
ire sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  Al=
l California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, w=
ill be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of t=
heir use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric faciliti=
es will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr)=20

Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price =
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in t=
he ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a partici=
pating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid=
 its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas=
 costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be the avera=
ge daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions are t=
o be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and emissions will be pub=
lished the day after, for use on the following day.  A single market cleari=
ng price is determined in real time for all generators.  Highest bid sets t=
he clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with FERC and the IS=
O, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating uni=
t.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each gene=
rator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event a generator=
 submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, within 7 da=
ys of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying=
 its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs in real =
time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to justify =
bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no oppo=
rtunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.

Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entiti=
es must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be=
 curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.=
  (24-7) =20

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced=
 outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC.=
=20

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June =
1 or Order lapses with no further effect.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how=
 things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are d=
ue in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based ra=
te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withh=
old of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate b=
idding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the =
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit=
 behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be =
inappropriate.  In addition, ""hockey stick"" bids are expressly prohibited (=
i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).

Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  Ref=
und conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a co=
ntrol area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when =
this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be just=
ified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell c=
ontractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within =
WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  Comme=
nts are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective dat=
e is 60 days from publication of the Order.

Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit =
is prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fine=
s does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as pa=
rt of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generat=
ion would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining pr=
ice. =20

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) wheth=
er FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an esc=
row account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have o=
n the PG&E bankruptcy filing. =20

No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from Cal=
ifornia.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of the=
 foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will ke=

WRAP: Dynegy Terminates Troubled Merger Pact With Enron

11/28/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) terminated its troubled merger agre=
ement with Enron Corp. (ENE), backing away from the deal despite frantic la=
st-minute attempts by both sides to save it.=20
Dynegy Wednesday cited Enron's breaches of representations, warranties, con=
venants and agreements, including the material adverse change provision.
The announcement came after Standard & Poor's cut the beleaguered energy tr=
ader's debt rating to B-minus, essentially rendering it to junk status.=20
The downgrade triggered financial covenants and raised the possibility that=
 Enron will be forced to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the federa=
l bankruptcy code. That could be a fatal blow for Enron, which needs huge s=
ums of cheap money to keep its trading operations alive.=20
Standard & Poor's lowered its long-term rating on Enron to B-minus from tri=
ple-B-minus, citing fears that Dynegy would abandon its proposed purchase o=
f Enron.=20
The collapse of the Dynegy purchase would create enormous pressure on Enron=
's credit profile because of Enron's limited access to capital at a time wh=
en extensive debt restructuring is necessary, S&P said.=20
""While it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties, =
this doesn't reflect a failure for the energy merchant business,"" Dynegy sa=
id in announcing its decision.=20
However, Dynegy said its energy delivery network and core businesses are so=
lid, and the company and its industry peers are ready to absorb any added v=
olatility in the energy market as the result of the potential loss of Enron=
.=20
In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down=
 $2.91, or 71%, to $1.20. Dynegy, meanwhile, was down $4.08, or 10%, at $36=
.81, also on the Big Board.=20
Top executives of Enron and Dynegy had tried to salvage a deal to combine t=
he two energy-trading companies amid growing signs that Enron faced cash-fl=
ow problems as a result of a sharp downturn in its core trading business.=
=20
Talks between Enron and Dynegy began in earnest over the weekend to cut the=
 price of the all-stock transaction after Enron's share price had plummeted=
 in the wake of disclosures that its future earnings wouldn't be as high as=
 originally anticipated. Last month Dynegy agreed to buy Enron after the em=
ergence of damaging revelations concerning a series of deals that allowed E=
nron executives to profit personally at the expense of the company and its =
shareholders. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange =
Commission investigation.=20
Citing a person familiar with the situation, The Wall Street Journal said W=
ednesday that Enron's board late Tuesday had informally agreed to a new sha=
re-exchange ratio of 0.12 shares of Dynegy for each Enron share tendered, d=
own more than 50% from the original offer of 0.2685 Dynegy share for each E=
nron share.=20
That latest proposed share-exchange ratio valued Enron at $4.91 a share, or=
 a total of $4.17 billion. That would compare with the original value of $1=
0.98 a share, or $9.33 billion. In exchange for reducing the purchase price=
, some members of the Enron team were insisting on more control over the me=
rged company. Dynegy also was considering an additional $250 million cash i=
nvestment in Enron. Dynegy, together with ChevronTexaco Inc. (CVX), has alr=
eady injected $1.5 billion into Enron in an effort to stabilize the company=
.=20
While struggling to keep the planned merger alive, Enron also has been seek=
ing to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings. Enron has a tot=
al of about $13 billion of debt, of which about $9 billion comes due by the=
 end of next year. Last month Enron said in a filing with the SEC that a cu=
t in its rating to below investment grade by any of the three major credit =
rating agencies - along with a decline in its stock price below certain lev=
els - would trigger the need to repay, refinance or cash collateralize faci=
lities totaling $3.9 billion.=20
Dynegy said Wednesday that it will go through with its acquisition of Enron=
 natural gas pipeline unit Northern Natural, Omaha, Neb., and said it has e=
xercised its right to acquire the unit's common shares.=20
ChevronTexaco, which owns 26% of Dynegy, contributed $1.5 billion to the pr=
oposed Enron merger, and Dynegy used that money to acquire the pipeline uni=
t.=20
Northern Natural, which owns and operates 16,500 miles of interstate natura=
l gas pipeline spanning from the Permian Basin of Texas to the Great Lakes,=
 has historically been a strong earnings contributor.=20
Dynegy said the unit will be a positive addition to Dynegy's own energy del=
ivery network.

Enron's Fall To Spark Volatility On Pwr, Natural Gas Mkts

11/28/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

CALGARY -(Dow Jones)- The potential demise of energy marketing giant Enron =
Corp. spells a drop in liquidity and increased volatility in electricity an=
d natural gas markets across North America, analysts said Wednesday.=20
""There will be an impact on liquidity here in Canada and everywhere because=
 Enron accounted for such a huge volume of trades,"" Denis Lawrence, with Fi=
rstEnergy Capital Corp. said from Calgary.
""Over time, the volumes will come back but it will take some time, in the o=
rder of months,"" he predicted.=20
Stress levels in traders across the country vaulted with the news Wednesday=
 Dynegy Inc. backed out of a proposed US$4.17-billion merger with the belea=
guered Enron, citing the energy trader's breach of representations, warrant=
ies, convenants and agreements.=20
The move came on the back of Standard and Poor's downgrading Enron to junk =
bond status Tuesday. Enron now faces filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy prote=
ction.=20
""This is totally bad for everyone,"" an East Coast trader said. ""Anyone who =
has positions with Enron is screwed, and little companies that put all of t=
heir production with Enron could go under, too,"" the trader added.=20
Enron confirmed Wednesday in a press release it has temporarily suspended a=
ll payments other than those necessary to maintain core operations.=20
Companies heavily invested in Enron face the possibility of becoming credit=
 risks themselves and being shunned by other marketing and trading entities=
, further reducing liquidity on natural gas and power markets.=20
Energy majors like Aquila Inc. and Mirant had said at the beginning of Enro=
n's troubleds that they were sticking by the corporation to keep the market=
place from floundering. Representatives were not available for comments.=20
Just hours before Enron's lifeline was pulled, the Houston-based company sh=
ut down its electronic trading platform which accounted for a quarter of No=
rth America's natural gas and electricity trades.=20
The blank EnronOnline screen represents a loss of price discovery that is n=
ot covered by alternative trading vehicles such as Atlanta-based Interconti=
nentalExchange, or ICE, an electronic over-the-counter commodity exchange.=
=20
""People are used to trading at a click of the mouse,"" one West Coast trader=
 said. ""EnronOnLine always showed two-way trades, but ICE doesn't always sh=
ow bid/offers because it just doesn't have the volumes.""=20
Power traders in Alberta have a bit of an edge over other regions because o=
f Alberta Watt Exchange, or Watt-Ex, has been supporting liquidity in the m=
arket.=20
Watt-Ex, an independent on-line exchange for trading forward and real-time =
contracts, gained more volumes last month after recruiting Dynegy Canada In=
c. to maintain bids and offers on forward contracts traded on its system.=
=20
And volumes on ICE have picked up substantially since Monday, other traders=
 said, giving credence to a more optimistic picture one analyst painted.=20
""Other companies will rise up and swallow Enron's share of volumes,"" Bill G=
wazd, with Ziff Energy Group, said. ""The world will blink but trading will =
not stop.""=20

The website will provide the user with instantly available transaction policies, procedures, DASH's and other valuable reports and links.  The PortRAC system is an extensive database of merchant and strategic investment information combined with a powerful search engine and report writer.  PortRAC will enable the analysis of our investment portfolio in any fashion that the user specifies such as the calculation of returns for a particular industry or region.

I believe that the new RAC website and PortRAC system will be valuable tools to help manage our business and I would like to provide you a personal ""demo"" before we introduce these applications to a broader population.

In the next two weeks, Rick Carson will be contacting you to arrange a convenient time for the demo, which should take about 30 minutes.  I hope that you will be able to make time in your schedule.

Please call me with any questions.

. His current status is day to day.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Free Agent Up=
dated 11/26/01 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His curren=
t status is day to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Top Dogs Up! da! ted 11/2=
6/01 Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccan=
eers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter=
 of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despit=
e being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineff=
ective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game=
. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  K=
eenan McCardell  , WR JAC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caug=
ht six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the l=
evel of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down=
 the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , =
RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs a=
nd caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good out=
ing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Isma=
il , WR BAL - McKay Neal Upd! at! ed 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to th=
ree catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail=
 remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most co=
mplete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jackson=
ville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic t=
o be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Marti=
n Cuilla Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards aga=
inst Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of =
the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed=
 for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yard=
s. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see=
 him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Free =
Agent Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a=
 good day against Arizona nonetheless! . ! The rookie tailback had 145 scri=
mmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flu=
tie , QB SD - Top Dogs Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing f=
or 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth s=
tarting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Baj=
a Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards=
 and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is o=
nly a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Kl=
ap Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passe=
s for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most rel=
iable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly ba=
sis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a g=
ood outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a to=
uchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is wort=
h starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Eric Bass Updated 11/25/=
01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against=
 New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is w=
orth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Tori Kuykendal=
l Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the b=
all five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yar=
dage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fan=
tasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be =
able to take many carries away from Charli! e ! Garner.   Antowain Smith , =
RB NE - Baja Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two =
touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pret=
ty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Free Age=
nt Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting =
258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantas=
y player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots=
' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 11/25/=
01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the G=
iants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the mo=
st reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Baja Updated =
11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating =
a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return t=
o the game.  Eric Moulds  , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/25/01 Moulds f=
inally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards an=
d two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should s=
till remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. D=
on't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre=
 performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pel=
t had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one intercep=
tion. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he re=
mains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Baja Updated=
 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not =
catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to st=
art for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , Q=
B MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs =
and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a=
 QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable F=
antasy QB.  ! Donovan McNabb  , QB PHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/25/01 The Red=
skins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or =
interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a qu=
iet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Thras=
h caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsisten=
t to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod G=
ardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caugh! t ! four passe=
s for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in t=
he past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch=
.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extens=
ive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carr=
ied 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your=
 Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac=
 Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the i=
njured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muham=

good to read all the smart, witty humor again.  i especially thought the part 
about screaming ""who let the dogs out"" was quite funny.  it makes it 
especially funny b/c the employees play along instead of yelling out ""shut up 
nerd"".   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together.  it was real 
tough to see him go b/c we are pretty close, but not as close as maziarz and 
i evidently are.  but every now and then i still get reminders that i used to 
live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming.  i decided to vacum 
behind the couch b/c i had never cleand back there.  when i looked behind the 
couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails.    at first i was pretty 
freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails possibly get here?  
but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had a nasty habit of 
pulling off his toenails.  i should have figured that he didn't dispose of 
them properly.  it is good to see that chad has figured out how to use the 
email system again.  last week enron sent out a company wide email and our 
boy chad replied back to the whole company.  i felt pretty embarrassed for 
him after he sent the first reply, but went he replied to the whole company a 
second time i just thought that he was an idiot.  now he will be known as the 
guy who replied not once but twice to a company wide email.  well, i sure am 
looking foward to the next state of the union.  i know i will since i am 
going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip clubs.

Anti-Tax Haven Sanctions - What Happens If There Is All Out War?
by Bob Bauman, Editor

We're getting weary of writing about the OECD and FATF blacklists
and those ""sanctions"" that supposedly will be clamped on world tax
havens, come June 30. That was the Paris bureaucrats' self-inflicted
deadline chosen a year back when they believed CLINTON-GORE (remember
them?) leftist Treasury minions would be in control in Washington, DC.

Last June these nervy public relations megaphones for the rich G-7
nations issued arbitrary lists of small nations they accused of being
lax on criminal money laundering and/or engaged in nefarious ""harmful
tax competition.""

Then, and repeatedly since, the Blacklisted Ones have been threatened
with nebulous ""sanctions,"" possibly including severance from world
banking and financial systems. As co-conspirators, the Clinton crowd
at the US Treasury tried and failed to get congressional approval for
this obtuse thuggery. Now a new president named Bush is more or less
in control, and still we wait for what should be an easy & resounding
official ""NO"" to the OECD high tax cartel. Absent the US, there's
little chance the OECD can impose any meaningful ""sanctions,"" however
much the bureaucrat bullies bluster.

But what might sanctions look like? How disruptive could they be,
if they were indeed imposed on the 35 blacklisted offshore nations.

Sovereign Society advisory board member J. Richard DUKE
(http://www.assetlaw.com) calls attention to a 2 part article in the
April and May issues of the Journal of International Taxation,
(available only to subscribers on line). There New York attorney
David E. Spencer provides a glimpse of the chaos that could result
in world financial markets if the OECD has its perverse way by
imposing sanctions on ""uncooperative"" tax haven nations.

Among the OECD suggested sanctions nations might impose;
* use of domestic tax laws to deny all deductions, exemptions,
allowances and credits for taxpayers or entities doing business in
haven nations;
* under civil and criminal penalties, require new, extensive reporting
of all offshore financial activity;
* expansion and strict enforcement of controlled foreign corporation
(CFC) rules;
* levy new withholding taxes on payments or transfers to havens;
* increased tax audits of all offshore business activity;
* review, repeal and/or refusal of bilateral tax treaties;
* special new tariffs on financial activity involving haven nations.

In the case of the US and most other nations, all of these radical
proposals would require legislative action that is highly unlikely to
occur. But imagine what this would do to the international financial
world as we now know it. June 30, here we come!

on the use of offshore bank accounts to evade income taxes.

High Percentage Trading on the S&P
By: James Cordier, Michael Gross, Liberty Trading Group
From: MarketMavens.com, January 8, 2002

With the volatility and higher option premiums, the S&P can be an
ideal market for the properly capitalized trader to write option
premium for increased returns. As we all know, this is the king of
the futures markets, and thus deserves the respect of the option
writer. For this reason, we only participate in the most
conservative of trades when dealing with this contract. Option
sellers (as well as their brokers) like to sleep at night. That being
said, the rewards can still be very attractive.

While we do not pretend to know what the stock market is going
to do, we cannot help but get caught up in the positive outlook
for 2002. Barring another catastrophic terrorist attack, we find it
hard to imagine any reason the stock market would go below the
lows set back in September.

For that reason, we recommend the following simple, high
probability strategy which, if successful, will yield about a 50%
return within 6 months.  Instead of trying to pick individual stocks,
or trying to guess what the S&P will do tomorrow or next week, a
trader takes an ""alternate"" way out.

At the time of this writing, the June S&P is trading at about 1169.
A trader can SELL a June S&P 825 put option and collect about
$1,200 for every option sold. The margin to do this is around
$2,400 per option at this time. For the option to go in the money,
the June S&P would have to fall over 343 points before June.
(That is a full 125 points below the low established in the wake of
September 11th.)

If the market moves higher from here, it should be an easy ride as
the option deteriorates and expires worthless, and the option
seller keeps the money. If the market stays steady, the option
expires worthless, the option seller keeps the money. If the
market falls but stays above 825, the option expires worthless,
the option seller keeps the money. Only if the market is Below
825 at expiration, does the seller have a loss.

However, before you run out and liquidate the retirement
account, lets take a look at the downside possibilities of the
trade. First of all, this trade is only recommended for the
comfortably capitalized account. A drop of 100, 200, or even 300
points in the S&P would still not put your option in the money. But
it may temporarily increase the value of your option and thus also
your margin requirement. A trader should have adequate back up
capital in his account if he intends to ""ride out"" such an
occurrence. The other risk, of course, would be the futures being
below 825 at option expiration, which makes the trader long the
June S&P at 825, not necessarily a bad thing. However, if the
market continues to fall down past 825 and the trader continues
to hold his position, losses could be substantial.

Stock traders considering this strategy should ask themselves the
following question: What type of return do I hope to make on my
stock portfolio by June of this year? Is it close to 50%? What type
of losses would I incur in my stock portfolio if the S&P fell to 825?
In the option trade, you still make 50%. In a move below 825, the
odds are good for a lot of traders that the losses they would incur
in their stock portfolio would be much greater than being short
the S&P at 825. In other words, we think this is a good way to
trade the stock market.

As we said in the beginning, we don't know what the stock
market is going to do. But from a risk standpoint, we like being
long from 825. If you would like to discuss trading this way for
your account, please feel free to give us a call at 800-346-1949
and I will be glad to discuss this strategy with you.

COMMENT: The Money Laundering Farce Must End
by Bob Bauman, Editor.

One of the major arguments of the world money police is the imagined
need to stop ""money laundering."" They claim widespread abuse of banking
and other financial systems by sinister criminal forces. Offering little
proof, artful officials use their questionable premise to justify a
supposed right to monitor and record all financial transactions. By
design, banks and their employees have been forced into the unwanted
role of spies and police deputies.

In the only popular uprising against this arrogant attack on financial
privacy, in 1999 protests from hundreds of thousands of irate Americans
forced the US government to back down on so-called ""Know Your Customer""
rules. The KYC proposals would have made every American banker a
government vetting agent, with a duty to investigate, watch for and
report supposed ""suspicious activity"" of all account holders. (Since
then the Clinton administration has pressed banks to adopt ""voluntary""
KYC rules in spite of these protests).

From earliest history, unless restrained, governments always have used
every available tool to spy on citizens. Until this trumped up money
laundering scare the consensus in western democracies has been that
personal freedom and privacy greatly outweighed prior restrictions
aimed at potential criminal abuse. This established principle rightly
forced police and prosecutors to build each individual case on legally
gathered evidence rather than use the dragnet approach.

But now prosecutors reverse this traditional right to privacy. Instead
of a presumption of innocence, whole classes of people are viewed as
potential criminals based solely on wealth and its free use. Subject to
civil forfeiture, the accused are stripped of their assets and forced
to prove their innocence.

Are these drastic restrictions on financial freedom justified?

Existing anti-ML efforts have proven very costly and highly ineffective.
In the US in 1998, only 932 people were convicted of money laundering,
yet the cost to the private and public sectors exceeded $10 billion,
averaging more than $10 million per conviction. Based on several years
statistics, a British law professor calculated that the UK government
has stopped only 0.004% of the criminal money that flowed through the
City of London. The professor concluded: ""Money launderers do not have
a statistically significant chance of being caught, hence the deterrent
effect of such laws is negligible.""

The question must be asked: ""When is this madness to stop?"" No one
should ever have to justify he right to keep their personal business
private, except upon an individual indictment based on specific facts
presented to a court of law.

This financial dragnet must end. A continuing and expanded popular
resistance holds the key to success.

1304,"Greetings All!

As most of you know, there is a Trader Web-site project initiative currently 
in progress to identify specific reports that traders have produced every day 
and to then automatically publish these reports to a web-site. 

We are in the initial stage of collecting requirements from the traders 
(identified by Steve Stock) to determine what reports and report information 
are to be submitted for publishing on a web-site.  Based on these 
discussions, the requirements listed below have been identified so far.  
Please review these requirements and let me know if you have any changes or 
additional requirements by EOB Tuesday, March 6.  Also, please forward all 
report templates, required report information, and security requirements for 
your region.  If you are not be able to provide this information by next 
Tuesday, please let me know. 

Trader Report Web-site Requirements:

1. Need a separate web-site developed and implemented (in the same manner 
that the Executive Report Viewer project, which is   being handled by Zhiyong 
Wei's team)
2. Web-site to be available 24 hours a day X 7 days a week
3. There are 5 Risk Regions: East, West, Central, Texas, and Financial
4. Each person leads a region as follows:
 Kam Keiser   / East Risk Region
 Darron Giron   / West Risk Region
 Phillip Love  / Central Risk Region
 David Baumbach  / Texas Risk Region
 Errol McLaughlin / Financial Risk Region
5. Jeff Gossett is the Project Lead for Traders
6. There are several traders within each region
7. Security -  All traders should have access within their own region.  
Security will need to be set up to only view each trader's  respective region 
(or any additional regions identified).  Security requirements need to be 
defined and documented by  each region lead, listing the name of each person 
that will be able to view what particular region/s reports.
8. All reports are currently in Excel and need a macro to export to the new 
web-site (formulas are within the spreadsheets).   Required reports are to be 
identified by each region lead, with sample report templates. 
9. A total of 15 reports are needed now and need more room for additional 
reports to be added in the future
10. Reports are to be automatically exported daily (reports are run each 
night) and to be published with ""view only"" capabilities on  the web-site
11. History - Need to maintain 30 days of history, and also every last day of 
each month beginning (starting from) 1/01/01 and  forward 

I will be meeting with Zhiyong next week to discuss these requirements, and I 
will schedule project meetings as needed going forward.    
Please contact me if you have any questions or need additional information.  
Thank you for your input and support!!

1340,"One of the World Hunger issues is that GE does  not want Enron to be able to 
issue a unilateral change order which would impact the manufacturing schedule.

We have the same issue in the Arcos Power Island deal.  

Following is what I intend to propose to solve the Arcos problem and might 
work  for World Hunger:


"" Purchaser acknowledges taht Seller's ability to accomodate changes in 
manufacturing scope in a timely or cost effective manner diminish as Seller 
gets further along into the manufacturing process, and after a point changes 
can only be made after assembly completion or in the field without adversely 
affecting Seller's manufacturing obligations to other clients (a ""Client 
Impact"").  Where such a Client Impact circumstance exists, Seller shall 
identify such constraints to Purchaser in its proposal submitted pursuant to 
Clause 17.2.(b) [time and cost estimate to accomodate the Change 
Order-Variation Order], which Purchaser shall take into account in evaluating 
Seller's proposed cost and time changes arising out of such Variation scope 
change. ""

Hunger document-  I do  not want to propose for Arcos if it gives you great 
difficultly for World Hunger.

The Insurance Law Section would like to personally invite you to attend the

Thursday, June 14, 2001 at the State Bar convention in Austin.

On June 14, 2001, the Insurance Law Section will hold its annual meeting and 
sponsor its annual 3 hour CLE program at the Four Season's Hotel. As usual, 
Council members and Committee chairs will be elected  by the Section members  
at the annual meeting. The schedule for the meeting and the CLE program is 
set out below. We hope that you can attend the annual meeting and the CLE 
presentations.

1:30 PM to 2:00 PM - - annual section meeting and election of Council members

2:00 PM to 5:00 PM  FREE   CLE program


2 p.m. - 3 p.m.
Insurance Declaratory Judgment Actions
Topic: This panel will consider declaratory judgment actions regarding 
insurance coverage. When should they be filed? Who should file them? What 
discovery is necessary and appropriate? Can they usually be resolved by 
summary judgment? How should these cases be tried? What is the proper role of 
the expert? What is the proper role of the jury? What are the appellate 
twists?

Comment: The Supreme Court of Texas has repeatedly suggested that insurers 
and insureds alike put this procedural device to more use.

Panelists:
Mike Huddleston
Karen Keltz
Rusty McMains
Claudia Volaire
Beth Bradley
Stephen Walraven

3 p.m.- 4 p.m.

When Negligence Blindly Assists Deliberateness

Topic: Suppose Mr. Sleeze Ball sets out to kill his business partner, Cheese 
Square. Suppose further that Mrs. Ball helps Sleeze in various ways which 
turn out to be necessary. Suppose further that Mrs. Ball does not realize 
what Sleeze is up to and does not foresee the consequences of her actions. 
Finally, suppose Sleeze is convicted of murder and then a wrongful death 
action is brought by Cheesey's family (Swiss, Cheddar, and the rest) against 
both Mr. and Mrs. Ball, and their dog Astral. Naturally the Balls have 
homeowner's coverage and Mrs. Ball wants a defense. Question: Should she get 
it?

Comment: This is a burning issue in contemporary liability insurance law, and 
a great deal turns on it. Plaintiff's personal injuries lawyers take note.

Debaters:
Michael Sean Quinn - Affirmative
Christopher Martin - Negative

4 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.

Insurance Defense Guidelines

Topic: Many liability insurers have attempted to issue guidelines and rules 
to govern the ways in which defense lawyers may conduct defenses. Often, if 
the activities of defense counsel do not conform to these guidelines defense 
counsel do not get paid. Recently the Texas legislature outlawed these 
guidelines, or at least some of them. Is this law a good idea, or a bad one? 
Will it be effective? Will it be enforced? Is it really in the interest of 
insureds who are defendants in law suits or is it designed to help lawyers?

Panelists:
Charles Levy
Roland Leon
Clark Richards

Format: Audience participation on all of these topics is welcomed.
It is positively encouraged, not that it could be stopped anyway.

We hope to see you there next week.

1354,"I have made changes for ""97-10"" compliance to the last draft I have of

under the contract, but has minimal obligations thereunder.   The 
Construction Manager has most of the obligations, but cannot provide the 
indemnification EECC is used to seeing from their counterparty.  

Lisa - there may be spots where you do or do not want the Owner mentioned - I 
tried to limit it to when the Owner was a beneficiary, but that may strain 
some of the legal relationships - we may need to change a few of the 
references.   Accounting may have some objections to the way some things are

Do you want hand-written or e-mail comments going forward?

Do you want more comments from Origination and Services now, or do you want us to wait until you turn the doc?  As I said yesterday, I am in the process of sorting out the ""Costs"" definition so that it works better with the other parts of the doc.  

MDEA is willing to extend the ILA two weeks if we want to.  Their next Board meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that meeting.  We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until their Board votes on the full agreement.  The other option is to get done this week and have them call a special Board meeting.

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

In addition to my comments regarding the definitions, here are some other 
thoughts:

Letter agreement:

haven't checked on availability.  

2. Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days.  2 
(a)  Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine 
Contract.  Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology.

3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement. 

5 (d)  change 1st ""shall"" to ""'may"".

7 (b) does this make sense?  Should we also have the right to specific 
performance?

9.  (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing 
of the letter agreement.  Should say by closing such will have been 
obtained.  I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep

	(Corrected 1:59 pm)
	
	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In response to new California power market rules 
proposed Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Enron 
Corp (ENE, news, msgs) has canceled some new generator projects it was 
discussing with the state's electric grid operator, Enron said. 
	The generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to 
300 megawatts of new generation installed in California next spring, Enron 
said. The company, however, continues to negotiate other new generator 
projects with the California Independent System Operator. 
	The FERC Wednesday proposed limiting the California Power Exchange's price 
setting mechanism to $150 a megawatt-hour. The preliminary order could become 
a federal mandate by the end of the year, after the FERC takes comments from 
the public, or it could be modified. 
	Enron and 13 other companies, meanwhile, are in final negotiations with the 
ISO for the new peaking capacity for next summer. The ISO plans to pay a 
total of $255 million a year for three years to the power companies for 
installing the new generators, which the power companies will own. 
	In addition, California's three investor-owned utilities would pay the 
generators for any electricity the new generators produce. Pricing for the 
power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state-chartered 
CalPX. 
	""There's too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost 
associated with those specific projects. For the purposes of making capital 
commitments, we view this as a $150 price cap,"" Enron's Mark Palmer said. 
	Earlier Wednesday, the ISO's chief operating officer, Terry Winter, expressed 
concern that FERC's proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects. 
	FERC's proposals Wednesday are the result of a two-month investigation of 
California's wholesale electricity market, where prices this summer were 
three times what they were a year earlier. To meet the state's rising demand 
for power, California's three utilities have paid billions of dollars more 
than anticipated to independent power producers in order to keep the lights 
on.

       =DJ Asia Debt:Pricing In Tokyo Credit Derivs Mkt A Bit Askew

Dow Jones International News Service via Dow Jones



  By Brian Fowler


  A Dow Jones Newswires Column


  TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Pricing levels in Tokyo's credit derivatives market
show  it's cheaper to buy protection on some top-rated Japanese issuers
these days  than on U.S. names with similar ratings, a clear sign that
record-high  bankruptcies and bad debts in the banking system aren't
shaking the market's  faith in this nation's top companies.

  Take, for example, Ford Motor Co. (F) and Honda Motor Co. (HMC or 7267).
Both  have solid A2 credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service. And yet,
as of last  week, the cost of credit default protection on five-year Honda
U.S.  dollar-denominated debt stood around 30 basis points, while
protection on  five-year debt issued by Ford Motor Credit, Ford's financing
arm, was around 70  basis points.

  Bankers and institutional investors use the credit derivatives market
either  to shed risk on loans and bonds or to take on risk as an
investment. In a credit  default swap, the most commonly-used credit
derivative, one party pays a fee  measured in basis points on a notional
value. The recipient of the fee - the  risk-taker - is considered the
investor.

  In the case of Honda Motor, Japanese banks looking to reduce the exposure
in  their portfolios to that company's debt would benefit from the
relatively low  cost of doing so. But hedge funds, non-life insurers and
other investors seeking  exposure to Honda as a way of picking up revenue
would get stuck with lower  returns.

  ""One of Honda's main markets is the U.S. market, so if an investor wants
exposure to the U.S. auto market, Ford offers better spreads,"" said Joseph
Slankas, assistant vice president in the Global Credit Derivatives division
at  Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.

  The pricing distortions in Tokyo's credit derivatives market can be
linked to  two main factors: the low interest rate environment here and
skewed  supply-demand dynamics.

  ""In the last two years, markets have swung from a focus on hedging to
being  totally dominated by investors,"" said Malcolm Perry, managing
director at J.P.  Morgan Securities Asia Pet. Limited in Tokyo.

  Not surprisingly, heavy demand to sell protection reduces the premium on
that  service.

  More than anything else, however, the narrow spreads in Japan's credit
derivatives market underscore the relatively underdeveloped state of the
nation's corporate bond market and the effect this has on liquidity.
  For decades, Japanese companies have tended to rely heavily on bank
financing  rather than directly tapping capital markets. As a result, while
Japan's  government bond market is as big or bigger than the Treasurys
market, the  corporate bond market here remains relatively small.

  The value of outstanding Japanese corporate bonds was around Y50 trillion
at  the end of February, according to the Japan Securities Dealers
Association.  That's less than one-eighth the size of the U.S. market,
where the value of  outstanding issues stood at $3.372 trillion at the end
of December, according to  the U.S. Bond Market Association.

  A small market means a dearth of liquidity, which inhibits trading in
secondary markets.

  On top of that, the lack of an indigenous Japanese high-yield market -
all of  Japan's high-yield issuers are so-called fallen angels - leaves
investors with  few opportunities to diversify their portfolios. As a
result, the bulk of  trading in Tokyo's credit derivatives market involves
names rated A or higher.
  To be sure, there are also historical factors that tilt the supply-demand
balance. Despite the bad-loan crisis here, many Japanese bankers feel that
domestic top-rated companies are still a relatively safe bet in the
international marketplace.

  ""Even if ratings are the same, we tend to feel that the real distance a
corporation has to fall to default is larger here,"" said Takashi Miyauchi,
manager of the Derivative Products Division at Fuji Bank Ltd.
  It's not hard to see why. The U.S. corporate landscape has been scorched
recently by the likes of companies such as Xerox Corp. (XRX) and Lucent
Technologies (LU), both of which have struggled over the past year with
heavy  debt loads and credit rating downgrades after having been considered
solid  credits going into the year 2000.

  Moody's cut its domestic currency rating for Xerox to Baa2 in September
2000,  three notches below where the rating had been at the end of 1999.
Lucent's fall  was even steeper - to Baa3 in February, four notches below
where it was in  October 2000.

  In contrast, credit derivatives players in Tokyo say they can't recall a
major  credit event on a traded Japanese name since late 1998, when
Long-Term Credit  Bank and Nippon Credit Bank collapsed in quick
succession.
  The sense of relative safety regarding top-rated Japanese names is a key
factor in the dearth of tiering - or spread - between different grades of
double  A credits, according to Kazuyasu Makabe, vice president, credit
trading at J.P.  Morgan Securities Asia.

  ""Toyota Corp., with tremendous fundamentals, is rated AA1 and trades with
a  credit default swap rate around 15 basis points in yen. Sony, another
great  company, is two notches lower at AA3 and yet only trades about two
basis points  over Toyota,"" Makabe said.

  In the U.S. you might expect the lower-rated credit to trade at a spread
of 10  basis points or more over the higher-rated company, Makabe said.
  The upshot of this is that low spreads can squeeze some investors out of
the  market for Japanese names.

  ""We are focusing on U.S. and euro names because spreads on Japanese names
are  so tight,"" said Koji Ogawa, assistant manager of the Investment and
Structured  Finance Group at the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance  Co.
  Pricing is an increasing concern for casualty insurers like Tokio Marine
and  Fire because the effects of deregulation have hit profitability in
core  operations while sluggish stock prices and rock-bottom interest rates
have  weighed on investment returns.

  ""The core businesses for non-life companies are becoming less profitable,
so  it's important for them to diversify earnings sources,"" said Ayako
Nakajima,  non-life insurer analyst at Standard & Poor's in Tokyo.

I met with Greg yesterday to follow up on the meeting we had last week with 
you (Jeff).  Greg asked to see an estimate of how much money we think this 
endeavor will really cost (a copy was delivered to your office today).

We modeled two scenarios, both assume we buy WebModal.  We Modeled a base 
case of trading volume, and then cut that in half.  Details are in the 
presentation.

The basic conclusion is that this will be a much more expensive endeavor to 
start than our traditional markets (coal, paper, weather, etc.), but 
substantially less than EBS or EES.  Year one costs including capital, IT, 
and people is expected to be approximately $43mm.  That is slightly offset by 
$10mm in revenue.   All of these numbers assume that we are fully staffed for 
the whole year, which is unrealistic, so for 2001, the staffing costs are 
slightly exaggerated.

Anyway, the conclusion was that Greg was going to recommend to Frevert that 
we pursue the business and WebModal.  He expected to talk to him next week.  
Until then, we will try to finalize a Dash.

I will be out next week, but reachable.

Thanks for your help,

1431,"In reviewing the contracts, so far I have the following questions:

1.     Have Oman LNG and ADgas taken the risk of non-performance by DPC and 
indirectly MSEB without any credit support?  The only security is the equity 
in DPC?  Are such contracts typically secured or done with a buyer with deep 
pockets?  How much value was put into DPC by the shareholders?

2.     Are there local public policy issues that could be addressed by local 
courts with respect to the LNG contracts?  Fraud?  Bribery?  Are there any 
local law issues with respect to performance or interpretation of the 
contracts?  Isn't take-or-pay meaningless without credit support?

3.     What are the arguments for DPC to terminate the contracts?  Only where 
the PPA is terminated?  Payments?

4.    Who negotiated the contracts?  Were there requests for credit support?  
From Enron?  Did Enron ever promise to indirectly ""backstop"" the contracts by 
its investment in Dabhol?

5.   What was the discussion regarding the ""reduction in operational 
capability"" language in the contracts?  What was the language meant to 
cover?  Do we need our counterparty's approval to investigate other markets?

6.    Is there any argument that DPC has already breached the contracts?  
Could our counterparties issue a press release claiming damages over the 
entire term of the contract? Confidentiality and press releases?

7.    What is the law on piercing the corporate veil for an Indian company 
like DPC?  Could this issue be considered separate from the contract and be 
litigated in India or Oman and thus outside the arbitration?

8.     What is the list of all documents that could impact on whether or not 
Enron has any exposure under the LNG contracts?

9.     Are there instances where the Dabhol project could fail and the LNG 
contracts would not novate to MSEB?  Why does it matter if the LNG contract 
obligations novate to MSEB if DPC has no money?

10.   Other potential claims against Enron if the LNG contracts are 
terminated or not performed?

1432,"John,

This is a follow-up to our earlier discussion.  I would like to have you lay 
out our physical crude needs to become a player a long with some action steps 
to accomplish the goal.  I don't want to forget about this because I believe 
it may be something we need to assign someone or a mid-market or originator 
or team to accomplish.  I would like to see foreign and domestic.  
I see this as one of our possible competitive advantages or at least to solve 
the problem of not being in the know and getting second hand info or 
pricing.

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, we'd like to 
outline the following organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions, and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets, 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  
Still under consideration - The Enron Corporate Insurance group under Jim 
Bouillion will now report into the corporate organization under  George 
Wasaff.

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President and Chief 
Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to 
Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Enron 
Corp.  He will be responsible to Sally Beck for the business operations areas 
of the businesses.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila 
Glover, business controller for Financial Products;  Todd Hall, business 
controller for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global 
liquids and coal.  In addition, Tom Myers as Director of Accounting.  Brent 
and his team are responsible for all accounting and position reporting issues 
for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

Premiums Stay High on Enron's Near Options, And `Doubling Up' Date Looms fo=

NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron's near-month options remain ex=
tremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=
or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=
mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled=
 investors.=20
Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=
n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =
more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=
d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=
e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=
e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on=
 Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=
egy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=
ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20
For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the ""wash =
sale"" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =
selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring ""substantially i=
dentical"" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This=
 poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=
ces now make them attractive ""buy"" candidates.=20
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=
ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=
t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=
ed by the investor.=20
So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by ""doubling up"": buyi=
ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =
the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=
hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=
tional stock.

Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
ibillion-dollar deal.=20
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=
ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=
any, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=
he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=
wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=
ction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=
erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=
ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=
ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=
han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =
shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =
In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =
volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=
y lower, market observers said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=
ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=
gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=
ve Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory =
approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=
 announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enr=
on.=20
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=
 away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=
nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=
called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=
is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=
omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=
., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=
 drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=
 two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=
ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=
on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =
planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=
nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=
ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=
 the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =
However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =
Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =
of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=
 price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=
nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=
ding relatively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=
ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=
 would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=
blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=
 Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario""=
 is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20
Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According=
 to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=
change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=
ron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =
above $80 a share.=20
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=
ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=
. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=
t the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could ""recover =
the significant business that has been lost"" in its giant energy-trading op=
erations. ""The Enron machine continues to sputter,"" Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=
egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=
aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=
nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing ""is highly possible,""=
 said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=
. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=
ch above noninvestment-grade, or ""junk,"" status. But Fitch also said it bel=
ieved Enron's trading partners had made ""significant cash collateral calls""=
 in recent days that are ""well in excess of previous expectations,"" contrib=
uting to ""liquidity pressures.""=20
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=
m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=
workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=
eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=
e doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=
erger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=
ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=

1482,"I have decided to revive the risk brown bag training sessions.

I need, from each of you, a list of the topics you would like to see covered.  I would like to see topics ranging from the most basic, up - whatever you feel is necessary for your group.  Please provide these to me no later than 04/18.  Feel free to offer anything.  Think about the concepts in the training modules while you are compiling your lists.

Once I have the topics, I will work with you to arrange a logical order to cover them in.  After that  Irena and I will set up a calendar, with approximately one session per month.  I am targeting mid-May for the first session.

The format of each session is up to the presenter, but a couple of suggestions are: a short presentation followed by Q&A, or an open forum.  Each session will be led by one of you, a suitable substitute, Jeff, or I, depending on the topic.  I will schedule, with your input and cooperation, who will present each topic.

I am also sending this note to John and Russ.  

John, I ask that you think about OA concepts that you feel will benefit the risk group, help our personnel work better with your group, and help us understand your duties better.  I would like for you to present at least a couple of topics to us.

Russ, if you think there are Sitara issues that would benefit the group, please let me know.

I am open to whether these sessions are mandatory or not.  My feeling is that some should be and others (the ones of a more basic nature) should only be mandatory for those people you feel need that month's subject matter.  Let me know your opinion on this.

With a small investment of your time, I believe this will be an excellent vehicle to get (and keep) topics of interest and training in front of your people.

I look forward to receiving your lists.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Western Spot Power Prices Sink Amid River Runoff, Mild Weather

     Portland, Oregon, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Western U.S.
peak spot power prices for delivery tomorrow plummeted as
hydroelectric operators were forced to generate power, traders
said.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
declined 38.4 percent from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of
$140.55 a megawatt hour, with executed trades between $135.00-
$150.00.
     ""Run-off is increasing hydroelectric supplies,"" said one
Northwest trader.
     Traders said that smaller dams in the Portland area don't
have the capability to store excess water from mountain snowmelt,
so they have to generate power or spill water.
     ""The weather is mild in the Northwest, causing snow melt to
run off into the reservoirs,"" said one Northwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington,
Massachusetts, temperatures in Portland, Oregon were expected to
reach 63 degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing tomorrow 2 degrees
to 65 degrees.

     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power slipped
$72.20, to a Bloomberg index of $150.92 as traders executed
transactions in the $140.50-$150.00 range. Traders said they sold
off-peak power as low as $21.00 and as high as $40.00.
     Traders said that Arizona Public Service Co.'s 1,270-
megawatt Palo Verde 1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona,
increased production 20 percent from yesterday to 70 percent of
capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage
that began March 31.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power slumped $73.33 to a Bloomberg index of $139.67 amid trades

Northeast Spot Power Prices Steady Amid Idle Market Conditions

     Philadelphia, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Spot power prices
in the Northeast U.S. were little changed this morning, amid
expectations for continued increases in available generation and
stagnant cooling loads, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demands 89 and 97 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Thursday delivery was assessed 65 cents
higher, at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $33.80 per
megawatt hour.
     Traders said tomorrow's projected load requirements and
generation outages were virtually unchanged, leaving little room
for movement in the day-ahead market.
     The Interconnection projected loads for the first six on-peak
hours of tomorrow to average just 100 megawatts greater than
today, and increases in available generation were estimated at
only 23 megawatts.
     The next-week market was volatile however, as revised weather
forecasts, calling for cooler temperatures, left many marketers
scrambling to readjust positions.
     ""The weather forecast for next-week has been drastically
revised,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""Anyone holding excess power
for that period was looking to unload it this morning, and the
market just fell out of bed from there.""
     Traders said early morning trades topped out at $48.00,
before trailing off to lows in the $40.00-$41.00 range.
     In the New England Power Pool, day-ahead power sold 25 cents
lower amid trades in the $51.50-$52.50 range, with most deals
executed at $52.00.
     Entergy Corp. said it began the process of restarting its
670-megawatt Pilgrim 1 nuclear reactor at 3:07 a.m., although
traders agreed the additional megawatts didn't affect tomorrow's
market.
     ""It's not a very big unit, so a minimal increase in
production isn't going to make a noticeable difference,"" said one
Northeast trader. ""I'm sure it will be reflected in tomorrow's
day-ahead market, when output will be closer to capacity.""
     Next-week packages traded heavily in New England, as they did
in PJM, though prices for the 5-day block there remained firm at
$55.00. Traders said heavy purchases from one of the region's load
serving entities might have helped support the market, by
offsetting forecasts for cooler temperatures.
     Temperatures in Boston, one of New England's primary load
centers, are forecast to average less than 60 degrees through the
early part of next week.

Southeast Demand Again Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Continued high
weather-related demand from the Southeast and a combination of
unit outages and transmission problems in the Midwest drove Mid-
Continent peak power prices up again today, traders said.
     East Central Area Reliability Council prices rose for the
fourth consecutive day as heavy weather-related demand from the
Tennessee Valley Authority grid continued, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for day-ahead power delivered into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $6.11
to $46.25 a megawatt-hour and has gained almost $19.00 this week.
Trades ranged from $44.50 up to $50.00 after options expiration.
     Cinergy traders said the late price rise came as marketers
oversold to TVA and had to buy power back from there to cover
short positions.
     In contrast to the daily market, short-term over-the-counter
prices dropped, with power for Friday delivery offered $2.00 less
than yesterday's price for Thursday-Friday parcels at $41.00 and
power for delivery from May 21-25 offered $7.00 less at $40.50.
     ""There's a new weather forecast out, and it's going to be a
lot cooler next week now than we originally thought,"" one trader
said. ""I wish I'd sold myself way short on the next week package
yesterday, but what can you do?""
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power at
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub sold $2.46 higher on
average at $40.00-$46.00 and power in the lower half of the
region $2.79 higher on average at $46.00-$52.00.
     MAIN traders said transmission constraints all but
eliminated the ability to sell power west into the Mid-Continent
Area Power Pool, causing market focus to shift to the South and
East.
     With several unit outages and transmission problems,
continued hot weather and imports from MAIN unavailable, day-
ahead power prices in MAPP were the highest in the region again
today, traders said.
     Next-day power sold $1.00 higher on average in northern MAPP
at $50.00-$55.00 and 33 cents higher in the southern half of the
region at $50.00-$55.00. Traders said activity was limited, as
most utilities had no excess power available.
     ""It's still in the 80s (degrees) here, which is much hotter
than we're used to this early in the year,"" one trader said. ""Add
to that these unit outages, and you get what we have right now; a
pretty big mess.""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Recent Heat Moderates

     Atlanta, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as several major regional
population centers expected cooler weather tomorrow, while
others expected weather to remain hot, utility traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose an average of 39 cents a megawatt-
hour from equivalent trades made yesterday for delivery today,
to $47.77, amid trades in the $36.50-$60.00 range.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 87 degrees Fahrenheit,
unchanged from today's projected high.
     In sections of the Southwest Power Pool, tomorrow's
projected highs for Topeka, Kansas, were expected to decline to
the high-70s to low-80s tomorrow, utility traders said.
     ""There was not a lot of trading done in the next-day
markets because we expect to see a break in the weather,"" said
one SPP-based utility trader. ""Our temperatures, which are
expected to hit the 92-94 degree mark today, will decline to
about 10 degrees below normal tomorrow.""
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., cooling demand across the Southeast was expected to
average about normal over the next week.
     Over the next 6-10 days, temperatures in the Southeast are
expected to average 3.1 degrees below normal, the forecaster
said.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power for tomorrow
traded in a ""broad"" range of $40.00-$53.00, though the majority
of energy trades were reported at a Bloomberg index of $44.57,
24 cents more than yesterday.
     Expectations for continued warm weather on the U.S. Gulf
Coast and troubling transmission line loading relief measures
between sections of southern Mid-Continent Area Power Pool and
the northern SPP, kept Entergy Corp. prices from falling,
traders said.
     The Bloomberg day-ahead peak Entergy index fell 2 cents
from yesterday to $49.73 amid trades in the $45.00-$55.00
range.
     Traders said prices could dip tomorrow in the Gulf Coast
region because natural gas futures for June delivery on the New
York Mercantile Exchange were slipping. June futures declined
28.3 cents per million British thermal units to $4.38 per
million Btu.

U.K. Winter Power Contracts Little Changed in Heavy Trade

     London, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Winter 2001 power prices
in the U.K. closed little changed today, although the contract was
unusually active, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload was last assessed 10 pence lower at
21.30-21.40 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Although Winter 2001 traded over 60 times, one trader said
the contract traded ""range-bound'' throughout the day, as
participants purchased and sold the contract in an effort to
create liquidity in the market.
     ""Its unprecedented for over 800 megawatts to have traded and
we've seen little change. It's evident a player out there is very
keen to get liquidity going in the market,'' another trader said.
     Traders said the two major trading houses that have been
trading the contract aggressively over the past week were the main
market participants again today.
     Day-ahead prices tumbled today even though reports of outage
problems persisted, traders said.
     British Energy's Sizewell B nuclear plant was reported to
have shut for maintenance last Friday because of an acid leak,
although this couldn't be confirmed.
     ""The spot market continued to be volatile. We are still
seeing a lot of panic buying and selling,'' one trader said. ""It
seems people must have overbought in preparation for these planned
outages and now need to sell.''
     Day-ahead baseload started trade at 23.50 pounds a megawatt-
hour, before plummeting to trade at 18.00 pounds a megawatt-hour,
5.00 pounds lower than yesterday.

Nordic Electricity Prices Close Higher on Elevated Spot Value

     Lysaker, Norway, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, rose in
active afternoon trade after generators set tomorrow's spot price
above expectations, traders said.
Participants rushed to close positions ahead of a Norwegian
holiday tomorrow that will keep the market closed. Nordpool is
scheduled to re-open on Friday.
     Winter-2, 2001 jumped 1.75 kroner a megawatt-hour to close at
a record high of 218.25 kroner a megawatt-hour with 449.00
megawatts exchanged. Winter-1, 2002 gained 2.10 kroner after
166.00 megawatts traded between 216.00-218.75 kroner a megawatt-
hour.
     Although industrial end-user demand was anticipated to drop
tomorrow as Norway celebrates Constitution Day, Thursday's system
area average price was set at 195.41 kroner a megawatt-hour, more
than 10 kroner above traders' expectations of 185.00 kroner a
megawatt-hour and down 2.97 kroner from today's price.
     Producers in western Norway retained control over inflowing
molten snow, pushing prices higher, an Oslo-based trader said. The
minimum hourly spot price in Trondheim, Norway was set at 190.88
kroner a megawatt-hour, only 4.53 kroner lower than the system
area average price.
     Nordpool reported an expected 2.5 percent increase in
Norwegian reservoirs to 34.7 percent of total capacity at the end
of week 19 from the previous week, compared to 49.9 percent of
total capacity a year ago. In Sweden, reservoirs were up 7.9
percent to 33.2 percent of total capacity, beating expectations of
a 5.2 percent gain.
     Snowmelt in Norway was likely to peak in the next ten days,
delaying water tank refilling, while in Sweden it peaked last
week, traders said.
     Limited snow accumulation in the important hydro-producing
region of western Norway has also minimized the effect of
anticipated supply increases.
     In the shorter-term, week 21 closed 1.50 kroner higher at
195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 286.00 megawatts
traded as low as 190.75 kroner a megawatt-hour. Week 22 jumped
5.00 kroner a megawatt-hour to 204.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Total volumes more-than-quadrupled in afternoon trade to
3,717 gigawatt-hours generation compared to this morning's 738
gigawatt-hours.

As discussed, here's the particulars on the Bee County  Ranch:
 
795+ ac, lots of oak trees, one of the higher hills in Bee  County.  Good mix of pasture and sage brush.  There's a water well and  tank.  
 
A real ""honey hole"".  Lots of quail and prime dove  hunting. Deer, hogs and supposedly some turkey.
 
Owner's name is Colton Brinkoeter.  Asking $675/acre, no  minerals.  Negotiable.  I think for that price you ought to get 1/4 -  1/2 of the minerals.
 
Ranch is three miles west of Mineral (NNW of Beeville about 15  miles).  His number is 361-358-2582.  I found out about it from a  mutual friend of ours, Bryan Key, also from Beeville.

Joe Parks just completed the sale of the gas in storage at the Centana Facility.  Below you will see confirmation of our receipt of the sales price.  Joe will send to me (and I can forward to any interested party) the methodology for the sales price calculation.  Of this amount, approximately $225,000 will be escrowed (these are for pre-petition obligations under the storage agreement with Centana) subject to some future resolution.  My understanding is that Ed McMichael and his team will be evaluating what to do with the Centana Storage Agreement (accept or reject).

I signed up for the MS150 bicycle ride from Houston to Austin on April 20-21.  One requirement is a donation of $300 to the National MS Society.  I hope to raise this minimum amount through contributions from colleagues, friends, and family; thus the purpose of this email.  With your help, you can help me raise funds to help find a cure for MS.  No donation is too small and I will provide you a receipt if necessary.

I've been training for two (2) months and it's been fun.  I've been biking off and on for a few years now but this is my first big two-day race.  And I look forward to the actual ride.

=================================================================================

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms may be mild such as numbness in the limbs or severe -- paralysis or loss of vision. 
Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are giving hope to those affected by the disease. 
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is dedicated to ending the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.

I'll be glad to share with you my progress and any (exaggerated) road bike stories.  Thanks.

The order requires that we retain all documents (in paper or electronic form) in existence on February 15.  Documents created after February 15 must be retained if, as the order states, the document contains information relevant to:  (1) any claim or defense that may be asserted in the bankruptcy by Enron or a party-in-interest; (2) the financial condition or otherwise in connection with the reorganization of Enron under the Bankruptcy Code; or (3) any governmental investigation or litigation now underway or commenced prior to the termination of this order concerning (a) Enron or any Enron-related affiliates or individuals, (b) present or former directors or officers of Enron, or (c) any affilitiates, subsidiaries, partnerships or joint ventures or other entities which, to Enron's knowledge, Enron or any Enron-related entity participated.

Please regard the terms of the Order as applying to all Enron companies, not just companies that are a part of the bankruptcy proceeding.  If you are uncertain whether you should retain any particular document, please call Bob Williams at extension 5-2402.  You should err on the side of retaining the document.

My sense is that should they desire to hold in escrow additional amounts (without the estate agreement)  they are exercising set off rights w/ affiliated ownership under an implied storage lease agreement.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas.

These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.

Enron North America-Upstream Products
Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu.  
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power
Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

IN THE NEWS

""To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World.  At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies.

mailing it back with a note saying forget it.
Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying ""thanks"".

Go figure.

We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the last
three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next
year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still
waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet does
not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He and
I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a
corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002 to
April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey

1603,"Deer All:

I have a person that might fit what we are looking for in the 8th spot or to 
fill a gap left by Joe (who is currently unable to provide a firm response).

B.J. Johnson. Played football with Chad and I at Jesuit. Was a year a head 
of us. Met Zander at UH in College and hung with he and Brian while they 
were rooming together. Went to lawschool a few years after me. Is out and 
doing well with at a well known plaintiff's lawfirm.
Nice guy. He mentioned a year or so ago to call him if we ever had a spot. 
His dad used to take him hunting and BJ wants to return the favor. Looking 
for a place he could take his dad once or twice a year, just to get out 
there not to shoot deer. He has two small girls, is busier than I am and 
would go no more than the rest of the Houston boys.

He is a good guy. Don't know much about his deer hunting experience, but I 
don't care about that.

Chad and Brian give him the stamp of approval. My thought is we could 
proceed as set with Chris and I splitting the 8th spot, but if Joe winds up 
taking a job out of state (which is a possibility) we would be left with two 
spots to fill and less time to do it. I think it might be best to offer this 
spot to BJ and fill up all 8 spots, then if we lose Joe, Chris and I can be 
the fall back plan.

Thoughts and comments from the McComb guys please.


Erik.

1674,"Dear Parents of Mrs. Blair's Second Graders, 

It is hard to believe that the school year is almost over. ?I hope it has  
been a good year for your child. ?I am emailing everyone about two matters. ? 

The first is the End of Year Party. ?It is on May 25th from 10:00 until  
11:30. ?The format is a baseball game among the classes - the second graders  
will be divided into four teams. ?After the game, we will serve hot dogs and  
drinks. We have five volunteers to ""help"" but no one has volunteered to 
chair  
it. ?The volunteers are Norm Nabhan, Allison Grove, Karen George, Margaret 
or  
Mike Pierce, Lila Mazzone and Nancy Rybarezyk as sub. ?Does anyone out there  
want to chair this party?  

The second matter is our class gift to Mrs. Blair. ?We will get the three  
second grade teachers gift certificates using the money we collected from 
the  
parents at our class meetings. ?I also think that it would be nice for each  
child in Mrs. Blair's class to write her a letter thanking her for her  
efforts as teacher, telling her what they liked about the class, special  
memories, or anything they want to say. ?I propose that these letters be  
written on 8 X 11 paper and that each one have the child's school picture  
affixed to it. ?If everyone would bring these on the last day of school, we  
can put them in a notebook and present them to Mrs. Blair. ?My idea for the  
notebook is a thin three ring binder with a clear pocket on the front into  
which we can insert a cover page. 

Would anybody volunteer to purchase this book and create the cover page? 
?(If  
not, I will do it, but I am not particularly creative with this kind of  
thing.) ?Please let me know and please have your child write the letter to  
Mrs. Blair. 

Please call me or email me if you have any questions or can volunteer your  
assistance with anything.

I've only put the deposit down, so I can get that money back if we decide to 
do the Blue Fox Farm camp instead.  Hopefully, we'll have that info the first 
week in May.  Marla is planning on signing up Blakely for the second session 
there, pending what the Blue Fox Farm schedule looks like.  I think Anna 
Edelman is also interested.  I left a message with Sue today letting her know 
that I was reserving a spot for Kali at GSWEC just in case the Blue Fox Farm 
doesn't work.

1714,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.",QNEC,,Enron Board of Directors Enron Corp. Savings Plan Plan QNEC Company Matching http://resources.hewitt.com/enron benefits.enron.com

My last e-mail should have read as follows ending with ""volumes"". =20

In the event this is not acceptable, please let me know how you would like=

this Section to read.  With regards to imbalances,  I would direct you to=

section 4.3.  As an example, if  Enron nominates 10MMbtus and only 8 are=20

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

1872,"Answer of PJM Interconnection, LLC., to Motion of New England Public Power 
Systems for Deferral of decision until January 15, 2001.  At issue is whether 
a ruling by the FERC on the merits of PJM as an RTO may set an unfair 
precident that may affect other regional RTO filings.  In their answer PJM 
asks that the FERC not delay action as requested by NEPPS and argues that the 
fact that a decision may be precedential clearly is not a basis for 
withholding a decision.  PJM adds that Commission guidance as a precedent 
would in fact, be beneficial to RTO development.  PJM is also concerned that

Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game agai=
nst Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Bri=
an Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BA=
L  Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspende=
d for four games for violating the NFL's drug and alcohol policy. Lewis' fo=
ur-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allow! ed!=
 to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17=
. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee. =
  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sun=
day's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's f=
eature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wych=
eck , TE TEN  Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is e=
xpected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a =
risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 11/=
16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincin=
nati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual dri=
lls Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite n=
ot being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emm=
itt Smith , RB DAL  Updated 11/16/01 Smith will ret! ur! n to the lineup Su=
nday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right kne=
e. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith wo=
uld ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hamb=
rick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the=
 stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI  Updated 11/16/01 Sand=
ers (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now lis=
ted as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're =
completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' m=
atchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long =
as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 11/16/01 According =
to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's =
game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantas=
y team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace=
 for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's o=
ffense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from =
a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly ba=
sis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down =
somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. Th=
e veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game=
 against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   =
Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday=
's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachi=
eving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his pot=
ential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO  Updated 11/=
16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a g=
ood player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense tha=
t has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.    =
 Aaron Brooks , QB NO  Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San F=
rancisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a b=
it inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes i=
t tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.=
 !   Willie Jackson , WR NO  Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game ag=
ainst San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receivin=
g. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the p=
ass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen =
Davis , RB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginn=
ing the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four g=
ames, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the=
 start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scori=
ng games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of =
late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good mat=
chup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air,=
 but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael We=
stbrook , WR WAS  Updated 11/16! /0!  Westbrook has been inconsistent this =
season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He=
'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so sta=
rting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS  U=
pdated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catch=
ing only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this w=
eekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir =
Hakim , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01  Hakim has been inconsistent in recent wee=
ks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is =
right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so av=
oid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL  Updated 11/=
16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only sco=
red only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secon=
dary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based=
 on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL  Updated =
11/16/01! Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's=
 still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and t=
he formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on=
 his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL  Updated 11/16/01=
 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best =
Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post=
 solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL  Up=
dated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fa=
ntasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end aro=
und the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners =
will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR  Updated 11/16/01=
 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but=
 don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting e=
ither back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR  Updated =
11/16/01 Hayes had on! ly! two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St=
. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting h=
im is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR  Updated 11/16/01 Walls has b=
een held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the bett=
er tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in=
 the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR  Update=
d 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six pa=
sses for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past agai=
nst this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. =
  Brett Favre , QB GB  Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fant=
asy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on S=
unday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week=
.   Bubba Franks , TE GB  Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yarda=
ge numbers, but his seven tou! ch! downs in eight games makes him a valuabl=
e Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is=
 the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroed=
er , WR GB  Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL inj=
ury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a soli=
d play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong p=
assing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commis=

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.

 	I am not sure who prepared the detail schedule for Data Request No. 4, but we have a few questions:

	  The letter agreement dated 2/6/2001, effective November 1, 2001, states 
		1.  Primary points - east to east flow  rate equals $0.025 demand rate and a maximum commodity rate which is 			$0.0147 inclusive of surcharges.   Why does the schedule have $0.0092 as the primary path rate?  Also since the 
		question asks for the transportation charged, we thought we would add the demand rate and the associated MDQ.
		
		2.  Alternate points - east to west flow - rate equals negotiated rate - but in no event shall the resultant commodity be 		less than $0.0246/MMBtu.  Why does the schedule have a rate of $0.0245/MMBtu?

A long, long time ago.... I can still remember, how that stock price used
to make me smile, and I knew if I had my chance, I shouldn't have listened to
those analysts rants, and maybe I'd be happy for a while..... but February
made me shiver, with every option they delivered, bad news in theBoardroom,
I couldn't believe the pending doom, I can't remember if I cried when I
read about Skilling step aside but something nauseated  me from deep inside, the
day, that Enron shareholders, cried. So...
CHORUS
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the sky
then the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their own
supply wailing, ""Why Ask Why"",  This will be the day that they  drink Bud

Did you write off your shares enough or did you have faith in Jeff above,
if the headlines told you so, and do you believe in book-it-n'-roll, can mark
to market save your p&l and can you teach me how to print money on deal
flow? Well I know that you're in not in ruin I saw your balance in the
credit union, you sold off all your shares and I dig those market bears. He
was a lonely boomer CEO with a big old House in River O.  but I knew I was
out some dough, the day, Jeff stepped aside. I started singin...
Chorus

Now for ten years we've been on a roll and all are friends are on the dole
but that's not how it used to be, when the Ken Lay sang for the George and
Barb while Rice screwed Amanda in an rental from Harold Farb,  oh and while
Skilling was looking down, the stock price has made him frown the
shareholder return, has really made him burn, and while he had plenty of
jack, he had lost the knack and had come under attack, , the day, Jeff
stepped aside. We were singin...
Chorus
Helter Skelter in a summer swelter the electricity market was a limit
melter, eight hundred bucks and climbing fast, California credit limit had
quickly past, the governor tried to get some bills past,  Enron's
receivables have quickly amass, now everyone ran to  in Washington, the
lawsuits have just begun, just before the price would fall, Gov. Gray
bought it all, as the dust is settling, will prove that government mettling will
certainly be, a huge catastrophe, the day, Jeff stepped, aside. We started
singin...
Chorus
Oh and there we were all in one place, a company that needed its space with
no floors left to grow, so come on, Jeff be nimble, Jeff be quick, Jeff S.
built a new deodorant stick because hubris the devils only friend, oh and
as I watched that tower build, but I doubt it will ever be filled, no more
recruiting trip; as HR doles out more pink slips; and as the building
climbed high into the sky to quite the contractor delight  I saw
shareholders shuttering with fright, the day, Jeff stepped aside. He was
singin...
Chorus
The burning question that I don't know is who can replace him as CEO cause
the company won't be the same, he transformed the industry his success is
plain to see but from natural gas to electricity, Dynegy tried, and  Duke
has dreamed but I hate to tease, they are just Enron wanna-be's, and in
hindsight its easy to mock his leaving the firm in a shock, I'm just I had
sold my stock, the day, Jeff stepped aside, and they were singin...

Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy 
from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that 
things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't have 
time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As you 
already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys 
lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to some middle 
ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for what its 
worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't 
run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side.

First of our stuff coming to you.

Following attachment is chilling calc for Ft Devens - which was the nearest 
site we thought might be representative of Lowell. I will confirm the 1% 
occurance basis we used (80F DB, 63.5F WB and 40% RH). I calc 790 tons/unit 
hour, we used 812 tons/per in our performance run. Design basis of chilling 
plant in our conceptual EPC would be maybe 3600 total tons (at the 80F/40% 
point) so there would be some margin to meet 50F inlet air at slightly higher 
ambients.



Obviously if you have different design point due to your owm plant data or 
your own criteria, we would be glad to rerun/size based on your suggestion. 
Balls in your court on this. Ft devens data coming to you by epressmail - we 
can also fax (fax number ???)- just 6 sheets - I need to find the procedure 
and/or worksheet on how we got the 1% point - I can't see it in this package.

Water data sheet is attached - obviously list is exhaustive but my water 
doctor asks if your team could fill out as much as possible so we can give 
you our best shot a suggesting a treatment system - might be helpful to have 
my water guy talk with your water guy so they conceptualize the new to fit 
well with the existing



I did get the voicemail, but managed to scribble unintelligebly (can't spell 
either) early this AM - I have Paul B.???? at 978-454-6166 (also hit the 
earse on my mail in my automatic mode this AM. Likely Ron Smith 713-345-5768 
will call.

The following is the data we developed and provided to a possible Austin, 
Texas job. Obviously water is different so unit cost may change but probably 
will keep same pecking order.

 Water options as follows

1) Rental mobile demineralizer    $10.57/1000 gal based on 1500 hrs/yr
2) Rental mobile demin with lease degasifier  $9.75/1000 gas for 5 yr then 
$7.85 on
3) Rental mobile RO with exchange tank mixed beds $7.22/1000 gal
4) Purchase RO with exchange tank mixed beds  $4.75/1000 gal
5) Purchase demineralizer    $5.77/1000 gal

Options 3, 4 and 5 require wastewater discharge. All systems assume on-site 
water storage. design is that system would run 22-24 hrs per day to make 
enough water for 10 hr daily run. Can run 24 hr+ with tank dropping. 
Generally these should be concidered as 1 X 100% unit (capable of supporting 
10 hr day) - if run more, truck water from Decker, call for emergency trailer 
demin, can operate units on limited water but would see NOx increase 

I need to run performance by our management and then get Tom's blessing 
before I send.

Best data I have on water consumption is that with 50F CTG inlet air at 
sealevel, nozzle water flow will be 22379 lb/hr and Sprint flow will be 2,206 
lb/hr. Our S&S guarantee says +/- 20% on nozzle flow, no info on possible 
+/-% on Sprint - I will ask S&S for clarification ASAP. Cooling tower water 
consumption obviously follows chilling load and cycles of 
concentration/blowdown program - water dependent!! we are conceptually using 
about 60 gpm/unit for demin.

Mr. Brown: 
My name is Ben Rogers and I am currently applying to The Texas Business 
School for enrollment in the Fall of 2000.  I was referred to you by David 
Martin, graduate of the Business School and the son of John Martin, former 
Finance Professor.  I have worked with David at Enron for a couple of years 
and have learned a lot about the School.  I also was referred to you by Kyle 
Kettler, who graduated from the Business School in 1998 and who worked in the 
investment fund.  I have been working in several different finance positions 
within Enron for the last two and a half years. Before coming to Enron I 
worked for three years in a portfolio management group with State Street Bank 
in Boston. I am very interested in the combination of energy and corporate 
finance and have the desire to continue working in these industries after 
business school. I am also very interested in the investment fund.  I feel 
that with my prior experience with State Street Bank, I could contribute a 
great deal to the fund.  I am coming to visit the school on Friday, Feb. 18th 
and was wondering if you had time to talk to me about the Investment Fund.  
If you could please let me know if your available, I would greatly appreciate 
it.  If your not available that day, I would still like to talk with you 
about the program.  You can either e-mail me back or you can reach me at 
Enron in Houston at (713) 853-7998.  Please let me know if you want me to 
send you my resume, so that you have a better understanding of my background.

For tomorrow, see the attached schedule.     This is what is communicated to Frontera.     The mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour.   The Resource Plan shuold be identical to this row.       Row 5 mirrors the purchase from Frontera in Enpower.     The Mirant call and Enron's call (Ercot Asset Book - 100 mw's) are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of Frontera.    Please familiarize yourself with this report    

The top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales,  etc.    Additionally,   the Resource Plan needs to accurately reflect to Ercot what the plant is capable of.  For example,   if we are generating at the maximum of 450 mw's,  we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 1-3   do not exceed this amount.

Otherwise,  Ercot thinks they can OOM you up.


Specifically for tomorrow,   please note that we are going from 135 mw hour ending 6 to 250 mw's hour ending 7.     The plant doesnt like to do this.  A 200 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp.
So either :
1.  purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7.    Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only.  Put purchase from  in  Teco Services book.
Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book.   If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7.
2. have plant drag  and buy imbalance - they will call to make this decision.  No entries will be needed.

Call if you have questions.

told him that I would be that contact.  He said that in the next few days he
would be sending me a letter requesting that documents be preserved.  That
will be followed in 2-3 weeks by a subpoena.  He anticipated a 3 week period
to respond to the subpoena.  Enron is not the only entity that has been
contacted.

 Dave Noonan, Mike Kirby, Mike Day and I will try to figure out who
is representing whom in San Diego.
Removal
 Diversity
  Mike Kirby pointed out that even if we solved the
citizenship issue, it is unlikely that every class member will meet the
$75,000 amount in controversy requirement.  We also have the preliminary
reports that Sempra Energy Resources is a California corporation that is
selling electrical energy into the California PX market. (See December 1
status report.) I need to followup and find out if Sempra Energy Resources
has outside counsel yet and confirm their understanding on this issue.
 Federal Question and Related Primary Jurisdiction Argument
  All of us need to understand the interrelationship between
the FERC/PUC/ISO investigations and this class action.  There is also the
pending challenge to the ISO MMIP's by Enron and others that has been
pending for some time.  Does the complaint fairly raise or necessarily
implicate a federal question.
Change of Venue  (Additional Research by Peter Meringolo)

 I have researched case law involving class actions where class
members are jurors.  I found only two non-California cases, and both involve
change of venue motions.  See Beech v. Leaf River Forest Prods., 691 So. 2d
446 (Miss. 1997); Toledo Fair Hous. Ctr. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 704
N.E.2d 663 (Ohio Ct. Com. Pl. 1996).  These cases, however, do not change
the analysis required under C.C.P. o 397(b).

 In Beech, plaintiffs brought a non-class action lawsuit against
defendants for polluting two rivers with dioxin.  Defendants moved for a
change of venue.  In addition to evidence of negative publicity, defendants
showed that of the 8,909 potential jurors, 750 were plaintiffs in other
dioxin cases against these defendants, and ""even more were potential class
members in a class action brought against these same defendants"" in another
county.  Beech, 691 So. 2d at 450.  The trial court granted defendants'
motion because the negative publicity and the large number of jurors
involved in similar litigation ""would prevent the defendants from receiving
a fair trial.""  Id.  The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed, holding that
the trial court did not abuse its discretion.  Id.

 Toledo Fair involved a class action against Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Company.  Nationwide moved for a change of venue, arguing, among
other things, that because of the large size of the class ""a significant
percentage of veniremen would be either class members or relatives of class
members and would thus be ineligible to sit as jurors.""  Toledo Fair, 704
N.E.2d at 664.  Plaintiffs argued that Nationwide exaggerated the size of
the class.  Id.  The court denied the motion, holding that because of the
dispute regarding the size of the class, it was too early to determine
whether an impartial jury could be impaneled.  The court clearly left open
the possibility for Nationwide to renew this motion.

 We also discussed the remote possibility of challenging the judge
who would hear this case under Section 170.1, for cause, because the Judge
would be part of the class.  Dave Noonan has had experience in the egg case
with this type of challenge.
Consolidation
 Dave and Mike will look at how to manage a consolidation with Judge
Amos under San Diego local rules, if that is what we decided to do.  Keeping
in mind that the 17200 claims are not jury claims, the selection of the
judge is critical.
Coordination with Defense Counsel
 Dave and Mike will be responsible with Robin for coordinating among
defense counsel in San Diego.  Right now, we do not intend to enter any
formal defense sharing agreements.
Coordination with Plaintiffs' Counsel
 Dave and Mike with Robin will be responsible for coordinating our
efforts with lead plaintiffs' counsel.
Analysis of FERC/PUC Enron Positions
 Robin will work with me to understand from Ron Carroll (FERC) and
Mike Day (PUC), what positions that Enron has taken with respect to

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION'S REPORT

The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis' remarks on the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) report:

""My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity
affordable. That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this
complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in. I believe we are making
a good start.

""Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in
San Diego, and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable
power resources, like the photovotaic program you see behind us, to support
financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs
up and down the state to reduce California's use of electricity by 10% when
we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a
number of industries, including the technology and grocery industry that
reduce the demand on any given day.

""Having said all that, this market is dysfunctional. It is a very difficult
environment for deregulation to work. And I repeat again, deregulation can
work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is
competitive, which it is not.

""I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this
market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial
reports of the action that FERC took today. It is a mixed blessing. They do
recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree
that the rates are not just or reasonable. However, they did not, as I
encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who
were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that
San Diego had to suffer through.

""FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISO-independent
service operator, and the power exchange. FERC agrees with me that they are
self-serving and either contributed to or participated directly in market
manipulation. However, it is unclear what will replace those boards. The
good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is
dysfunctional, rates are unreasonable and unjust. The bad news is there is
no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California.

""I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going
to be a prisoner of ideology. I do not want some knee jerk reactions to
drive our economy or our consumers to their knees. I have seen time and
again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say, 'please give
us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon
us.' So as I have long understood, economics drives politics and at the
moment we are shipping about $6 billion more out of this state for
electricity than we paid about 12 months ago. That has got to stop.

Question inaudible.

""It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this
again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with. Once the state
deregulated distribution from power generation in 1996, the PUC basically
surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of
electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision
today, they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake
holder members and they think that is ill advised, as do I. There will be
new boards established and we will tell you how they are established. So it
is unclear whether we have the authority to, independent of the FERC to
establish our own ISO and power exchange. My initial reading of the press
reports suggest that we may not. That is something that has to be cleared up
over the next several days.

Question inaudible.

""We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of
stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators, other consumer groups
from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate
the path that we will take. I am not at the point where I can tell you what
that consensus is. But we are making progress.

Question inaudible.

""That we are going to fight for consumers, that they should not bear the
full brunt of this experiment in deregulation. At best it was premature and
the market place was not prepared. The marketplace is dysfunctional, it is
not competitive. There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can
generate in this state. I want them to know that we are working night and
day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs
for this ill-conceived scheme.

""I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is
dysfunctional, recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable. I am not
pleased that they have not offered any solutions. It looks like we are going
to have to wait until November 9th at the hearing in front of FERC at which
their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment,
critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted
in full or in part. This is a very important meeting in which our
administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the
consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not
before.

""I believe refunds are due and necessary. FERC and the Secretary of Energy
have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and
reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds. It is
unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not. Congress
could settle

the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that. Over the long
haul, by that I mean 5 to 10 to 15 years, I believe deregulation can work
but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act
responsibly. As I told everyone involved in this process, some people may
win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and
citizen of this state. The people of California will stand up; they will
rise up and take matters into their own hands. The problem with deregulation
lowering rates, is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the
immediate horizon.

Question inaudible.

""Let me just say two things. I think there is plenty of blame to go around
but there is no question that the generators who happen to be out-of-state
companies are charging us 600 to 700% more for the very same electricity
that we purchased last year. You cannot add value to an electron. An
electron is an electron. They are simply taking advantage of an ill-advised
scheme envisioned in the 1996 act to charge what the market will bear. I am
standing up and saying no more. We are not going to take this lying down. We
are fighting back. The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we
used to have. The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson
signed the deregulation bill. Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored
by Steve Peace, they were the two driving forces as they will be happy, well
maybe not so happy, to acknowledge. It may have seemed like a good idea in
1996 but I did not participate in that debate and I don't have a comment on
whether it was a good idea then. But clearly in the year 2000 it is not a
good idea. Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some
limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the
generators which is about 35-40% of their facilities that they used to own
and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out
of state generators that purchased them. FERC has control over them and it
is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own
power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted. There is no
question about that. They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous
and do not represent consumer interests. Plus you cannot hold anyone
accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards. You
cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of
electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state. So
these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no
public official participates on those boards.

Question inaudible.

""You are more right than wrong. As the chief executive of this state I am
going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers
and businesses. Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy. Without water
and electricity, consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck.
Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in 1996 made sense then is a
question not worth debating today. But it does not make sense today.
Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in
1996 surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to
monitor and supervise. So it is unclear how much power is left to the state.
FERC seems to be suggesting

today, not much. Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as
much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable
and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility
that is laid at my doorstep.

""I have one goal in mind: to do our level best to make sure that our lights
stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the
prices are reasonable. What path we take to that matters less to me than
that we get to that result. Because that is the result that is necessary to
allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a
profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn
provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the
environment and provide healthcare. Without electricity there is no economic
growth, without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice
to our public obligations. Thank you for coming out here today.

After talking with Terry, Darrell, and the team, the following procedures have been developed so that each team member is consistent and all pertinent information is properly documented.

Darrell is going to set the Socal Capacity in CAS to its Operational Capacity (850000), therefore, from now on we should only update the Socal window in TMS, and opt not to send the capacity from TMS to CAS when asked.  In addition, we should continue to update the comments section in CAS each cycle for the Socal Window
For all other points, when updating Capacities in TMS, the changed capacity should be sent to CAS only if it is a change in Operational Capacity.  If we are updating for any other reason, (flow rate etc...) those capacities should not be sent back to CAS.
In conclusion, from now on we will only update capacities in TMS and we will only send changes to CAS or make changes in CAS if there is a change in Operational Capacity, which will probably be a decision made by Darrell.  The Socal Capacity in CAS and online is 850000 however we will continue to document the Window in the CAS Comments, and update it in TMS.

These procedures will be effective for the Timely of Gas Day 10/25/01.

If you have any questions, please ask me.

2018,"I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run
the pigs.  It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams
possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.  I had them pull moisture readings and they
were well below TW's  #7 of water.  They said it was more like drip.  This heavies are in the gas stream
that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.  I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes.
We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen.
If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.  Please let me know.

costs as well as the actual gas costs.  This cost is usually a 1% percent of 
injection volume charge to the book itself.  The total cost would be the 
actual electric compressor expenses which could be a lot higher than 1% of 
the volumes injected.  The more changes or swings in volume on the electric 
compressors the higher the compressor cost.

Royalties and Production costs are usually paid on withdrawal volumes.  I 
believe we will have withdrawn all the gas before the transfer to AEP.  The 
gas is assumed to be withdrawn according to the current withdrawal schedule 
by 3/31/20001.

There may be cost associated ad valorem.  We will have working gas thru 
February and go into cuhion gas in march.  Ad valorem is paid on cushion and 
working gas.  We are usually charges based on the volume of gas as of 
December 31st.  This is a negotiated payment.  Ted Ryan is more able to 
answer these issuesor questions.  The date the inventory levels are assessed 
is not always December.  It can change in negotiations.  Ted Ryan can answer 
if the date for 2001 is firm or not. 

The third party storage contracts we are curently using in bammel are Texas 
General Land Office and Cannon interesst.  Cannon was assigned to Kinder 
Morgan.
We also have Bammel balances in different intercompany ENA contracts  As of 
November 2000 Production ENA contracts had 22,192,745 mmbtu's of working gas 
volumes and 11,891,487 mmbtu as HPLC.  The December production schedule 6 is 
not out yet.  Usually all current activity is scheduled as HPL.  Pma's can 
affect the ENA balances.  These pma's are usually minimal.    Chris Price and 
Rita Wynne can supply the contract numbers for the contracts we have volumes 
under in Bammel.  There are other contracts on file with the railroad 
commission like El Paso, Sempra, etc. according to Irene Flynn.  These 
contract should be terminated.  The balances are zero.  Some of these 
contracts were never used.  Jackie Morgan should terminated these contracts. 
These contracts do not automatically terminate since they are basic 
contracts.  These basic contracts specify the rates and terms in attachments 
to the contract as confirms.  There no confirms with terms other than Texas 
General & Cannon/Kinder Morgan.

The only other issues I can think of is balance sheet items unidentified in 
OA.  There is a large unexplained variance for November production.  This 
balance is usually due to confusion between which deals are financial and 
which are physical and problems due to the regions they are liquidated in.  
Once the unexplained variances are identified, most of variances are 
reclassed and get corrected.  I assume the same thing will happed for 
November production, however, we can not be sure until the process is 
completed.     Dave Baumbach, John Valdes, and Jody Crook are looking at 
these variances and trying to clear up the back page items.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

The Commission did require Koch to separately state any option fee 
arrangements when making its negotiated rate filings for deals that include 
option fees.  The Commission also stressed that an option fee annot guarantee 
capacity and therefore does not amount to a request for transportation 
service.

Koch has made three negotiated rate filings involving option fees.  In the 
first such filing, Koch explained that the proposed negotiated rates were 
comprised of two parts:  an option fee and an index-based usage rates.  
Because Koch did not specify the index price formula, the Commission required

ENERGY
        Philosophers search for truth in much the same way that artists
do. They don't really expect to find any definite answers. They mainly want
to provide and investigate more ways of looking at the world. But scientists
differ slightly. Science strives to provide very definite, measurable and
provable truths. In the back of their minds though, scientists understand that
those truths are only temporary, and that they may very well be replaced
someday by another truth. So they're really not so different from artists
and philosophers after all.

        Einstein's Theory of Relativity has been accepted as a scientific
truth. But it has so far not been found to mesh with quantum physics. It
may very well be that the 21st century will modify one or both of those
truths as well. So for the time being, we can look at energy as mass times
the speed of light times the speed of light. From another point of view,
energy is the capability of a body to do work or produce an effect. It's
possible that the second definition will outlast the first.

2055,"You have asked me to outline the argument that would be used in requesting a 
motion to expedite the Commission's decision in this proceeding.  The motion 
would be filed pursuant to Rule 212 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and 
Procedure, which simply allows parties to file motions.  Sempra is not yet a 
party, so it would have to include in its pleading a motion to intervene out 
of time.  The Commission may grant late interventions pursuant to Rule 214 if 
the movant has good cause for failing to file the motion on time, permitting 
the intervention will cause no significant disruption of the proceeding, the 
movant's interest is not adequately represented by other parties in the 
proceeding, and no prejudice to other parties would result from granting late 
intervenor status.  Additionally, like other intervenors, Sempra must also 
explain its interest in the proceeding, including why it has a right to 
participate, why it could be directly affected by the outcome of the 
proceeding, and that its participation in the proceeding would be in the 
public interest.  (We've seen numerous interventions by Sempra and they have 
some standard language they use in their interventions to describe the 
company and request intervenor status).   

The basis for requesting expedited status of the SWGas application would be 
that Sempra's Gallup Expansion transport agreement includes a provision ",Sempra,,Commission Sempra SWGas Gallup

The contract is such that the shipper would not have been entitled to a ROFR

935 bc she her house had flooded this morning and had to make some phone
calls to get things under control.  I was able at least to get the ball
rolling...however I did not get into my huge screwup.  I just started with
what I am feeling now..and why I am here in Utah...a little family
stuff...but no relationship/personal stuff.  She of course asked about
medication and I said I did not want to go that route unless I became so
blah that I couldn't leave the house or go to work...told her..I wasn't
there.  So I told her about my change in diet, no caffeine, no alcohol.  She
thought those were great things.  She advised me to attack this cold...ie:
get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise....aerobic exercise in
particular.  She said that it is aerobic, not the anaerobic (weights,yoga)
that are most effective for the funk.  So I bought some echinacea extract
and some echinacicia/zinc lozenges and today i'm gonna continue rest (will
nap this afternoon)...and I should hopefully be good to get a nice snowshoe
hike in the morning before I work tomorrow.

So thats it.  We have an apt on next tues.  I hope to get into everything
else at that point...there was so little time today.  She said DV pays for 8
appointments...so that made me happy.  I think 8 should make a good dent in
things and if I have to fork out a little cash after that point..it should
be worth it.

I'll be back at the cafe at 4 to work.  I'll check email later.  Hope you
are doing well.

favored by at least a touchdown.  So I'll take the Aggies +7.  How about the
loser either picks up the first round or the whole night the next time we
hit the town, although the later might be pretty steep.  Don't know if your
a gambling gal but I thought I would at least present this opportunity to
you.

Anyway, how's the old option book?  Are you getting a handle on the whole
macro thing?  Look on the bright side it is only a three day week and I'm
sure you'll get the whole 40 in.

2067,"Hey Darren,

It's funny you mentioned Wilson because I just got an email from him this 
morning.  He seems to think he'll be in Houston in the near future as well.  
Hopefully, we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some 
cold ones.  So H-town for six weeks hugh?  Why the mixed feelings?  Are they 
work related or were you just starting to get settled in London?  Anyway, 
I'll have to give Nick a call about the big news...I may have an idea what 
it's all about but then again maybe not.  So what's with this Kiwi girl?  
Because, I actually have made some progress regarding London.  Turns out 
there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there 
which would be much more in line with where I'd like my ""career"" to be going 
versus the other opportunities I was being offered.  Either way, I won't be 
going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.

As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really 
to speak of.  I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see 
them going anywhere.  Most of the guys around my age are still pretty 
insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to ""shape and 
mold them"" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.  And 
the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who 
seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.  Oh well, as I've 
said before ""hope springs eternal"".

Talk to you soon,
Susan

This morning, the CPUC approved the Comprehensive PG&E Settlement Agreement,
resolving all issues concerning PG&E in the Gas Strategy Investigation.
Thanks to all of you for your part in making this settlement possible.

The next step is getting the tariffs approved.  PG&E sent out a first draft
of the tariffs on March 28, 2000, and then held a tariff workshop on April
10, 2000.  We will send out a revised draft next week, on the 25th, which
will take into account suggestions many of you made on the prior draft.  We
will then hold half-day tariff workshop on Tuesday, June 13th.  We must file
the tariffs with the CPUC by July 17, 2000.  A detailed schedule for
completion of these tariffs is attached.

Pursuant to your instructions regarding procedures for serving testimony and
preparing exhibits, I submit the following information on behalf of Long

a,  List of exhibits

    Long Beach intends to offer two exhibits:  Ex. 200, the prepared direct
testimony   of Elizabeth Wright, and Ex. 201, the prepared rebuttal testimony
of  Elizabeth Wright.

b.  estimate of direct and cross-examination time

    Long Beach estimates only a few minutes of direct examination.

    Regarding cross-examination, Long Beach's estimates are necessarily
preliminary and incomplete (apparently I did not receive all of the direct
testimony) in light of the recent filing of rebuttal testimony.  Current
estimates   are as follows:

    Ladd Lorenz, SoCalGas - 4 hr.

2084,"I've discussed the ""actual fuel"" provision with Christine and Bob and made 
them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be 
filed, since the FTS-1 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be 
made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets.  

According to Bob's calculations, the actual fuel used by Duke under this 
contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff.

I don't think FERC or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection 
to our charging actual fuel.  However, I know that fuel is a sensitive issue 
on TW so I wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision.  Let 
me know what you think.

2085,"Mark's synopsis pretty well says it all.  Once again, the CPUC is in a panic 
and is attempting to change the rules in the middle of the game.  I'm not 
sure I can make as clear a connection as Mark has between the actions of 
interstate pipelines, particularly Transwestern, who, basically, are allowed 
to charge just a tariff rate for upstream transport, and the huge dislocation 
of basis spread between producing area and California border.  Therefore, I 
don't necessarily see us being sullied by the El Paso issue.  I think our 
biggest PR problem is probably our affiliation with Enron Online.

We'll continue to monitor this situation.  One thing is clear... fireworks 
will certainly be forthcoming when the QF's are being paid on a formula 
weighted predominantly with basin pricing, rather than border prices.  Not to 
be be too esoteric here, but remember, there are a number of factors at 
play.  QF's by contract are obligated to produce electricity when called on. 
They are paid capacity payments by the utilities for that purpose.  It will 
be interesting to see how many of the QF's tell Edison, PG&E, SDG&E, et al. 
to go ""fly a kite"" when they know that if they produce a MW of electricity, 
their commodity payments will put them under water.

              COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA 
                            ELECTRICITY MARKETS

          In response to emergency conditions that exist in the
     California electricity markets, which have faced supply shortages
     and snowballing prices, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
     today approved a price cap change requested by the California
     Independent System Operator (ISO).   The Commission also took
     steps to permit qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full
     capacity.

          The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. 
     Bids above that amount will be allowed but will not set the
     clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase
     price cap.  This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic
     supply shortages.  
          
          Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their
     bids to the Commission on a weekly basis and provide certain cost
     information.  

          The non-profit ISO and PX began operations in California in
     1998.  The PX is the scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well
     as other market participants.   The ISO operates and controls
     most of the transmission system in California.

          In addition to the $250 purchase price cap, the Commission
     also authorized the ISO to penalize participating generators that
     refuse to operate in response to an ISO request in an emergency.  
     They will be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price
     the ISO paid for energy for each hour in which the participating
     generator failed to respond.   

          The ISO's costs of obtaining energy through bids above the
     purchase price cap or through out-of-market dispatches will be
     assigned to scheduling coordinators who depend too much on spot
     markets.

          The Commission's second order enables QF entities to
     generate at full capacity which in the past could have caused
     them to lose QF status.  QF generators are small power producers
     that use alternative fuels, such as solar or biomass, and
     cogenerators that produce both electricity and steam for
     commercial use.   

          The order on QF entities was in response to a request from a
     California QF.

          The orders are effective immediately.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

Have you provided Mike Minnich with a revised marked-up copy of the Agreement 
for Prime Brokerage Clearing Services which incorporates my suggested changes

Has Sara developed a framework regarding notification (i.e. who, how, lead

Are you and Sara comfortable with Mike Minnich's 9/21 proposal regarding 
jurisdiction ?

Per Mike's 9/21 email, he wanted to discuss the issue of consequential 
damages.  Has this issue been resolved ?

Trading Edge:

Are you encountering resistance regarding any issues you and Dan Brooks have 
been discussing ?

LIMITrader:

Have you been able to email the electronic version of agreements back to Jim 
Kopley with our comments ?  If so, could I get a copy ?

I just learned from our sales person, Doug Ford, that Jim Kopley may no 
longer be the appropriate contact with LIMITrader.  I will email you 
additional information when I hear back from Doug.

Regarding Trading Edge and LIMITrader, do you know if we will be required to 
execute an Agreement for Prime Brokerage Clearing Services ?  If so, I assume 
we will propose the modified version that we will execute with Buy Side

(2)  Paul advises that you will be transacting pursuant to the existing ISDA 
Master Agreement between ENA and CSFB Int'l (name change from Credit Suisse 
Financial Products).  In that regard, you should be sure to add the following 
items to the confirmation and discuss with your counterparty:

 (a)  ENA should be the Calculation Agent for purposes of this transaction.

 (b)  You should provide for ""Payments on Early Termination"" as:  ""For the 
purpose of Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement,  (i)  Loss will apply, 
and (ii) the Second Method will apply.""

Also, you should obtain evidence of the name change (usually a certificate of 
name change).

comment when you sent it, Sara [which I promptly forgot to do].  Anyway, we 
might consider whether the provisions under ""Regulation M/Tender Offer Event"" 
ought to be deleted from any 'sample' confirmation or be in a different 
form.  Those particular provisions were put in, I believe, by Lehman.  I've 
seen other forwards that didn't hit those concepts at all, and some that 
covered them generally under the caption 'disruption event' or captioned 
'extension event'--but I am not sure which type of provision [or none] is 
best for Enron.  If it is best to delete, we should probably do that in any 
sample we adopt.  If other provisions would be better for Enron, we ought to 
utilize those.  What do you each think?  If you do have a thought one way or

Per Sheila's inquiry and at Sara's direction, I called Ken Raisler at 
Cadwalader to determine if using the word ""exchange"" in a corporation's name 
would create any regulatory problems with the CFTC.

Per Ken, there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word 
""exchange"" .  As we may have noticed though, a lot more companies are doing 
so without concern.  He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in 
using ""exchange"" in your corporate name, however, putting ""exchange"" in a 
company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny.

He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong, 
so if we ever anticipate doing business there, it might not be a good idea.",Sara Ken Raisler Per Ken,,FYI CFTC

2170,"I am not sure it solves matters.  Stikemans opinion points out:

1.  as I indicated this morning, ""money"" means actual currency - notes and 
coins - not funds transferred by wire into an account, which would likely be 
treated as an ""intangible"" resulting in the various requirements/concerns I 
pointed to this morning regarding perfection by registration;

2.  although, in their view, the validity of the transfer approach would be 
recognized by a court (in Ontario at least), given that the intention of the 
Transfer Annex is to provide security for contingent obligations under the 
Master Agreement and the lack of relevant case law, there is a material risk 
that the Court would nonetheless characterize the transfer as a security 
interest subject to the requirements for perfection.

With our present understanding, in the absence of any definitive case law, 
and without an unequivocal opinion we can rely on, I am not sure we can rely 
on the transfer approach to solve the problem, particularly with high volume 
counterparties who likely are going to create the largest exposures.

I have been doing some background research on whether we can use 
administrative proceedings at the FERC, State Commissions, the SEC (Public

E.On's anticompetitive activities in Germany.  As I mentioned earlier, 
Enron's ability to use US federal and state regulatory proceedings to 
leverage change in Germany is limited and could backfire on Enron.

For example, the standard used by the FERC to approve acquisitions of public 
utilities subject to its jurisdiction is limited in scope and does not allow 
us to intervene as an interested party simply because we have problems in 
Germany.  

I think the best course of action is to highlight this as a general Germany - 
US trade issue and get both the USG and the Congress interested.  There may 
also be some scope for raising this as a political issue in states where E.On 
is proposing an acquisition (let's hope they try to buy a Texas utility).

I have been trading calls with the German expert at USTR and I also have 
ameeting tomorrow with the Dept. of Commerce where I will have an opportunity 
to raise this issue. When you are here in august I can schedule other

FLORIDA -- Staff proposes tandem interconnect rate rules

The Public Service Commission staff has recommended rules for 
determining when incumbents must pay competitive local exchange 
carriers the tandem-interconnection rate for reciprocal 
compensation.  Competitors that don't qualify for the tandem-
interconnection rate are paid the cheaper end-office switching 
rate for reciprocal compensation. 

A competitor is entitled to receive the incumbent's tandem 
interconnection rate when its switch either ""serves a comparable 
geographic area to that served by an [incumbent's] tandem switch, 
or performs functions similar to those performed by an 
[incumbent's] tandem switch,"" the staff said.

A competitor ""serves"" a comparable geographic area when it has 
deployed a switch and has opened ""NXXs"" to serve the exchanges 
within the area, the staff said.  The staff rejected BellSouth 
Telecommunications, Inc.'s and Verizon Florida, Inc.'s argument 
that competitors must ""serve"" actual customers within a 
comparable geographic area.  FCC rules permit competitors to 
qualify for the tandem interconnection rate if they serve ""a 
comparable geographic area, not a comparable customer base within 
this area,"" the staff said.

A ""comparable geographic area"" includes an area that is ""roughly 
the same size in comparison but not necessarily identical"" to the 
area served by an incumbent's tandem switch, the staff said.  
Similar functionality is trunk-to-trunk switching, the staff 
said.  The commission is scheduled to vote on the staff's 
recommendation Dec. 5.  (Docket 000075-TP)

______________________________________________________

ARIZONA -- Cable TV providers to link networks

A group of about 11 cable TV providers operating in Arizona have 
established a consortium called First Mile Arizona to link up 
their networks.  The consortium was launched by Cox 
Communications, Inc., the state's largest cable TV operator, in 
cooperation with the Arizona Cable Television Association (ACTA).  

ACTA Executive Director Susan Bitter Smith told TR that the 
consortium consisted of large and midsize cable TV companies that 
use combinations of hard wire and microwave facilities to serve 
their customers.  She said the first link of the statewide 
network would be activated in the eastern part of Arizona during 
first-quarter 2002.  She added that connecting the northern part 
of the state would be the next milestone.

The statewide network plan stemmed from an ASP (application 
service provider) contract Cox was awarded by the state.  Under 
the $28 million contract, Cox will provide ASP services to state 
school facilities, which includes close to one million users, a 
staff member from the Arizona Telecommunications & Information 
Council (ATIC) told TR.  

The contact also obliged Cox to deliver these services statewide 
although the company doesn't offer services everywhere in the 
state.  The consortium will help Cox fulfill its contract with 
the state by providing a network for its ASP services.  

Ms. Bitter Smith said the consortium plans to do more than just 
providing ASP services to the school systems.  She added that the 
consortium may help bring cable TV services to unserved parts of 
the state.

TEXAS -- Small ILECs oppose CPNI 'win-back' restrictions

The Texas Statewide Telephone Cooperative, Inc., has asked the 
Public Utility Commission to eliminate a rule prohibiting telecom 
carriers from using a former customer's CPNI (customer 
proprietary network information) to ""win back"" customers who have 
switched their service to another provider.  

The PUC has proposed revising its CPNI rules to make them 
consistent with recent changes to FCC rules.  (10/22/01)  The PUC 
requested comments on whether the FCC's rules permit telecom 
providers to use a former customer's CPNI to ""win back"" 
customers.  The FCC's rules permit carriers to use a former 
customer's CPNI to regain that customer's business, the 
cooperative said.  The cooperative represents 19 telecom 
cooperatives and 16 small commercially owned telecom companies.  
(Project 22490)

NEW YORK -- PSC mulls putting UNE rate case on hold

The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by Nov. 28 
discussing whether its unbundled network element (UNE) rate case 
should be postponed for a limited time.  The PSC staff filed 
comments last week asking that the UNE case be held in abeyance 
""to permit the parties in the two captioned proceedings to 
fashion a comprehensive resolution. . .through a negotiated 
process.""  (Case 00-C-1945 and 98-C-1357)

______________________________________________________

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC sets carrier-to-carrier guidelines

The Public Service Commission has adopted new carrier-to-carrier 
(C2C) guidelines based on a Verizon Washington, D.C., Inc., 
proposed model.  The C2C guidelines measure Verizon's performance 
in providing operations support systems and other services to 
competitive local exchange carriers.

The new guidelines are based on metrics adopted last year by the 
New York Public Service Commission, but they were modified to 
""reflect systems and conditions in the District of Columbia that 
varied from those in New York.""  (12/19/00)  The new guidelines 
are in effect now, but plans related to the C2C reporting 
requirements and performance assurance plans, which were 
submitted by Verizon and AT&T Corp., are under still under 
consideration by the PSC.  (Case 990, In the Matter of the 
Development of Local Exchange Carrier Quality of Service 
Standards for the District, Order 12230)

CALIFORNIA -- ALJ sets hearings on state LD entry requirements

A Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge has 
scheduled hearings for Dec. 3-5 to discuss Pacific Bell's 
compliance with the instate interLATA (local access and transport 
area) market-entry requirements in the California code.  

Section 709.2 directs the PUC to find that permitting Pacific 
Bell to enter the California interLATA market poses no 
substantial harm to the interexchange market.  The commission 
also must find that Pacific Bell's entry is based on fully open 
local exchange access and that the company isn't engaging in 
anticompetitive behavior or improper cross-subsidization.  
(5/7/01)

The ALJ said she set the hearings because several parties 
requested them.  The ALJ limited the parties to only presenting 
arguments that highlight the central points of their written 
comments, which were submitted in August.  She said no new 
evidence could be presented and parties that didn't submit 
comments therefore won't be able to participate in the hearings.

The hearings will begin with a presentation by Pacific Bell.  The 
other parties will respond in accordance with their August 
comments, and Pacific Bell will have an opportunity to reply.  
Parties interested in arguing more than one issue must send a 
list to the ALJ by Nov. 28.  (Rulemakings 93-04-003 and 95-04-043 
and Investigations 93-04-002 and 95-04-044)

ARKANSAS -- SBC begins offering LD service

SBC Long Distance, a Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. affiliate, 
today began offering long distance service to residential and 
business customers in Arkansas.  SBC already offers long distance 
service in Connecticut, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.

Residential customers who pay no monthly fee will pay 10 cents-
per-minute for interstate long distance calls and 12 cents-per-
minute for intrastate long distance calls.  Customers who pay a 
$4.95 monthly fee qualify for a 7 cents-per-minute rate for 
interstate and intrastate long distance calls.  Customers may 
also pay $24.95 per month for 500 minutes of long distance 
service, which equals about 5 cents-per-minute.  Calls that 
exceed the 500-minute threshold are billed at 7 cents-per-minute.

Business customers that subscribe to the company's local and long 
distance service qualify for a 7 cents-per-minute rate for 
interstate long distance calls and a 9 cents-per-minute rate for 
intrastate long distance calls.  Businesses that spend more than 
$50 a month on long distance service are charged 6-8.9 cents-per-
minute for switched long distance service and 4.2-7 cents-per-
minute for dedicated long distance service.  The rate depends on 
the customer's call volume and term commitment.  

The FCC authorized SBC to offer interLATA (local access and 
transport area) long distance services in Missouri and Arkansas 
beginning Nov. 26.  SBC's application to provide long distance 
service in Missouri is pending before the Missouri Public Service 
Commission, which is scheduled to vote on it Nov. 27.

SOUTH DAKOTA -- Telecom complaints top list

The Public Utilities Commission has received more than 164 
telecom complaints since its Nov. 8 meeting, compared to about 21 
electricity complaints and 16 natural gas complaints.

The telecom complaints included billing issues, telemarketing 
concerns, unauthorized billing, poor service, increased telephone 
rates, and ""slamming.""  Slamming is the unauthorized switch of a 
customer's telecom carrier.

The PUC received 2,721 consumer complaints during 2001 and 
addressed or resolved 2,571.

TEXAS -- American Lightwave rolls out national, reverse DA

American Lightwave Communications, Inc., has started offering its 
local service customers national and reverse directory assistance 
for $1.25 per call.  Reverse directory assistance provides the 
name and address associated with ""published"" phone numbers. 

______________________________________________________

NEVADA -- PUC to hear Global NAPs, Sprint dispute 

The Public Utilities Commission has scheduled a Dec. 11 hearing 
to consider an interconnection dispute between Global NAPs, Inc., 
and Central Telephone Co.- Nevada, d/b/a Sprint of Nevada.  
(11/05/2001)

The disputed issues include (1) whether either party should be 
required to install more than one point of interconnection per 
LATA (local access and transport area), (2) whether each party 
should be responsible for the costs associated with transporting 
telecom traffic to the single point of interconnection, (3) 
whether Sprint's calling area boundaries should be imposed on 
Global NAPs, and (4) whether Global NAPs can assign its customers 
""NXX"" codes that are ""homed"" in a central office switch outside 
of a customer's local calling area.  

Both companies and the PUC staff must file testimony by Dec. 4  
(Docket 01-10018)

MICHIGAN -- PSC mulls Westphalia TSLRIC study

The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by Dec. 28

commission asked parties to comment on the proposed TSLRIC

ALASKA -- Cable Co. wants to exit market

The Cable Co., Inc., has asked the Regulatory Commission of 
Alaska for authority to abandon its cable TV service area in 
Aniak.  The company said it has attempted to sell the utility, 
but added that it was ""improbable"" that such a sale would be 
consummated because of declining demand for cable TV service in 
the Aniak area.

Comments on the request are due Dec. 21.  (Docket U-01-103)

Very helpful and encouraging report.  Sounds like the Gov. and the Consumers Counsel are with us on RTOs.  Would they be willing to write their own letters, I assume separately, to the Ohio congressional delegation? There are several Ohio members on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Is the Consumers Counsel a Democrat (that would help since there are three Ohio Democrats on the committee -- Brown, Strickland and Sawyer?).  Even if he is a Republican, support from within the state would help a great deal.  Thanks.

2210,"Another big victory for Enron in New York! In an Order issued by the NYPSC on 
March 29, the NYPSC has approved a proposal to modify the existing fixed 
backout credit of 2.8 cents per kwh for energy and capacity and replace it 
with a market-based backout credit. The additional retail adder of 0.4 cents 
per kwh would remain.  Load-serving entities (LSEs) will have the option of 
continuing to buy their energy and capacity from RG&E at the market based 
backout credit which will be determined 15 days prior to the beginning of 
each of the two six-month capability periods, and will be based on ""a 
forecast of energy prices derived from Enron Corporation's (Enron) 
EnronOnline trading platform.""  To my knowledge, this is the first occasion 
that a regulatory body has agreed to use Enron Online as an index!  LSEs can 
elect instead to procure their own commodity and get a market-based backout 
credit (MBBC). Under this option, the LSEs will get a market based backout 
credit. However, the Enron online prices for the six months determined as 
above will be reconciled on a lag basis against actual market prices.  The 
PSC has capped the amount of the reconciliation for any LSE to the product of 
the LSE's total load for the calendar year and $0.065 per kwh (PSC staff's 
estimate of RG&E's embedded power supply cost).  (The PSC Order actually says

$0.065.) A copy of the PSC's Order is available on its website:

2213,"The following are?summaries of today's appearance by  Sen. John Burton to the 
Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this  afternoon announcing a 
lawsuit against FERC.
?
John Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at  a?lunch with the 
Sacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about  the Edison MOU, 
which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee  for review, 
the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the  Natural 
Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.?  (One 
columnist commented that Burton would ""love it to death,"" meaning it would  
get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance.)
?
The MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight  by the PUC.? 
He said that will not be the case when it leaves the  Senate.
?
Burton is obviously troubled by?the MOU; he said ""some  people"" say it 
doesn't just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.?  He said the 
following would have to take place for the MOU to be  acceptable:
?

Back debt must be verified;
All creditors must take a 30% ""haircut"";
The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an  amount close to 
what the governor has mentioned;
$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay  back debt.

?
When asked whether $400 million was enough, he said ""no"" and  that he feels 
the parent should pay ""a ton.""? That led to a discussion of  the dedicated 
rate component, which he doesn't like.?He used  the example that if 
electricity costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is  $5, if prices drop 
to $10 people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.? A  larger infusion of 
cash from Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the  dedicated rate 
component. 
?
Burton called?the dedicated rate component a ""big  problem"" and said it could 
be the strongest argument for use in an initiative  campaign.
?
He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that  the state should 
set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything  more (note:? 
this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support  from radio talk 
shows and other media).? He later threw out the number  $200.? The state is 
going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top  dollar, he said, so this 
is one way he sees to fight back.? It's tough  medicine, but as he put it, 
""You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy,  but two days later 
you're over it and your stomach's OK.""
?
Burton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how  he believe the 
situation should be handled:? ""The only way to deal with  exploiters is to 
terrorize the bastards.""
?
Asked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU,  Burton said the 
MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing  progress there 
are allowances that would let the process go as long as into  December.
?
?
LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE
?
Shortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to  announce a 
lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the 
Ninth Circuit.? A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier  this 
afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.? If  
additional copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.
?
The plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the  Senate; Bob 
Hertzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City  of 
Oakland.? At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry  Brown, 
atty. Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty.  Clark 
Kelso, a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz  
Figueroa; and Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland.? 
?
The suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling  within 21 days.
?
Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not  fulfilling its 
statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.?  Hertzberg added 
that FERC had ignored the law and that they  were compelled to file suit for 
Californians' relief.
?
Joe Cotchett said the suit is ""very basic"" and is based on the  Federal Power 
Act, which he says limits power costs to ""fair and justifiable""  rates.??A 
primary?strategy in this suit is to present it as a  ""health and welfare"" and 
public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million  disabled children and 
12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely  affected by blackouts.? 
He said it is ""not an economic lawsuit -- it's  about senior citizens, 
disabled kids and convalescent facilities.""? Today  also happened to be the 
legislative day for the California Association of Health  Facilities (the 
nursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were  apparently 
asked to sit at the back of the room for effect.
?
Cotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were  opportunities 
to exert market power.? He also claimed that a Redondo Beach  facility 
(obviously AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant  off-line 
and substituting higher rates.? He said, however, that this order  had been 
sealed.
?
He cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of  blackouts this 
summer, which could mean four hours a day.? That could be,  he said, 
""potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in  refrigeration.""? Cotchett 
noted that only hospitals with more than 100 beds  are exempt from blackouts, 
which does not protect surgical centers or many  health facilities.
?
Jerry Brown added that ""prices are unjust and people are  suffering.""? 
Continued high prices could mean ""potential civic disruption,""  and that 
there will be ""more actions to mobilize"" Western mayors.
?
Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of  the lawsuit.
?
Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV  here as a 
legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy,  in 
his Press Club appearance.? He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the  
media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the  
suit.?Burton's lawyer's sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it  
to?join the legal team.
?
Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market  power for 
three years, and that the commission has delayed  action?unreasonably.? It 
has failed to define ""fair and justifiable"";  that failure, he said, violates 
the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of  the Constitution.
?
Kelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon  ""fellow 
Republicans"" to support the effort.
?
Joan Breuner (sp?), Oakland's vice mayor, said only that she  believed that 
if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than  California, the 
president and FERC would have acted long ago.
?
During the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing  is necessary 
because ""5 generators supply 90%"" of the electricity in CA and all  five have 
rate renewals before FERC.? He also said one of the cases that is  relevant 
is Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set  
standards (regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal  
Protection clause.? He also said six states have expressed interest in the  
case and have requested briefs:? Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington,  
Minnesota and one other he didn't name.? None of these states has yet  
committed to joining the suit.","John Burton Burton Phil Jim Steffes Scott Govenar Bob

2214,"Michael Albers, Head of unit for Energy in DG Competition gave a talk on 
competition priorities in Brussels yesterday.

Highlights:

Priorities for DG Comp are:  1) foster supply competition; for examlpe, new 
candidate for DG Comp's help has been identified in Belgium and it would be 
necesary to intervene to help this new competitor. In merger control, 
emphasis will be on supply solutions and not transmission market issues. 2) 
Crossborder Network Access: proceedings will be initiated after the summer 
re. French/Spanish and Dutch/Belgian borders. General policy will be spelt 
out in an Art. 19(3) notice on Viking Cable. [If we want to influence general 
policy we should make a submission on this before it appears: an Art 19(3) 
notice is a Commission Decision and constitutes a binding legal precedent. 
Although comments on Viking Cable can be made after the event, we would not 
be in a position to influence the policy published in the Notice. BD to 
follow up.] 3) Eligible customers should be able to choose their suppliers: 
most cases are resolved informally. 4) State Aid especially stranded costs; 
also environmental policy notice will have impact in this area (Nailia:please 
follow up.)

Specific cases:

On UK Gas Interconnector: no news.

Long term Agreements (gas and electricity): ""dominant firms cannot have 
exclusivity caluses, and long-term contracts as such may be a problem"".

SNAM/GAZPROM contracts: destination clauses are illegal, Commission to 
initiate proceedings after the Summer break; there will be no blue lining, 
meaning that in a contract where a clause is illegal, the Commission will 
press for the contract to be terminated, and not allow the contract to 
continue intact but the offending article 'blue lined' out. [This suggests we 
ought to offer some thoughts on draft model long term contracts.BD to follow 
up.]  Applicable mutatis mutandisto GFU contracts.

A gas case that will specify the limits of gas TPA regimes will be ""heard 
more of after the summer break"". (Access to Pipelines Case, TPA ex.-Emden, is 
my guess.)

Gas Release Programmes: no indication that this was an emerging issue: Albers 
offered no views.

Art 86(3) Directive -- cannot achieve what one can with an Art 95 Directive 
(I will write a separate explanation of this -- basically an Art 86(3) 
Directive cannot force regulatory structures on countries, i.e. a regulator, 
but can change a company's behaviour, i.e. account unbundling.)

There has not yet been any announcement for EBS. I welcome my new reporting 
to Sue Nord, but I would like to see some kind of official note on the new 
structure. I would like to know what my budget for Europe is and what the new 
procedures are for contracting outside counsels, or consultants.

As you may know, I have recently expressed interest with Anthony Duenner  for 
the vacant position with EBS Singapore. This mainly because there are more 
challenging regulatory issues at hand in the Asia/Pacific region and I have 
been able to familiarize myself with some of them, whereas in Europe this is 
not the case.

However, there are also some opportunities here, namely supporting Paul 
Hennemeyer on a part time basis. This mainly because my previous experience 
as competition lawyer might enable me to co-manage some of the court 
procedures currently pending. The recruitment for a German person with legal 
training only failed recently.

 I am basically open to pursue either opportunity, depending on what the 
company wants to me to do. My current job is for EBS Europe is not any longer 
a full time position, since I have secured all necessary licenses and our 
business is widely deregulated.

I copy Sue since I want this to be as transparent as possible & due to 
extensive travelling we have not been able to speak.","Rick Anthony Duenner   Paul

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

TEXAS GETS CAUGHT UP IN A POWER PLAY /Energy Alley to blame for California's woes? 

By ANN HODGES, Houston Chronicle TV Critic
Staff



Frontline joins hands with the New York Times tonight, to jump into what California Gov. Gray Davis has turned into a marathon news blast at Texas, and at Houston, over his state's energy woes. 

Frontline : Blackout, airing at 10 tonight, should have Davis and his bash-Texas troops giving each other high fives. 

In its opening minutes, Frontline 's narration sets a tone for Texas-bashing: 

""Investigators (otherwise unidentified) claim that a handful of energy companies siphoned billions from consumers while the lights (in California) were out. 

""If you want to understand the story of electric power in America today, you have to follow the electrons and follow the money. It's a story that starts here, in Houston, Texas."" 

The blame game is in high gear, as Frontline 's dust-up hovers over Houston. 

Houston's Energy Alley, home of ""electric cowboys"" (Frontline 's words), is the focus of this ""follow-the-money"" trail. 

And Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, ""the 800-pound gorilla"" in the Alley, gets the major grilling in its high-powered interview hot seat, along with Enron CEO Jeff Skilling. 

Interviewees also include Vice President Dick Cheney, California and federal officials, other company executives, industry insiders and what Frontline calls ""whistle-blowers."" 

Politics and finger-pointing fuel charges and countercharges, with Frontline correspondent and New York Times contributor Lowell Bergman conducting the interviews, and an off-camera narration spinning the sound and fury. 

With blackouts expected to hit New York this summer, ""the entire country will soon be short on power,"" Frontline asserts to set the stage. 

""The generators have made more money than God. I mean, they've made 7, 8, 900 percent profit,"" Davis charges. 

""Now that a fellow Texan sits in the White House,"" Frontline says, ""the companies on Energy Alley are hoping things will only get better. . . . Lay is a personal friend and big backer of President Bush, and he and his executives have been the Bush family's most generous contributors. . . . "" 

""There are a few of us that are still maybe idealistic enough to think that we can kind of support a candidate because we really believe in the individual,"" Lay counters. ""We believe in their policies. We believe in the direction they are going to take the country."" 

El Paso Corp., the largest natural gas company, gets its lumps, too, from California officials. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was ready to dismiss California's complaint of price manipulation at the state's borders, Frontline says, ""until Frontline and the New York Times obtained sealed documents revealing discussions at El Paso's highest levels."" 

""Those documents are irrelevant,"" El Paso spokeswoman Peggy Heeg says. 

Frontline passes its golden opportunity to lay out, clearly and concisely, both sides - what critics say are the self-inflicted origins of California's energy crisis, and California's charges of price-gouging and pleas for price caps. Instead, that information comes piecemeal, over the course of contentious and often-confusing exchanges. 

To avoid retreat on deregulation, now in progress in 24 states, companies have begun to raise the possibility of settlement with California, Frontline reports. In Lay's opinion, ""It's still going to take a comprehensive settlement of the whole issue, all the issues"" - including money. 

Give Frontline full credit for stepping in where no other TV news outlet has dared to tread in such depth. Something is surely better than nothing. 

But this Frontline /New York Times team coverage effort does not cool the blame game. It sheds more heat than light. 

Frontline : Blackout, 10 tonight, 9 p.m. June 12 on Channel 8. Grade: B.

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch Neg

Fitch-NY-October 26, 2001: Fitch has placed the ratings of
Marlin Water Trust II's (Marlin II's) approximately $915 million
senior secured notes due 2003, and Osprey Trust's (Osprey's)
approximately $2.4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on
Rating Watch Negative. The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes
are currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the
placing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by
Fitch.

The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund
account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron
in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The
overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated
'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service
interest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies
on Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible
preferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred
securities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the
transaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan
to Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.

Similarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the
support from the assets in the share trust used to support
interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to
remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund
principal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock
has been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assets
in the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron
unsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well as
quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible
preferred stock.

While various sources of repayment exist, such as sale or
liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, in
each case primary credit support is derived from the Enron
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock
if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been
deposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturity
date, which is one of the Note Trigger Events. In the event that
the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount
required to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to
deliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver
on this obligation, subject to certain standstill periods, then
the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of
Enron, representing a general unsecured claim. Additional Note
Trigger Events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured
debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies
in conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock
price over three consecutive trading days, as well as customary
events of default under the notes. It is important to note that
Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

Fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction
with the ratings of Enron, Corp. and will update investors as
appropriate.


Enron's Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans

10/26/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early Friday following the Houston energy giant's decision Thursday to draw down about $3 billion on its bank loan facilities. 
Late Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.
Enron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday. 
Trading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above distressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank debt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago. 
That was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday. 
Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, though it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & Poor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. 
Enron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 p.m. EDT. 
Among the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion 364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 billion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York. 
One distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. 
Banks, the investor said, ""are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02,"" the investor said. 
Another fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX) 
""As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books,"" this person said. 
Some banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that banks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven. 
""Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that,"" the fixed income official said.

As you know, the Commission has on its agenda for tomorrow a new proceeding entitled ""Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations"" (presumably being done under the Commission's section 206 authorization).  EPSA realizes that circulating its paper on market based rates probably does not make sense now that the Commission has noticed this proceeding, but they are prepare a press release for Lynn Church to release if, after seeing what the Commission has in mind, the investigation will apply to all holders of market based rates.  The press release will state that an investigation of the entire industry is overbroad, and (assuming the Commission makes all market based rates subject to refund during the investigation) that a refund obligation will introduce even more uncertainty into the industry than already exists.

I have a call in to EPSA to see if I can get any more details about what the press release will say.  Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for the press release.   I'll let everyone know what comes out of the FERC meeting as soon as I find out.

2252,"I would like to offer a different perspective on the attacks that occurred
last Tuesday. It's view of the forest that I don't think the press has not
gotten to in it's coverage so far.

The American reaction to this has been healthy and accurate. After reading
books on Normandy, Iwo Jima, I always wondered if the US still possessed a
fire in it's belly to stoke if someone should ever deliver a blow like
this. So far so good, but can it be sustained to go the distance? While the
media focuses on the personal tragedy and how to cope with what HAS happen,
maybe we should get in touch with our courage as well as our emotions to
deal with what MAY happen.

In my opinion is that the US has been provoked into a larger scheme.
Whoever did this not only expects the US to launch counter attacks, they
are betting on it. And they are betting that the US won't go it alone. They
are betting that  Western intervention in the Mid East will destabilize the
region, possibly the world, and that will ultimately bring the demise of
Israel. That is what these fanatics are ultimately after.

As you know, we've fought in the mid east before, but this time it will be
different in many ways. If the West opts for a militarily engagement (and I
would be shocked if they didn't) they will not have the coalition they did
for the Gulf War. Many of the Arab countries that were on board during
Desert Storm will not be able to internally support Western counter attacks
that will be frequent, massive and multinational.

Of course we should expect that these terrorist factions to volley their
own counter attacks back against the US. Retaliatory strikes from terrorist
may not be as spectacular as what happened last Tuesday, but they will be
just as ugly. They have many unspeakable options.

The terrorists that perpetrated the attacks on Tuesday, have calculated
that we, the American people, can not stomach a long, drawn out, ugly,
conflict. Sadam Hussein  made this assumption in the past and it was the
overwhelming support from  the American people that ultimately gave us the
strength to exact our mission and bring our troops home so soon (your truly
included).

But the Gulf War was neither long or drawn out. A campaign through the
mountains of Persia probably will be long, difficult and ugly. If you
recall this region was the labeled the Russian 'Vietnam'. I think the
perpetrators have already assumed that American, public support will
dissolve quickly for a conflict with TWO fronts. The main front in the
Southwest Asia AND A DOMESTIC front that will feature psychological and
physical violence that American has never had to deal with before. Really
think about that and ask yourself have they calculated correctly? I
personally think they have made a grave error. America may have a broken
nose, but it's arms, legs, and spirit stand ready and waiting.

I offer these opinions to get folks thinking and preparing for what might
happen next. And if it does, we have to examine our reaction and RESOLVE
now. The war that the President says that we are now in will surely last
longer than the hundred day Gulf War. I think it will probably take years
with uncomfortable lulls between attacks and skirmishes.

And a final point. I can definitely understand why Americans would want to
postpone regular activities out of respect for the Americans that lost
their lives. It's a natural, reactive response. What most people don't
understand however is that you do not let terrorist dictate what you do.
When that happens, you living your life by their rules. May I suggest a
proactive response. Return to normal life as closely as you can. That is
the best, immediate, defiant message we can send back to them. The first of
many...um...messages, we will be sending them.

tonight (Nov. 16) against Morehead State University. Read about how IPFW
hopes to build upon the spirit of this week's events in an article in the
Fort Wayne News-Sentinel.

IU'S NEW SUPERCOMPUTER IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S 50 MOST POWERFUL - IU's new
supercomputer, recently acquired through a partnership with IBM, is ranked
50th on the updated list of the world's 500 most powerful supercomputers.
The IU supercomputer, which can perform 1 trillion numerical calculations
per second and will serve as the backbone for planned research in genomics
and other disciplines, is the largest and fastest U.S. university-owned
computer in this ranking.

ATHLETICS:

MEN'S SOCCER TEAM TAKES NINTH BIG TEN CROWN - With a scoreless tie at the
end of the first half, Hoosier fans were a little worried about just how
many minutes of soccer were going to be played to determine a Big Ten
champion last Sunday (Nov. 11) in Madison. With 32:02 remaining in the
game, the Indiana men's soccer team put all fears to rest, scoring the
game-winner against Michigan State. The Hoosiers won their ninth
conference championship 2-0 over the Spartans. They now look ahead to the
NCAA tourney and seek a sixth national championship.

whether the delivery point is in as Mid-C or NW delivered. The only reason he 
entered NW delivered is because there was transmission involved. For your 
purposes, Sean said it's fine to change the delivery point to Mid-C (NW 
Delivered) in the confirms, but he didn't want to have it changed in EnPower 
because that would mess with the routing.

write for long just now because the ever-flourishing energy crisis is keeping 
us all very busy here at The Big Ron, as I so affectionately call it. Right 
now I'm on the cusp of either becoming a raging workaholic or cashing in my 
chips to become a professional beach bum. I know I already tried that and 
thought it wasn't for me, but trust me, one more month of this crap Portland 
weather and I'll ship myself right over to the Caribbean. And yes, I'm 
definitely coming to visit. It won't be for a couple months because this 
house move is going to set me back a bit. Let's just say I'm hoping I'll be 
so poor I'll be forced to lose weight in February. But I'm really excited - 
we move in on Friday - and the house is so cute. You have to at least come 
home to visit sometime so you can see it. I might even bring Kitty over, but 
Molly vehemently opposed the idea, and you know how Kitty doesn't like to be 
unsettled once she's staked her territory. (Big Kitty lives in daily fear.) 
Anyway, call me soon - you can call collect, or call and yelp into the phone 
and hang up - I'll know it's you and call back.

I'm stoked you're liking Denver - I really have to experience this ""Rocky 
Mountain High"" for myself. Please don't turn into a stoner ski bum and lose 
all fashion sense to the point of mistaking Patagonia and Tevas for catwalk 
wear. Hey, and you need to tell me more about this ""normal"" guy. You've got 
to watch out for those, you know - that's how the truly psycho ones disguise 
themselves. No, don't listen to me - I'll be bitter and single till I'm so 
old I have to get cats and live out my life like the crazy woman that I am. 
And this obsession with candles? You know you could head that off by setting 
up hundreds and hundreds of smoke alarms all over the house, or tell her that 
you just saw a special on 20/20 about houses burning down via over-decoration 
with candles. 

Hey - do you have a freaking job there? That's the only thing I haven't heard 
about. You must like it or you wouldn't have applied to stay, but I need 
DETAILS, I need DIRT. Call me soon, we'll dish.

is the same one we dealt with a month ago. I spoke with Tracy Green, one of 
our contacts at Avista, and she had been dealing with the same issue all day. 
Apparently, when Avista first incorrectly reported that we hadn't made a 
payment, it set off a domino effect of doubts that seems to still be falling. 
So NYMEX called EDF Mann, our futures clearing broker, today to assure that 
payment would be made today.

Tracy had been speaking with her broker at ABN-AMRO; I had been speaking with 
ours at Mann; and NYMEX had been communicating through both of these entities 
to us. I've left a message with John Croddock at NYMEX to discuss this 
directly with him. His number, if you'd like it for your own purposes, is 
(212) 299-2146.

Other contacts are Tracy Green, Avista, at (509) 495-8535, and Gary (?), ABN, 
at (212) 859-1212.

As far as Avista, ABN, ED&F Mann, and EPMI are considered, the March Palo

2316,"I found this on a sailing magazine web page:

An acquaintance who is a professor of literature at Stanford brought Patrick 
O'Brian to my attention, claiming him to be the finest living author writing 
in the English language. Being an avid reader who had consumed about 
everything including, of course, all of Forster's Hornblower books, I had my 
doubts. But after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen 
O'Brian Aubrey/Maturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation 
and awe, I wholeheartedly concurred. After a second reading of the entire 
series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories I felt 
compelled to pay down the debt I owed this author for the wonderful, 
life-enriching experience he had given me. Since O'Brian obviously loved the 
sea, it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnight's cruse aboard my 
Perini ketch, the 154 foot Andromeda la Dea, for himself and his friends 
without any interfering presence from myself. 

I asked Danielle Steel if she thought O'Brian would be offended by receiving 
such a letter and her interesting reply was, ""I get about 20,000 letters per 
year from readers and I have yet to receive a single one offering to do 
anything for me - he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent 
him from accepting."" So I wrote via his publisher, having literally no idea 
where in the world he lived, and after some forwarding delay I received his 
handwritten reply, in his fine and precise penmanship, saying ""I accept your 
kind offer with perhaps obscene haste.""
As Mr. O'Brian was to give a lecture tour of the United States in early 1995 
that included San Francisco, I invited him to dinner the week of his visit 
and I first saw him in person when I attended his lecture in Herbst Hall. His 
host was the poet laureate of America (Robert Haas). I was both charmed and 
alarmed when introduced to O'Brian's lightening quick wit and rather acerbic 
manner. 

The following evening he and his wife, Mary, came to my house in Belvedere 
for a 'literary' dinner with admirers and one or two other authors. Mr. 
O'Brian was utterly charming, if perhaps a little aloof. He took tremendous 
interest in an Admiralty Board (dockyard) model I have of an English First 
Rater of 1702. He understood everything about that ship and greatly augmented 
my own knowledge. After the other guests departed, we settled into a series 
of brandies by the fire and I discovered: 1) his capacity for serious 
drinking greatly exceeded my own; 2) his reserve only eased very slightly in 
the presence of this unknown American (me) and; 3) his knowledge of the 
practical aspects of sailing seemed, amazingly, almost nil.

After a half liter of cognac had vanished (and we were still calling each 
other Mr. O'Brian and Mr. Perkins), I produced a chart of the Mediterranean 
and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise. 

I had learned that the O'Brians' home was in Collioure, a village on the 
Mediterranean coast of France just north of the Spanish border, in Basque 
country. The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby, where Andromeda could pick 
all of them up. O'Brian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating Sicily, a 
stop in Greece, dropping by Beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour 
of the Balearic islands. I was stunned! How, I wondered, could this old salt 
possibly comprehend a tour of over 3,000 nautical miles with numerous port 
calls, in only 14 days in a yacht capable of only about 12 knots? 

As I began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a 
desire to drop the hook in Naples, Capri and Tangiers as well. While I could 
not reconcile this plan with reality, I assumed it was the wine in control 
and then I was both startled and pleased when he added at the evening's end 
that he had a major non-negotiable condition to accepting my offer; namely 
that I personally would join him, Mary and their guests aboard my yacht. 
?
In May 1995, as the departure date appoached, I had a rough time getting 
Andromeda to the tiny and picturesque Port Vendres in time to pick them up. 
Every time I have been in the Gulf of Lions, I have been pasted and this was 
one of the worst. Andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all 
telecommunication as well, but after a real dusting we made it and O'Brian 
and Mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest and 
charming home. He took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes, 
pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar. I was fascinated by his 
office, where the books were written. It was lined floor to ceiling with 
reference works on an array of subjects (botany, geography, zoology, 
medicine, etc.) in several languages, but not a single volume dated later 
than 1820. He was literally immersed in the period of his work. 

The following morning we were joined by his close friend, the scholar (and 
foremost authority on Peeps) Richard Ollard, his publisher Stuart Proffit and 
his agent Vivien Green. We finalized our itinerary with the decision to visit 
all the Balearic islands and O'Brian, somewhat wistfully, asked if an 
additional stop in Istanbul would not be possible? Told it was not, he 
boarded radiating the impression that I was something of an Indian giver, 
short-changing him on his yachting holiday.

Underway to Menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind, 
the sailing was marvelous and O'Brian was delighted. I introduced him to the 
helm, but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course, and 
frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe. I began to 
suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth 
were fanciful. He had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like 
Andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a 
day. However, he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of 
seasickness. Mary, quiet, kind, interesting and interested, was wonderful to 
have aboard. However, she was very frail. They were both nearly 80 and I 
constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ship's motion, but 
thankfully this never occurred. 

Before dinner O'Brian asked me if I was familiar with an American drink 
called the martini and he tested my composition of two such killers with 
relish. All the conversations at the table were spirited and he was the 
center of the talk and controlled its direction totally. I found the level of 
sophistication and erudition of these people to be greater than any I had 
ever experienced, and when they turned to literary or historical contexts I 
was left far behind. My MIT engineer's degree had, alas, not prepared me for 
cultivated discourse at such a level. It was literally exhausting, but a 
marvel to follow. 

The weather continued to be fine and the next morning we were off Menorca. 
O'Brian suggested that we sail (sail, not motor) into the long narrow channel 
leading to the port of Mahon, the location of the first meeting between 
Aubrey and Maturin. This was pretty tricky for a boat of Andromeda's size, 
but I carried it off, happily, without mishap. We had an interesting 
afternoon ashore with O'Brian showing us about the old city with intense 
enthusiasm while also demonstrating his fluency in Catalan, the local tongue. 
That evening, while at dinner back aboard the yacht, he suggested for the 
first time that I call him Patrick and he would use Tom for me.

And so our cruise continued, with Patrick showing keen interest in 
everything; we fished with some success; we sailed every day; we visited the 
port of Ciudadela on Menorca and we sailed past the majestic Cape Formentor 
on the northeast tip of Mallorca where Patrick was entranced by the thousands 
of sea birds. Ornithology was his true passion as it was for his character 
Stephen Maturin, who is clearly modeled on Patrick's physique and personality.
?
One evening there was an extremely heated discussion around the table which 
led to hurt feelings requiring overnight to heal. It started with Patrick 
asking me if I had heard of a place, Indiana, and a school, the University of 
Indiana and did I think the school financially responsible? The University's 
English department had purchased (and not yet paid for) two or three of 
Patrick's manuscripts and had a professor offering a course on O'Brian which 
Patrick found intensely offensive. Patrick then mentioned that he was 
destroying all of his diaries, his journals and all of his correspondence so 
that no trace of his existence would remain save his novels. 

Richard Ollard was aghast, and Ms. Green was very upset with this quite 
startling revelation. Ollard said that it was a crime against the future and 
reminded Patrick that he himself had relied heavily on Pablo Picasso's 
letters when he had written a well-received biography of the artist. 

Patrick heatedly countered that Picasso had trusted him, but that he, 
Patrick, could not rely upon the goodwill of ""some post-doctoral American 
fool."" So the tension-filled discussion continued. The analogy of an artist 
framing his painting was raised; it was then complete and should not require 
either the support nor deserve the distraction of knowing the artist's frame 
of mind at the time of creation. 

Now, after Patrick's death, we understand some of his thinking. He was his 
own construct, born Patrick Russ, English not Irish, not university educated, 
not a sailor, a father who abandoned his family, and altogether a piece of 
his own fiction. But, that night aboard Andromeda, only Mary knew the truth 
and understood his deep motives.

The following day the unpleasantness passed with more superb sailing in fine 
Mediterranean weather. While under full sail with the huge MPS drawing in 
light wind, with our centerboard keel raised and guided by - as it turned out 
- an inaccurate Spanish chart, we decided to sail between the coast and a 
small island, and we ran firmly aground in shallow water. In the Med one 
can't simply wait for a higher tide, so we emptied all our fresh water tanks 
and tried to back off. No luck. I blew out the water in our centerboard trunk 
with compressed air, over ten tons. Still no luck. Finally, we tied a long 
hawser to a rock astern and, using our anchor windlass to bar-tight tension, 
we slowly worked our way off waggling to and fro with our bow thruster. 
Patrick was delighted with all these nautical operations. He nearly believed, 
I thought, that we had arranged the event for his entertainment. 

One morning at breakfast, after our friendship had become more firmly 
established, Patrick said, ""Tom, I wish to ask you an embarrassing question 
which will reveal my utter and total ignorance of all things in this modern 
world. What is software?"" My answer, ""The piano is the hardware and the sheet 
music is the software,"" satisfied him and upon reflection, myself as well.

Every afternoon between two and five, Patrick retired to my on-board office 
to work on his novel The Yellow Admiral, then in progress. He borrowed the 
yacht's charts of France, particularly the area around Brest, to incorporate 
detail of the blockade of Brest which is featured in that book. Very much to 
Mary's surprise he showed me each day's progress. She said that he had never 
shared his work with anyone before completion. Later, Patrick sent me the 
original manuscript for this volume which I still keep aboard and which I 
treasure.

Thus we cruised for ten days arriving in Palma where the demands of business 
required that all of Patrick's guests and I depart. He and Mary continued on 
to Ibiza with the yacht's crew for three further days, mostly to study that 
island's renowned bird colonies. Then they sailed, uneventfully, back to Port 
Vendres.

My friendship with Patrick continued until his death in January of this year. 
We corresponded. He and Mary stayed in my home. They were aboard my schooner 
Mariette. We met at his club, Brooks, in London. He was a genius and his 
books remain a towering, towering achievement. I miss him greatly.

2323,"Dianne, further to our conversation this morning, this e-mail will confirm 
the following:

1.  The current form of Master Physical Gas Agreement with Duke is an older 
master which indicates that transactions must be confirmed in writing and 
arguably provides that such confirms are not binding until executed by both 
parties.  However, the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement indicates 
that, where a confirm is issued, it is deemed accepted unless objected to 
within three business days.  There is no indication in the EOL Electronic 
Trading Agreement how a conflict between the provisions of that agreement and 
any master agreement will be resolved, but I think that for the purposes of 
the EnronOnline transactions, we can rely on the terms of the Electronic 
Trading Agreement and, if Duke has not objected to the terms set forth in the 
EOL confirm within three business days, determine that such confirms are 
valid and binding upon the counterparty.

2.  However, with respect to any physical gas transactions entered into with 
Duke under the Master but not through EnronOnline, we still need them to 
execute and return the confirm.

3.  Regarding financial deals entered into through EnronOnline and made 
pursuant to the electronic form of GTC, the terms of the Electronic Trading 
Agreement will govern and, unless Duke objects to the terms of the confirm 
within three business days, the confirm is deemed to be valid and binding on 
Duke.

4.  Notwithstanding the above, I think we should still try to maintain our 
practice with other counterparties of obtaining executed confirms back from 
such counterparties.

Mark, if you have any concerns with these conclusions, can you please let me 
know at your earliest convenience.  Duke currently has approximately 350 
outstanding confirms entered into with ECC through the facilities of 
EnronOnline that they have not executed and returned and they have told us 
that they are relying on the Electronic Trading Agreement as providing there 
is no requirement to execute and return these confirms.

Although Milbank has stated that ""EOLympics"" is probably permissible use, 
both Japanese and UK counsel have taken the position that this is still 
impermissible use of the term ""Olympics"".  

I know its not your first choice, Dave, but especially if we are going to 
promote the game on the home page -- which can be searched by any Olympic 
committee checking the Web for infringing use -- it would help to insulate us

Statoil's clean ships could offset NOx emissions 

UK: August 8, 2001 

LONDON - Norwegian energy firm Statoil said on Tuesday savings in acid-rain-causing nitrogen oxide (NOx) from two new low-emitting ships would allow it to meet its NOx emissions reduction targets from one new power station. 

""We've been given permission to credit these NOx reductions against land-based projects,"" Knut Barland, vice-president for environment at Statoil told Reuters. 
""And the kind of reduction we'd be getting on these ships would meet the NOx emission reduction target for one of these (planned) power plants."" 
The North Sea supply ships are small compared to cargo ships, but are so powerful they can be used to drag around oil rigs. 
They are usually so thirsty for diesel that they pump out as much NOx pollution each day as several thousand cars. 
But by designing each of them to run on Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), gas that has been super-cooled until it condenses as liquid, NOx emissions from the two ships can be cut by 85 percent or 420 tonnes a year. 
""That means one ship is equivalent to half the (NOx) emissions from a gas-fired power station,"" said Aksel Skjervheim of Naturgass Vest, which will provide the ships with their super-cooled fuel. 
UNIQUE GOVERNMENT APPROVAL 
Statoil's Barland said that the government had given it a unique permission to credit the NOx reduction against land-based emissions, which could be from any one of five projects including two controversial 400 megawatt gas-fired power stations Statoil is involved in. 
He said the power plants, one at Kaarstoe and one at Kollsnes near Bergen, were planned by a joint venture between Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Statkraft. 
They are not controversial because of their NOx emissions, but because of their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. 
""We've been granted permission for the CO2 as long as we comply with Kyoto, but keeping the NOx down to the five parts per million (ppm) limit (specified by the government) could be very expensive,"" said Barland. 
Norway imposes a five ppm limit on NOx emissions in some regions aimed at curbing acid rain. 
""Constructing a NOx treatment plant would be a very expensive and very old-fashioned way, and therefore we've been given the opportunity of finding a third party solution,"" he said. 
The shipping NOx offset deal works out comparatively cheaply. 
The two hi-specification ships will cost Statoil an extra nine million Norwegian crowns per year to run, compared to conventional diesel-powered ships. 
But when converted into NOx credits, they would allow Statoil to cut emmissions at a cost of 22 crowns per kilogram (kg), compared to 30-40 crowns per kg by building NOx treatment into a new power plant. 
While this approach to emissions might help overcome the NOx hurdle for the Kaarstoe and Kollsnes plants, the project might yet stumble on CO2 limits. 
""We could buy CO2 emissions permits, but there's still a lot of political uncertainty over the cost and that is something we're having to consider very carefully,"" said Barland. 
He said much would depend on Kyoto's final mechanism for CO2 emmissions trading and the extent to which Norway adopted the measures. 
Barland said he hoped the cost of future LNG-powered ships would fall as more LNG filling-stations were built around Norway's coast, and shipyards gained the right expertise. 
To date only one LNG-powered ship has been built, a Norwegian fjord ferry, which runs on fuel from Norway's only LNG filling station, the Aga-owned 15,000 tonne per year (tpy) mini-LNG plant at Tjeldbergodden. 
Naturgass Vest, in which Statoil is a partner, hopes to build Norway's second mini-LNG plant of 30-40,000 tpy at Kollsnes and later on another near Stavanger. 
""That will make LNG-powered coastal shipping possible in Norway,"" said Barland. ""Next time we issue a contract, we hope LNG will be competitive in its own right.""

2348," Monmouth College has received a grant of $131,216 from the federal
Recreational Trails Program (RTP), Gov. George H. Ryan announced Friday.
 ""Securing the grant funds for the trail project was a real team
effort by faculty, administration, staff and federal and state legislative
friends of Monmouth College,"" said college president Richard F. Giese, who
gave special thanks to Ken Cramer, biology department chair; Pete Loomis,
physical plant director; Susan Dagit, director of advancement for corporate
and foundation gifts; and Dick Valentine, vice president for external
relations.
 ""They were instrumental in developing and promoting this exciting
project that will benefit both our students and the community of Monmouth,""
added Giese. ""We also are grateful for the strong bipartisan support we
received from our federal representative, Lane Evans (D), our state
representative, Don Moffitt (R) and our state senator, Carl Hawkinson (R).""
 The funds will be used to develop an 8-foot wide, 1.25-mile loop
trail at the college's LeSuer Nature Preserve on the northeast edge of town.
Funding for the grant comes from the RTP and is administered by the Illinois
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) in cooperation with the Illinois
Department of Transportation. The college was one of 14 grant recipients
statewide.
 ""We needed this grant to really do things the way we wanted to do
them,"" said Dagit.
 David Sellman, the senior grant administrator with the IDNR, said
that Monmouth's application received high marks.
 ""The college did well in meeting our criteria,"" he said, referring
to the fact that the money would be used to create a new trail and that
support amenities such as public restrooms were available. ""We were also
impressed with the maintenance capabilities of the college.""
 The proposal says ""the trail will (have) a surface of creek gravel.
Two bridges - a low-water bridge large enough to support trail maintenance
equipment and a 50-foot footbridge that will not impact water flow - will be
built across Markham Creek. The trail will provide access to hiking and
areas of ecological restoration."" The trail will loop around the college's
nature preserve as well as Peacock Memorial Athletic Park.
 ""From its conception, the LeSuer Nature Preserve was designed with a
goal of serving the public as an educational and recreational area, as well
as to preserve and restore habitat for native species,"" said Cramer. ""While
restoration of native plants has been ongoing, this grant provides us with a
great opportunity to increase public access and use of the area. We want
people to be able to see and enjoy the streams, woods and tall-grass prairie
on this preserve and the trail and bridges built with this grant money will
enable folks to do just that.""

issues about setting up the shell corporation, what are the rules for the

Wednesday.   Based on our conversation a few weeks ago I thought you might 
want the following information on the requirements for a foreign attorney to 
be licensed in Texas.  (I have not mentioned anything to Andrea regarding 
this issue.)  The requirements for a Texas license are set forth in the Texas 
Board of Law Examiners Rule XIII B.

The requirements include:

1.  Having been licensed, for at least five of the last seven years, to 
practice law in the highest court of the foreign nation.
2.  Hold the equivalent of a J.D. degree (Texas requires that the applicant 
must use an approved credential evaluation service to evaluate the applicants 
legal education.)
3.  Meet one of the following:
 A.  Demonstrate that the law of such foreign nation is sufficiently 
comparable to the law of Texas that, in the judgment of the board, it enables 
the foreign attorney to become a competent attorney in Texas without 
additional formal education, or
 B.  hold an L.L.M. from an approved Law School.


The University of Houston offers a general comparative L.L.M. program that is 
open to foreign students.  The program take anywhere from one year to three 
years depending on whether the student is going full time or part time.  
Applicants must present evidence of a high grade point average or class 
standing at the undergraduate law level.

Enron offers educational assistance and will reimburse employees for up to 
90% of the costs of courses and 75% of the costs of required books for 
work-related courses of study.  Reimbursements are made upon successful 
completion of approved courses.

Further to my voice mail to you, Mark,   an outfit called Energy Crossroads 
has a website through which, among other things, they auction power 
transmission in California, including some that our traders want to consider 
bidding on for a deal with the City of Anaheim.  If we were to bid and get 
the transmission, we would enter into a WSPP open access tariff transmission 
agreement directly between EPMI and Anaheim.   To bid through this online 
system we must click on a button that says we agree to:

1. indemnify them from claims arising out of our use of the site,  any 
transactions we conduct through or not through the site with members of the 
site, and our violation of the agreement or any infringement. 

2. agree to accept personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal 
courts of Orange County, California.

guide for Louise/myself/PR in the event we take a media call regarding the 
injunction/lawsuit. Also, if you have any ideas to expand the list, please

Q1 Did Agency.com develop EnronOnline?
A Agency.com was hired to provide development support for some elements of 
EnronOnline. Other elements were designed and built by Enron staff.

Q2 Which elements did Agency.com develop?
A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements 
which Agency was involved in developing.

Q3 What parts of the system did Enron develop?
A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements 
which Enron developed.

Q4 Why have you filed an injunction against Agency?
A We believe that Agency has been releasing confidential information without 
authorisation from Enron.

Q5 What is the amount of your lawsuit?
A We are not releasing that information at this time.

Q6 Do you believe that the release of this information by Agency has damaged 
the competitive lead of EnronOnline?
A We believe that Agency has released information in contravention of the 
terms of their contract with us. Whether or not this release of information 
is damaging to EnronOnline is a matter which has yet to be determined.

Q7 Does this experience make you want to avoid working with outside agencies?
A We believe that outside agencies are a valuable source of expertise which 
can complement the Enron's strong IT skillset. We don't believe that the 
actions of one company in any way tarnishes the ability of other, very 
capable IT consultancy companies.

Q8 Are you happy with the product which Agency.com provided?
A We are very pleased with the final product represented by EnronOnline, but 
are not in a position to comment on the strength of any of the individual 
contributors.

Q9 Prior to this lawsuit, would you have recommended Agency.com to other 
companies looking to build something like EnronOnline?
A No. We would not have recommended for or against the use of Agency.com.

Q10 You must be quite angry that a consultant has splashed your information 
into a public forum.
A We are disappointed that the confidentiality between ourselves and our 
contractor does not seem to have been upheld.

Q11 What do you hope to gain from this lawsuit/injunction?
A We hope to prevent the further release of confidential information.

Q12  If all you want to do is prevent the release of information, why are you 
also filing a lawsuit?
A The lawsuit is required at this time to enable the injunction. If it is 
found that damages have been caused as a result of the information which has 
already been released, then compensation may also be appropriate.

2368,"Mark and Jeff,

The Paper & Pulp desk has a customer that they would like to put into a three 
year financial deal; however, the credit profile of the customer would 
require hefty upfront security.  At the same time, they would like to enter 
into a contract wherein ENA purchases all of their production (newsprint) at 
index prices.  ENA's payable to this company could run to 10MM/ month.  Can 
we draft a netting arrangement that would allow us to net the physical and 
financial exposures in the event of a default so that the customer would not 
be required to post security for the financial deal?  I think we may have 
done something along these lines for a couple of Fred Lagrasta's customers.  
I am comfortable that the purchase payable will more than offset the 
potential financial exposure, but want to ensure that you are comfortable 
that the ability to net these two exposures can be assured through a 
contract.  Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,

2369,"Hi Guys

The following matters were discussed with Gay Wisbey, Paul Richardson and Ted 
Morris of the Markets & Exchanges Division of the FSA.

FSA's view is that as more and more trading activity is moving from 
traditional exchanges to proprietary electronic platforms the distinction 
between the two is becoming blurred.  Currently, FSA has regulatory oversight 
over both exchanges and firms which conduct regulated activity via their own 
electronic platforms but the regulatory regime applicable to each differs.  
In the light of this FSA is considering implementation of a dedicated 
regulatory regime for alternative trading platforms (ATSs) so that regardless 
of whether business is conducted via an exchange or an electronic platform, 
FSA would be able to monitor price transparency, transaction transparency, 
market depth and robustness of systems supporting the platform.  As far as 
the current situation is concerned FSA mentioned that even before 
implementation of a specific ATS regime they would like electronic platform 
operators such as Enron to keep FSA informed of any squeezes in the market 
which become apparent to our traders - this seemed to be related to 
EnronOnline activity vs offline activity.  This is clearly not something we 
do now for offline deals.

Regulation of the EnronOnline platform could result in:

a) monitoring of the platform and activity on it particularly in terms of 
operational robustness with no additional regulation of products quoted on   
EnronOnline;
b) regulation of the trading of financial products (currently regulated 
through EEFT arranging deals for ECTRIC) and physical products (currently   
unregulated).  This could result in an anomolous situation where Enron's 
offline physical trading is unregulated while online physical trading is   
regulated.
c) increased concern as to the systemic risk which increased trading activity 
via EnronOnline poses and therefore greater attention being paid to the   
management of counterparty credit risk and capitalisation.

I suggest that we issue a guest user id to the FSA to enable them to monitor 
prices on an ongoing basis.

FSA is releasing a discussion document re ATSs in late May.  Jonathan Marsh 
is monitoring developments in this area and will liaise with Justin Boyd and 
me as soon as the paper is published.  This should provide further insight 
into their intentions.

Please let me know if you need any further information at this stage.

Based on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just

would mean a flow control value of 0.26 or a discount factor of 0.63

calculated right now because they will depend on how many

2386,"With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen=
=20
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about th=
e=20
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron=01,s success is the increasing qualit=
y and=20
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very be=
st=20
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the=
=20
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

? Hire the best people.
? Provide challenging opportunities.
? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not=
=20
entitlement).
? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The=
=20
PRC is built on this foundation:

? 360 degree performance feedback.
? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions an=
d=20
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understa=
nd=20
the following details:

? Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excel=
lent=018,=20
=01&strong=018, ""satisfactory"", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=
=018 to group all=20
employees.  This year, =01&relative to his/her peers=018 precedes each of t=
hese=20
descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to=
=20
do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers=
. =20
It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher lev=
el=20
compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current perio=
d=20
if other employees=01, performance raised the bar.
? Teamwork.  A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee t=
o=20
gain, others must suffer.  However, feedback is explicitly solicited on=20
teamwork when evaluating each individual=01,s performance.  Anyone who atte=
mpts=20
to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others i=
n=20
the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance=
=20
criterion.
? Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has=
=20
been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistentl=
y=20
captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made=
=20
the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee=
=20
talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30%=20
strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC=
=20
committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at=
=20
Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is=
=20
some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face=
=20
this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance =
or=20
are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations=
=20
adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informe=
d=20
discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflec=
ts=20
their groups=01, overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
? Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated =01&satisfactory=018 or below shoul=
d know=20
his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to=20
communicate ratings of =01&strong=018 and above.  In all cases, employees w=
ill=20
receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of=20
success, and areas that need improvement.

We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process.  We woul=

as his arrogance and illogic is very frustrating, but our discussion was very

substance.  This apprarently means we have not offered them energy at below 
market prices.  I indicated that should he find some of that energy in the 
""$50 - $60"" range to give me a call as we would be willing to buy in the ""70s

adder?  High end of the range?  Mid point?  What would the demand charge be 
for mid-point of the range?  We would also compensate the desk to receive a 
demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral.  The desk should 
love that much of the structure.  Try to get some numbers from Janie.

 I have had numerous conversations with Citizens and TW.  TW will do the deal 
but want their liability limited to $140,000 year.  Citizens wants this 
liability increased to $1,000,000.  We could do this by buying insurance.  We 
might subcontract with TW to do this so the services deals is between ENA and
