In our meeting on the 17th of November, the NetWorks team explained their 
position(s) relative to possible upcoming purchases of software, in which BMC 
might be selected as the vendor.  There were several issues and concerns 
which were voiced, mostly related to BMC's lack of support and suboptimal 
application capability (that is the ""net"", understated version).

Bob, you and I spoke briefly after the meeting regarding what, if anything, 
BMC could do to ""fix their problem"".  I relayed the gist of our brief 
conversation to EBS.

As discussed in the meeting, EBS has a near-term opportunity to get a deal 
done with BMC, and it would be of optimum benefit to execute this year.  One 
of the outcomes of our November 17 meeting is that EBS has been pressing BMC 
for a BMC commitment to Enron's overall customer satisfaction.  Per a 
voicemail to me from EBS, it appears that BMC have provided a response to EBS.

I would like to schedule a meeting for the addressees of this note for either 
November 30th, or December 1st.  The purpose is to get an update from the 
NetWorks team on the BMC application testing that was underway, and for EBS 
to explain what BMC has proposed.  This meeting should take an hour.  

Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow or Friday.  I'll book a room and 
time that works for the majority, and confirm with a Notes ""Meeting 
Invitation"".

Thank you,

Jeff

Just a followup to our phone call earlier this morning.   Have begun to see short-term intraday topping patterns.   Natural has reached its mid-range of price objectives.  See no rationale  for holding significant length here.  Winter months seem especially high  and most vulnerable to correction.  The first hour's negative close  produced a sell signal against today's high.  Still too early to ascertain  if this is the end of entire up move.  Have targets into early next week,  but mkt. has reached where it needed to.",,,mkt

91,"Hi Folks,
?
Careening toward the week 11 games as we try to  keep you on top of all the 
latest happenings.
?
Before we jump to this week's Updated Players in  the News, I wanted to let 
you know we've updated the Target  numbers.? Understanding how many times a 
player has been thrown to  (targeted) can offer a much better picture of how 
an offense is truly  distrubiting the workload.? You can find the WR targets 
here http://www.cheatsheets.net/wrtargets.htm?and  the TE numbers here 
http://www.cheatsheets.net/tetargets.htm??  Enjoy.

News galore....let's jump into  it


Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Chris Chandler (Atl)  is doubtful with a concussion. He has not practiced 
all week. QB Danny  Kanell will start in his place.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is  expected to sit another week with a sore shoulder. 
Doug Flutie gets the start  again.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) still cannot throw and will  not play this week. Jim 
Miller starts in his absence.

QB Doug  Pederson (Cle) will start this week, but the coaches may give him 
the  quick hook should he struggle.

QB Troy Aikman (Dal)  practiced with the first team Thursday and is expected 
to start this  week. If he cannot go because of his back, Cliff Stoerner 
would start. Randall  Cunningham is also hurt with a sore knee and has not 
practiced.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Coach Dave Campo says he'll wait 
until Sunday to declare a  starter for this week's game.? We expect it to be 
Aikman, but given this  uncertainty, I'd look elsewhere for a QB.
?
QB Brian Griese (Den) continues to  play through his ailments. This week will 
be no different.

QB  Charlie Batch (Det) has recovered from his concussion and is expected  to 
start this week.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) is  expected to play with a sore elbow. Hint to team, 
Maybe try throwing for less  than 500 yards?

QB Daunte Culpepper (Min) does not  appear on the injury report, but has a 
sore knee. He is expected to start this  week.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) was seen wearing a splint and  did not practice on 
Wednesday. The team is being very mum whether he will play  or not. John 
Friesz would get the start in his absence, but the team could also  use 
Michael Bishop if Friesz struggles. This is likely a situation you should  
avoid if at all possible.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE)  continues to draw conflicting 
information. Some say he's looking a  little more likely to start Sunday.? 
Others say the team is sandbagging and  he'll miss a couple of weeks.? Even 
if he does start, you'd have to think  thumb would be a problem.? I'd look 
elsewhere if you can.

QB  Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) still has a stiff neck, but has played through  it 
the last two weeks. Expect the same this week.

QB Kordell  Stewart (Pit) gets the start this week.

QB Jim Harbaugh  (SD) is listed as questionable, but he will not start. The 
team named  Moses Moreno the starter earlier in the week.

QB Brock Huard  (Sea) is not fully over his concussion. He is expected to sit 
this  week. Jon Kitna will get the start.

QB Kurt Warner (StL)  is out for another 2-3 weeks.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Kurt Warner  (StL)? St. Louis Post Dispatch is 
reporting Warner will have the  pins removed from his finger Tuesday.? 
Remember early on that Warner said  he'd return one day after the pins were 
removed.? Most feel that's way too  optimistic but expect to hear a lot about 
this soon.

QB Shaun  King (TB) has tonsilitis, but is expected to play on Sunday. He  
practiced on Thursday. 

QB Steve McNair (Ten) will  likely be added today to the injury report with a 
sore back. He expects to play  on Sunday though.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is on a bye this  week and will not play.

QB Jeff George (Was) is on a bye  this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Running Backs  in the News:

RB Bob Christian (Atl) is questionable with a sore  knee. He did not practice 
on Thursday.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo  (Bal) is listed as questionable with a sore toe.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Obafemi  Ayanbadejo (Bal) will likely play although 
Sam Gash will be the  starter.? Keep an eye on Ayandbadejo as he quietly had 
some very productive  weeks early in the season.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf)  returned to practice and will play this week.

RB  Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) rested Wednesday, but is expected to play  
with his sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Tshimanga  Biakabutuka's (Car) outlook has dimmed?a 
little as he was  downgraded to Questionable.? He wasn't able to practice any 
this week and  looks to be a gametime decision now.? If he can't go, Brad 
Hoover will  start at Tailback.? Yes, that would be the undrafted Fullback 
Brad  Hoover...

RB Brandon Bennett (Cin) is healthy enough to  play this weekend. He will 
backup Corey Dillon.

RB Jamel White  (Cle) is expected to cut into Travis Prentice's carries this  
week.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) is expected to play with a  sore ankle.

RB Howard Griffith (Den) was able to  practice and will play this week.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB)  is likely out for the rest of the year. Ahman Green 
will start in his  absence.

RB Shyrone Stith (Jac) missed Wednesday's  practice, but heexpects to play if 
needed.

RB Ricky Williams (NO)  is expected to play with his sore shoulder.

RB Joe  Montgomery (NYG) is listed as questionable and did not practice  
Wednesday. With Thunder and lightning healthy, he will likely be rested to 
get  healthier.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) is fine, but the Jets  continue to list 100 players on 
the injury report. He will start on  Sunday.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) has two sprained ankles  and was held out of 
practice on Wednesday. He played through the pain last week,  but looks as if 
he is in worse shape this week. He will likely be a game-time  decision which 
is ugly since he plays on Monday Night. We will keep you posted  regarding 
any breaking news regarding his status.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Tyrone  Wheatley (Oak) was unable to practice 
Saturday according to ESPN's John  Clayton.? He could still play Monday as 
he's clearly shown he can play  through pain.? I'm very leery though.? If I 
had another comprable  back, I'd go there this week.

RB Amp Lee (Phi) is  expected to play with a sore back.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala  (Pit) is out for the next three weeks.

RB Jerome Bettis  (Pit) skipped Wednesday's practice, but isexpected to start 
on  Sunday.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) skipped Wednesday's  practice, but ishopeful of 
playing on Sunday.

practiced.

RB Marshall Faulk (StL) is out for another 3  weeks.

*** Saturday Update? RB Trung Canidate  (StL) is rumored to be making his 
first appearance this week.?  I'll be interested to see how he affects 
Watson's playing time.

RB Robert Holcombe (StL) has a  sore hamstring, but expects to play. He is 
listed as questionable on the injury  report.

RB Eddie George (Ten) is banged up with a sore  knee and toe. But look for 
the iron-man to suit and play on Sunday.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Eddie George (Ten)  went through the Saturday walk 
through today and looks to start.?  

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will use the bye week to heal  his sprained wrist.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is on a bye  this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Wide  Receivers in the News:

WR David Boston (Ari) has a sore  hamstring, but is expected to play. 

WR Tim Dwight (Atl)  will be downgraded to questionable on Friday's injury 
report. He has  sore ribs and could be a game-time decision.

WR Travis Taylor  (Bal) was placed on injured reserve and is lost for the  
year.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Patrick  Johnson (Bal) gets another start with Taylor 
gone.?  

WR Kevin Drake was signed by Buffalo.

WR  Muhsin Muhammad (Car) is expected to play with his sore  hamstring.

WR David Patten (Cle) has not practiced and  is doubtful this week.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle)  practiced on Wednesday despite being listed as 
questionable with a sore  knee.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Darrin Chiaverini  (Cle) will miss Sunday's game.

WR Raghib Ismail (Dal)  has a torn ACL and is lost for the year.

WR Chris Cole  (Den) is expected to play with a sore elbow.

WR Germane  Crowell (Det) will not play this week. He is recovering from a 
broken  foot.

WR Desmond Howard (Det) missed Wednesday's  practice, but isexpected to play 
this week.

WR Corey Bradford  (GB) is back on the injury report with a quad strain. He 
has not  practiced and is doubtful for this week.

WR Terrence Wilkins  (Ind) was criticized heavily by the coach to the media 
this week. Coach  Mora has stated that E.G. Green will see more playing time 
this  week.

WR Marvin Harrison (Ind) has practiced with his  stiff neck and will play 
this week.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)  used the bye week to get healthier. He is expected to 
play this  week.

WR Tony Martin (Mia)  is expected to play this week with a sore foot. He will 
not start  though. Oronde Gadsden and Leslie Shepherd will be the  starters.

WR Terry Glenn (NE) signed a six year contract  extension. ""She"" should be 
there for many years to come.

WR Jake  Reed (NO) is out with a broken fibula.

WR Ron Dixon  (NYG) did not practice Wednesday and will likely be rested to 
get  healthier.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ) is expected to play  with his sore shoulder.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) is expected  to play with his sore back.

WR Laveranues Coles (NYJ)  will also return kickoffs after the team cut Kevin 
Williams.  

WR Charles Johnson (Phi) is expected to play with a  sore shoulder.

WR Sean Dawkins (Sea) was held out of  practice Wednesday and Thursday with a 
sore quadricep. He is listed as  questionable on the injury report.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Sean Dawkins (Sea)  practiced Friday and looks like 
he'll play at least  some.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed Wednesday's and  Thursday'spractices with a very 
tender toe. He's listed as questionable and  could be
a game-time decision. Tai Streets and JJ Stokes will see extra  action if 
Owens can not go.
?
*** Saturday Update? WR Terrell Owens  (SF) took part in about 70% of 
Friday's practice.? Coach Steve  Mariucci is reportedly leaning towards not 
starting Owens Sunday although it  seems likely he'll play at least some.? 
The amount he could play will be  determined by how Owens feels at gametime.? 
This is so tough to call as  he's one of the elite WRs in the game and 50% of 
Terrell Owens is better than  100% of lots of other WRs.? People always want 
numbers so here's my  opinion:? 
Chances he doesn't play at all:?  25%
Chances he plays but contributes less than his  normal numbers: 50%
Chances he plays and looks like the Owens we've  been seeing: 25%
Weigh that out for what it's worth and make the  call that best suits your 
team and situation.? He's a high risk, high  reward decision this week.? If 
you're pretty well set and just need a few  points out of your WR slot, I'd 
probably bench him and find another guy.?  If you need to swing for the 
fences, I'd probably be inclined to gamble on him  and keep your fingers 
crossed.? 

WR Derrick Mason (Ten) is the  least hurt of all the receivers and will start 
on Sunday. He is battling a sore  back and ankle. He practiced on Thursday.

WR Chris Sanders (Ten)  is listed as questionable on the injury report, but 
expects to start  with his sore back and ribs. He practiced on Thursday.

WR Yancey  Thigpen (Ten) shockingly appears on the injury report as 
questionable  this week. For those that have followed his career, this 
usually means he will  not play. 
?
***Saturday Update? WR Yancey Thigpen  (Ten) surprised us and put together 3 
solid days of practice at the end  of the week.? Coach Fisher was even 
talking about the Titans taking some  shots downfield and Thigpen figuring 
into the gameplan.? We've heard this  before so be careful.? 

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) is  still bothered by a hamstring and was not able to 
practice at full speed. He is  not likely to make much of an impact this week.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Carl Pickens (Ten)  is inactive for this week.

WR Kenny Shedd (FA)  was signed by  Washington.

//////////////////////////////////////

Tight  Ends in the News:

TE Chris Gedney (Ari) has sore ribs, but is  expected to play. He practiced 
on Wednesday and Thursday.

TE  Derek Brown signed with Arizona.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)  will likely be held out one more week with his ailing 
shoulder. Casey  Crawford gets the start at tight end now that Wesley Walls 
is lost for the  year.

*** Saturday Update? TE David Sloan  (Det) was added to the injury report 
with a hamstring injury and is  questionable according to my friend Steve 
Cohen of Pro Football News and Injury  Report.? He's a gametime decision now.
?
*** Saturday Update? TE Tyrone Davis  (GB) has a torn rotator cuff that will 
require surgery in the  offseason.? In the meantime, he's falling behind 
Bubba Franks for the  primary TE job.

TE Eric Bjornson (NE) has lost  his starting job to Rod Rutledge.

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)  is expected to play with his sore knee.
?
*** Saturday Update TE Anthony Becht's  (NYJ) prospects are looking better 
with Fred Baxter's injury.?  
?
TE Freddie Jones (SD) has turf  toe, but is expected to play through the pain.

TE Stephen  Alexander (Was) is on a bye this week and will not  play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Kickers in  the News:

PK Matt Stover (Bal) has a sore finger, but it will  not keep him from 
kicking on Sunday.

PK Mike Vanderjagt (Ind)  inked a five year contract extension.

PK Sebastian  Janikowski (Oak) left the hospital so he may go on Monday. He 
is listed  as questionable, but has not practiced. The Raiders have looked at 
Brett Conway  and Chris Boniol, but have not signed either one. We will watch 
this one close  for you Friday and Saturday.
?
*** Saturday Update? PK Sebastian  Janikowski (Oak) is still not 100%.? He 
tested his foot today and  according to ESPN's John Clayton, the results were 
less than encouraging.?  He may still go but I'd look elsewhere this week.

PK Jeff Wilkens  (StL) is expected to handle FGs this week. Jeff Hall was 
signed earlier  in the week and will perform kickoffs and is the backup to 
Wilkens if he can't  kick.

PK Eddie Murray (FA) was signed by  Washington.

PK Scott Bentley (FA) was signed by  Washington.

PK Kris Heppner (Was) was released after his  several miscues cost the team a

1
STATEMENT FROM SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER III

The American people voted on November 7.  Governor George W.
Bush won 31 states with a total of 271 electoral votes.  The
vote in Florida was very close, but when it was counted,
Governor Bush was the winner.

Now, three days later, the vote in Florida has been recounted.
Over two-thirds of the state election supervisors overseeing
the recount are Democrats.

At the end of this recount, Governor Bush is still the winner,
subject only to counting the overseas ballots, which have
traditionally favored the Republican candidate.  No evidence of
vote fraud either in the original vote or in the recount has
been presented.

Now the Gore campaign is calling for yet another recount in
selective and predominantly Democratic counties where there
were unexplained large vote swings in their favor in the
recount.

It appears that the Gore campaign is attempting to unduly
prolong the country's national Presidential election through
endless challenges to the results of the vote here in Florida.

Furthermore, the more often ballots are recounted, especially
by hand, the more likely it is that human errors, like lost
ballots, and other risks, will be introduced.  This frustrates
the very reason why we have moved from hand counting to
machine counting.

Let me say a word specifically about the Palm Beach ballot.
There is a rule of law to be followed for elections.  The state
of Florida has established legal procedures to design, approve,
publish and, if need be, to protest ballots before the election.
The ballot was designed by a Democratic elections supervisor.
She approved it.  The Democratic Party did not question it
before the election.  This ""butterfly""-type ballot was used in
recent elections in the same county under the same rules.  Again,
the Democrats did not complain.  The overwhelming majority of
voters who used the ballot understood it and cast valid votes.
Our lawyers have confirmed the legality of this ballot, and we
have copies of the relevant Florida statute available for you
to see.

The Gore campaign has also tried to make a lot of the fact that
double marked ballots are not counted.  A key principle in
America is one person, one vote.  If we have ballots with two
votes, of course we cannot count them or guess about them.
Ballots that are double-marked can't be evidence of the voter's
intent to vote one way or another.  No jurisdiction in the
United States would accept such a ballot as a valid vote, and
Florida law specifically does not.  It happens in every
precinct in every election.  And the procedure is clear:  These
ballots must be disregarded.

We understand, and I understand personally, that it is
frustrating to lose by a narrow margin.  But it happens.  It
happened to the Republican Presidential candidates in 1960 and
1976.  Both Vice President Nixon and President Ford put the
country's interest first.  They accepted the vote for the good
of the country.

It is important that there be some finality to the election
process.  What if we insisted on recounts in other states that
are very close?  For example, in Wisconsin, Iowa, (and if we
don't win) New Mexico.

Let the country step back a moment, pause, and think about
what's at stake.  This may be the last chance.  There is no
reasonable end to this process if it slips away.

The purpose of our national election is to establish a
""Constitutional government,"" not unending legal wrangling.  We
will therefore vigorously oppose the Gore campaign's efforts to
keep recounting until it likes the result.  For the good of the
country and the sake of our standing in the world, the
campaigning should end, and the business of an orderly
transition should begin.

_________________________________________________________________

STATEMENT FROM BUSH COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR KAREN HUGHES:

""The vote count on Tuesday night showed Governor Bush won
Florida's election, and a recount has now confirmed his victory.
The only votes left to be counted are the overseas absentee
ballots, which in the past have favored Republican candidates.
Bob Dole carried the overseas ballots in Florida in 1996 by a
margin of 54 to 40 percent, even though he lost the election in
Florida.  We hope Vice President Gore and his campaign will
reconsider their threats of lawsuits or still more recounts,
which could undermine the constitutional process of selecting a
President and has no foreseeable end.""

DEMOCRATS URGE GORE TO QUIT LEGAL WRANGLING

""Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, questioned the
Gore campaign's wisdom in challenging the Palm Beach result.
The right thing, Mr. Breaux said, 'is to count the votes and
respect the decision,' without lengthy litigation. And Senator
Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, warned against
getting mired in the courts...

""'I want Al Gore to win the election,' Mr. Torricelli told
reporters, 'but more than that, I want somebody to win this
election. There is going to have to be a very compelling case
for anybody to take this into a court of law.'""
- The New York Times' R. W. Apple, Jr., 11/10/00

_________________________________________________________________

NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST, OTHERS: REVOTE OR COURT REMEDY
POLITICALLY UNSOUND AND LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE

""The problem is that potential remedies, such as a new election
in Palm Beach County, seem politically unsound and legally
questionable. The sad reality is that ballot disputes and
imperfections are a feature of every election. It will poison
the political atmosphere if presidential elections, in
particular, come to be seen as merely a starting point for
litigation.""
- New York Times, Editorial, 11/10/00
http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/10/opinion/10FRI1.html


""We say yes to counting a little more, but the legal action
about which Mr. Daley spoke elliptically should be approached
with enormous caution and restraint. Absent more than is
currently known, our sense is that either a lawsuit or a repeat
vote would raise at least as many questions as it would likely
resolve; the courts in the end can't legitimize the results.""
- Washington Post, Editorial, 11/10/00
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57302-2000Nov9.html


""Some folks are even calling for a rerun of the Florida
election.  It is important to decide this election by the rules
that 100 million Americans understood -- or should have
understood -- when they entered the voting booth Tuesday.  This
is not just about fair play for Al Gore and George W. Bush. It
is about defending a system that regards voting-day verdicts as
the final word, a concept that distinguishes this nation from
most others in the world.""
- San Francisco Chronicle, Editorial, 11/9/00


""'You know, I don't think the ballot was a problem, Bill and
I'll tell you why-is that there's one section I don't know if
people are really looking at, which relates to electronic or
electromechanical voting.  And in that particular case, what
the law says down here, it says 'Voting squares may be placed
in front of or in back of the names of candidates and
statements.'""
- CNN's ""Crossfire,"" Greta Van Susteren,  11/09/00


""If you start saying the ballot should be thrown out because
of confusion, I think that cases like that could be brought all
over the country.""
- CNN's Larry King Live, Bill Schneider, 11/8/00

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jermaine Lewis , WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 With Travis Taylor now out for the season, expect Lewis to line up as the 
second wideout along with Qadry Ismail. Lewis assumed that spot in last 
Sunday's game against Cincinnati and caught four passes for 25 yards. He 
needs to perform well over the season's final weeks to be in the Ravens' 
receiving picture for 2001.  

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Pollard put up decent numbers in Sunday's game at Soldier Field against the 
Bears.  He caught three passes for 42 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss.    

 E.G. Green , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first game back in seven weeks, Green pulled in five passes for 45 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  He may see some increased playing time 
in the offense, and could even spend some time as the Colts' number two 
receiver in the offense.     

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first productive game in weeks, Pathon caught three passes for 58 
yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  Pathon may see more 
looks in the offense in the coming weeks, as Head Coach Jim Mora looks to 
spread the ball around a bit more through the air.     

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dilger posted his second consecutive good outing for the Colts this weekend, 
catching five passes for 66 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss to the Bears at 
Soldier Field. He now has 36 receptions for 441 yards and three touchdowns on 
the season.     

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/09/00 
 James complied 117 yards of total offense and scored two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's 27-24 loss to the Bears.  He is now second in the league with 13 
touchdowns, one behind the Rams' Marshall Faulk. He could very well surpass 
Faulk this week against the Jets - he has scored at least one touchdown in 
each of his last four games.        

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 11/09/00 
 Christie kicked his second consecutive game-winning field goal for the Bills 
this week in New England.  He hit on a 48-yarder in the fourth quarter to 
send the game to overtime, then sealed the win with a 32-yard boot in the 
extra session. He kicked three field goals in all, and is now 20-of-23 in 
field goal attempts on the season.       

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 McDaniel caught only one pass for 24 yards in Sunday's game against the 
Patriots.  In spite of the poor performance, McDaniel is still second on the 
team in both receptions (27) and receiving yards (443).    

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/09/00 
 Price caught three passes for 36 yards in Sunday's win against the 
Patriots.  Although he is on pace to improve on all of his numbers from a 
year ago, Price has been a bust as far as Fantasy owners are concerned.    

 Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Bills' tight end had a solid Fantasy performance on Sunday, catching six 
passes for 49 yards and a touchdown.  Riemersma has historically had good 
success when Doug Flutie starts for the Bills, so keeping him in the lineup 
this week may be a good idea.     

 Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Baja Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith saw his first action in the last six weeks, but got only three carries 
for 13 yards in Sunday's game at Foxboro.  He won't get much playing time for 
the rest of the year, and will likely look to leave Buffalo at the end of the 
season.      

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries in Sunday's game  against  New 
England.  He ran the ball 13 times for 60 yards in Buffalo's 16-13 overtime 
victory.     

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bradford isn't expected to play Sunday against Tampa Bay after injuring the 
quadriceps muscle near his right knee. The Packers will probably sit Bradford 
and give him time to rest. He is just getting in shape after missing seven 
games this season because of a broken leg. Donald Driver will probably take 
his place as the third receiver.    

 Ahman Green , RB GB - FIBSABs Updated 11/09/00 
 Dorsey Levens had arthropscopic surgery on his injured knee Tuesday so Green 
will likely be the starting back for the rest of the season.  He has played 
well in 2000 gaining 474 yards and scoring four touchdowns.  Green still has 
a penchant for fumbling, and has done so three times this season, but he 
managed to hold on to the ball in a rainy game vs. Minnesota Monday.     

 Titans , DT TEN - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 It's highly likely that Tennessee's defense is on a roster in every Fantasy 
league, but you might want to look into acquiring it in a trade for the 
remainder of the season. The Titans' D has four games against some of the 
league's youngest quarterbacks over its final seven games - Spergon Wynn of 
Cleveland twice, and Akili Smith of Cincinnati and Donovan McNabb of 
Philadelphia once.   

 Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Howard is expected to play in Sunday's game against Atlanta.  He sat out 
last week's matchup against the Dolphins due to a neck injury.    

 Derrick Mason , WR TEN - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 Receiver and kick returner Mason practiced yesterday despite suffering from 
ankle and back injuries. He is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury 
report for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Sanders was able to practice with the Titans yesterday, and didn't appear to 
be suffering from any effects from a rib cartilage strain that knocked him 
from last Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Tennessee will rely on him if 
Carl Pickens or Yancey Thigpen can't play Sunday against Baltimore.  

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Edinger is finally beginning to settle into the job as the Bears' 
placekicker.  He made 4-of-8 field goals to start the season but has 
connected on his last seven field-goal attempts, including kicks of 41 and 37 
yards last Sunday. Edinger is now 11-of-15 for the season, including 4-of-7 
from beyond the 40.     

 Yancey Thigpen , WR TEN - FIBSABs Updated 11/09/00 
 Thigpen got a second opinion Tuesday about his injured left ankle, which 
confirmed that he has a condition that will hamper him for the rest of the 
season. He received an injection and was able to practice comfortably 
yesterday, and looks to be on the mend. We'll keep tabs on Thigpen's status 
for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/09/00 
 Robinson is on the verge of surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the second 
consecutive season.  Robinson has made seven of the Bears' eight longest 
plays from scrimmage this season, including all five of his touchdown 
receptions. He has catches of 68, 58, 55 and 48 yards from Cade McNown and a 
34-yard TD pass from Jim Miller.   

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Klap Updated 11/09/00 
 Pickens missed yesterday's practice with his hamstring injury, and the 
Titans are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards his status. He is still 
sore and appears unlikely to post good numbers even if he does play.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Although George was unable to practice yesterday due to a toe injury, Coach 
Jeff Fisher says he would have participated some had the session been 
conducted on grass instead of artificial turf. George is expected to play 
Sunday against Baltimore, although keep in mind that the Ravens have the 
NFL's top-ranked rush defense.  

 Scott Dragos , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dragos is still suffering from an injured quadriceps and is questionable for 
Sunday's game at Buffalo.  He played a major role as a blocker for James 
Allen when Curtis Enis was inactive.  With Enis back the Bears don't need 
Dragos as much for blocking but may use him as their long snapper.  Regular 
long snapper Pat Mannelly has an injured elbow and is questionable for 
Sunday's game as well.    

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith was limited in practice because of his hamstring and knee injuries, 
but he will return to action Sunday against Seattle. Smith missed 
Jacksonville's last game October 29 against Dallas, but was able to rest over 
the bye week last week.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 McNown is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game at Buffalo.  Head coach Dick 
Jauron said that McNown may be used as the emergency QB if his seperated left 
shoulder continues to improve this week.      

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 11/09/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebacker Hardy Nickerson, who underwent 
arthroscopic knee surgery last Friday, for Sunday's game against Seattle. 
Linebackers Lonnie Marts and Brant Boyer, both suffering from groin injuries, 
are listed as questionable on the injury report. Eric Storz and Kevin Hardy 
would be the likely replacements if neither can play. Defensive end Renaldo 
Wynn practiced yesterday and may return to action Sunday after missing four 
games with a torn MCL in his right knee. Defensive tackle Gary Walker will 
play after missing Jacksonville's last game against Dallas October 29.  

 Derek Brown , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Cardinals re-signed Brown on Wednesday after tight end Jay Tant was lost 
for the season with a torn ACL.  Brown had played for the Cardinals since 
1992 but was cut before the start of this season.      

 Jay Tant , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Tant tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during last 
Sunday's 16-15 win against the Redskins.  He will miss the remainder of the 
season.   

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Patten, who has played sparingly the past three weeks with a turf toe 
injury, is listed as doubtful on the Browns' injury report. He missed 
practice yesterday and is unlikely to make any Fantasy impact Sunday against 
New England.

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 The Hawks activated Mutombo from the injured list today, and he will play 
his first game of the season tomorrow night in Phoenix. He is now cured from 
a mild case of malaria and should help boost an Atlanta team that started 
0-5.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Barros, who has missed all four of Detroit's games this season because of a 
back injury, is reprortedly making good progress and could be back sooner 
than expected.  He has started running and is participating in shooting 
drills and scrimmages.     

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Harris is scheduled to dress for tonight's game in Washington, but is 
unlikley to see any action.  He is not  expected to be available to the team 
until Saturday.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Sura, sidelined with a strained lower back, is expected to return to the 
active roster after the Warriors conclude a four-game road trip on November 
19.  He did some light running with his team during practice Monday and hopes 
to begin practicing next week.     

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Cummings will be out indefinitely after suffering  a fractured cheekbone.  
He is scheduled to have plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will play more minutes as the backup point guard in 
his absence.    

 Ricky Davis , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Davis dribbled and shot on the side on Tuesday, but insists he won't be able 
to return to the team until December.  Head Coach Pat Riley said a decision 
could be made today as to whether or not Davis will need surgery to repair 
his injured foot.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/08/00 
 Sprewell is reportedly suffering from back spasm which may keep him out of 
tonight's game against the Cavaliers.  Sprewell is currently tied for second 
on the team in scoring, averaging 13.0 points per game.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Ceballos was benched in Saturday's loss to the Bucks, and Head Coach George 
Irvine wouldn't say whether he would be back in the lineup tonight against 
the Sixers.  Irvine is reportedly fed up with Ceballos' lack of conditioning 
and defensive intensity.     

 Randy Brown , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Brown will start at the point for Boston until Kenny Anderson returns from a 
fractured jaw. In his first start, Brown finished with four assists, two 
rebounds and no points in a 30-point loss to the Raptors.    

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Hammonds is now eligible to be removed from the injury list.  Head coach 
Flip Saunders hasn't made a decision yet but said that among the players on 
the list Hammonds, who is suffering from sore ankles, is the only one healthy 
enough to play.    

 Tracy Murray , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Murray, last season's eighth-best three-point shooter has played sparingly 
for the Nuggets so far.  He played eight minutes in Monday's game against 
Dallas and got limited action in the season opener against Seattle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Buckner's injured right foot is getting better but it is still not known yet 
when he will be able to return.  He said he won't be out for no longer than a 
week but head coach Don Nelson stated that it could be two weeks.  Buckner is 
suffering from a sprained ligament in his right foot.  Hubert Davis and 
rookie Courtney Alexander have gotten extended playing time in his absence.   
 

 William Avery , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 With Chauncey Billups in town, Avery has gotten very little playing time for 
the Timberwolves so far this season.  He has appeared in two of the T'Wolves 
four games this season playing only two minutes.  Billups is starting at 
shooting guard and is being used the backup point guard as well.    

 Damon Jones , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Reserve guard Damon Jones left Monday's game in the first half with a 
concussion.  He is questionable for Wednesday's game against Dallas.    

 Tony Massenburg , F VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Massenburg confirmed reports on Monday that he has asked for a trade. The 
nine-year veteran signed a three-year free-agent contract with Vancouver in 
the off-season. Grizzlies general manager Billy Knight said he is not 
contemplating a deal for Massenburg.  Massenburg is a bruising rebounder but 
will have very little Fantasy value wherever he plays.  

 Gary Payton , G SEA - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 Payton has been the ultimate Ironman in his career with the Sonics.  His 
game against Orlando marked the 319th consecutive start for him, dating back 
to March 18, 1996, the longest active streak in the NBA.  The last game he 
missed was March 15, 1996, against Dallas when he served a one-game 
suspension that snapped his career-high consecutive games played streak at 
354.  

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/08/00 
 McDyess played in Monday's game against Denver despite suffering from back 
spasms.  He played 31 minutes without aggravating his injury, scoring 12 
points and grabbing 11 rebounds.     

 Howard Eisley , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 He is backing up Steve Nash at point guard but head coach Don Nelson is 
using Eisley to finish games for Dallas.  Fifty-five percent of Eisley's 
total points and 41 percent of his assists this season have come in the final 
12 minutes of the game.  He scored 10 of his 14 points in Monday's game 
against Denver in the fourth quarter.    

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Williams missed Tuesday's game against the Lakers because of a sprained left 
knee.  He injured the knee when he landed awkwardly on it Sunday against 
Phoenix.   Williams will be evaluated on a day to day basis.  For now he is 
questionable for Thursday's game against Vancouver.  Matt Bullard started at 
small forward in his absence.     

 Juwan Howard , F WAS - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 Howard took a hard shot to his left eye during Tuesday night's game against 
the Bulls.  He left the floor dazed, but would later return to the game. He 
finished the contest with eight points and ten rebounds.   

 Brad Miller , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Miller broke his right hand on Tuesday night and could miss up to a month.  
He broke a bone in the base of his hand as he was grabbing a rebound against 
the Wizards. He had five points and eight rebounds in Chicago's 88-83 loss.   
 

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Sabonis could be back for part of the Blazers' Eastern Conference swing, 
which begins Monday in New Jersey.  He has missed all four of the Blazers' 
regular season games while he recovers from a knee injury.    

 Matt Geiger , C PHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 11/07/00 
 Geiger, who is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, went 
through his first full practice yesterday at the Philadelphia College of 
Osteopathic Medicine.  He is eligible to come off the disabled list after 
tomorrow night's game, but the team hasn't disclosed any definite date as to 
when he will return.    

 Sherman Douglas , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Douglas twisted his left ankle slightly during practice on Monday, but is 
expected to be available tomorrow night when the Nets visit the Wizards. He 
is averaging 7.3 points, 1.0 assists and 1.3 rebounds through three games 
this season.      

 Tom Gugliotta , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Gugliotta went through his first practice on Monday since having major 
recontructive knee surgery eight months ago.  He damaged both his anterior 
cructiate and medial collateral ligaments in a game against Utah last March.  
He hopes to begin playing in games in about two weeks.   

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/07/00 
 The Atlanta Journal Constitution is reporting that Mutombo will definitely 
play on Thursday night against the Suns.  He missed most of the preseason and 
the first four games of the regular season after suffering a mild case of 
malaria.   

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/07/00 
 Sprewell was told to watch what he says about Chris Webber joining the 
Knicks in a meeting with league officials on Monday.  In the meeting, 
officials described exactly what the NBA's tampering rules were, and how they 
apply to players.  No disciplinary action was taken against the Knicks' 
forward.    

 Darvin Ham , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Ham will miss 3-4 months after undergoing foot surgery on Monday.  He 
injured the foot while going up for a rebound against the Pistons on Saturday 
night.  Ham averaged 6.0 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in his first 
three games of the season.  He will be replaced in the starting lineup by 
either Tim Thomas or Jason Caffey.      

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 11/07/00 
 Doctors have cleared Coleman to return to the court for the Hornets on 
Wednesday against the Magic.  He missed the entire preseason while adapting 
to new medication for his irregular heartbeat.  Head Coach Paul Silas said

playing time.

                      Election Day, Tuesday, November 7, 2000


  Dear Friend:

  I want to remind you that today is election day.  Our
  generation has a chance to make a difference - to send a
  signal that we want new leaders who trust you, not
  government.  You deserve a government for the 21st century
  -- a government that reflects your values -- your
  entrepreneurial spirit, your trust in initiative, and your
  commitment to leaving behind a better world than you
  inherited.

  Our Republican team would provide that kind of leadership.
  George W. Bush and all of our great Republican candidates
  will focus on results, not daily polls.

  The other side has been running non-stop negative attacks
  against our candidates.  Don't let their fear tactics
  succeed.  Please take your family and friends to the
  polls today and vote for George W. Bush and all of our
  great Republican team.

  Thank you very much.

  George P. Bush


_____________________________________________________________

  LAST CHANCE!

  The polls will close in a few hours.  The Party that best
  gets its voters to the polls will win.  Please forward
  this email to your friends and encourage them to vote.
  Thank you!

Brad Johnson on our week 10 cheatsheet
http://www.cheatsheets.net/week10sheet.htm

Brad Johnson Out, Jeff George to Start
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1101/851321.html    From the article:  Jeff
George was named the Washington Redskins' starting quarterback for Sunday's
game at Arizona.

Coach Norv Turner said George would start after Brad Johnson was unable to
practice Thursday for a second consecutive day. Johnson sprained a knee
ligament in Monday night's loss to Tennessee. George missed Wednesday's
practice to attend the birth of his son, his third child.

George signed a four-year, $18.25 million contract in April to back up
Johnson. He has yet to play a down this season and has taken only about 10
percent of the snaps in practice.

""He had a very good practice today,"" Turner said. ""He's into it, in terms of
what we're doing.""  The Redskins have a bye after the Arizona game, but
officials are uncertain whether Johnson will be able to return for the
following game, a Monday night trip to St. Louis.

""He's got a pretty tender knee,"" trainer Bubba Tyer said. ""Grade 2 sprains
could be two weeks, could be four weeks.""  Further complicating the
Redskins' offensive preparation for this week, three receivers are suffering
from injuries, with Irving Fryar the most serious. Fryar, who missed
practice Wednesday because of a rib-cartilage injury, returned Thursday but
is questionable for Sunday.

Albert Connell practiced despite a sore right shoulder and is probable. And
James Thrash also practiced despite a strained thigh muscle and is probable.


My View:  I'm sure Jeff George isn't available in your league but if he's on
your roster, now might be the time to consider him.  I'm not overly excited
though as Arizona has a pretty tough pass defense.  Over the last four
weeks, they rank # 5 in passing yards allowed per game.  For the season,
they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed by the Opposing QB so they're not
quite as tough there.   This could likely be an audition for 2001 as many
feel George is the Redskin QB of the future.  A strong performance could
easily cause problems for the remainder of this year as Washington tries to
sort out the QB position.  WRs Albert Connell and James Thrash are both
listed as probable and should be good to go. At this point in the year,
nobody is 100%.  RB Larry Centers does such a nice job catching the ball out
of the backfield that TE Stephen Alexander has been ineffective.

allowed per game over the last four weeks so the matchup is  enticing.

Prime Matchups:? These games favor the  Offense?

Sammy Morris  / Shawn Bryson (Buf) vs Colts Defense??  Keep an eye on who c=

go for the Bills this week but whoever starts will  likely have some good=
=20
rushing numbers on the carpet in Indiana.? There were some semi encouraging=
=20
signs  that Morris might be back. The Colts rank just # 25 over the last 4=
=20
weeks  in rushing yards allowed  per game.? They=01,re  soft on the run and=

someone could make a big splash on Monday  Night.?

Charlie  Garner (SF) vs Saints Defense?? Just as they are with their pass =

 a=20
net here.? He proved his mettle once again last  week hammering against a=

tough Tampa team.?  The Cowboys also showed how little faith they have in=

their passing game  as they continued to feed Smith the ball even when=20
trailing badly. Washington  ranks # 21 over the last four weeks in rushing=

James Allen  (Chi) vs Patriot Defense?? What a mess Chicago finds itself =

offensive coordinator has left (been run  out of?) town for Utah and both=

starting WRs are gone for the year with  injuries.? James Allen may be the =

bright spot as he=01,s run hard and effectively.? The New England defense c=

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way?

Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Jaguar  Defense?? The Pittman injury watch=20

Eddie George (Ten) vs Bengal  Defense?? Most people have this image in  the=

heads of the Bengal defense laying down against the run.? Not so.? Over the=
=20
last four weeks, only 8 teams  are tougher in allowing rushing yards per=20

though it=01,s no slam dunk on the matchup.

James Stewart (Det) vs Packer Defense??  Depending on the weather and Charl=

Downside Matchups:? These games favor the  Defense

FIVE-DAY SUPER SALE: $158 RT COAST-TO-COAST
On Tuesday of this week, our coast-to coast airfares for $158 roundtrip
expired. Due to overwhelming demand, we have been able to convince our
suppliers to renew these special fares from select U.S. cities. This new
contract was signed and sealed at 11:00 a.m., this morning.
This sale will now be available for travel through February 15, 2001 and
tickets must be purchased by December 11, 2000. These special fares will
not be available to/from Florida from December 18, 2000 through January 4,
2001, seats are completely sold out. The good news is that if you can fly
to Florida between January 5 and February 15, 2001, we have many airfares
ranging between $110 and $128 roundtrip. Airfares to/from California,
Arizona, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, Utah and New Mexico to/from over 20
eastern U.S. cities range between $158 to $198 roundtrip.

We worked hard to extend this sale and our travel clubs will remain open
Thursday through Monday, including this weekend until 11:00 p.m. (CST).
Don't miss out on what could be the last super sale of 2000. For more
details, visit http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=10067898.

Davis (knee) is listed as probable for Sunday's game. You should have no reservations about starting him against the Chiefs. <BR>

According to published reports, Allen will split carries with Anthony Thomas on Sunday against Green Bay. Thomas is expected to start, but Allen will spell the rookie during the game. <BR>

Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual. <BR>

Robinson's prognosis for recovery from surgery to repair two ligaments in his left knee is seven to nine months. That would put him on target to return around the start of training camp next season, but you should check back on his status during the summer.<BR>

Defensive back Bryant Westbrook has been listed as out for Sunday's game against Tennessee. This could mean big things for Steve McNair and the Titans' passing game, who should have an easy time beating Detroit's corners on a regular basis. <BR>

Morris, who is recovering from knee surgery, was not placed on injured reserve by the Chiefs. There is a chance he might be activated late in the year, but it is doubtful that he will help Fantasy leaguers this season.<BR>

Anders, a three-time Pro Bowler, was released by the Kansas City Chiefs Friday. Anders, who had spent his entire 10-year career with the Chiefs, never recorded more than 400 rushing yards in a single season but went to the Pro Bowl as a fullback for his blocking and receiving. <BR>

Smith, the leading rusher in Minnesota Vikings history, is retiring after eight injury-plagued seasons. His agent, Neil Cornrich told members of the media that Smith has decided to ""embark on another aspect of his professional life."" <BR>

If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - The Guzzlers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=146325&""><B>Jeff Garcia</B></A>, QB SF - The Guzzlers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=1174&""><B>Eddie George</B></A>, RB TEN - Thrill Kill Cult <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=1612&""><B>Oronde Gadsden</B></A>, WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=12207&""><B>Fred Beasley</B></A>, RB SF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=1511&""><B>Joe Horn</B></A>, WR NO - The Lie Downs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=12431&""><B>Donald Hayes</B></A>, WR CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=12797&""><B>Kurt Warner</B></A>, QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.

Rich Gannon</B></A>, QB OAK - The Executioners <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=12576&""><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Meximullets <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=235122&""><B>Marvin Minnis</B></A>, WR KC - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year.

He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=235213&""><B>Rod Gardner</B></A>, WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Aaron Brooks  (NO)? We keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering.? =20

QB Kordell Stewart  (Pit)? Kordell made our upgrade list last week and here=

he sits  again.? It took a few years, but he's showing folks that maybe 199=

Kent  Graham was so bad I won't even mention him in the downgrades but he p=

QB Jay Fiedler  (Mia)? Dan Fouts said on Monday Night Football a few weeks=

Jerry  Rice's wife?harping on the radio had some sort of positive effect.? =

it  goes but at least it looks as if he'll get his shot.

RBs Moving  Up

RB Mike Anderson  (Den)? Like you need me to tell you this.? The fact that=
=20
he  ran buck wild on a tough New Orleans defense made the effort all the=20
more  impressive.? He bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to=

be  good for Sunday.? Clearly, the Denver OL is the star on this team so if=
=20
you  own Anderson, it's probably not a bad idea to grab KaRon Coleman for t=
he=20
stretch  run.?=20

RB Fred Taylor  (Jac)? For all the early?ripping I've done to Taylor, he's =
=20
performed just as we predicted he would lately - like a madman.? You don't =
=20
need me to tell you he's been awesome.

RB Warrick Dunn  (TB)? Can the little guy take up the slack for Mike=20
Alstott??  I've got a couple hundred reasons that says ""yes"".? Ok, rushing=
=20
for 200+  against Dallas is nothing special (it's happened in 23% of the=20
Cowboys games  this year) but you have to admit Dunn looked great  Sunday.?

RB Corey Dillon  (Cin)? One can only salivate about what he might do if he=
=20
played  for a team like Denver.? The fact he can continue to roll up huge=
=20
yardage  on this team is amazing.? New QB Scott Mitchell is a huge boost as=
=20
he looks  like Peyton Manning back there compared to Akili  Smith...

RB Ahman Green  (GB)? Green's a guy that's finally living up to his =20
potential.? You always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to =
=20
be catching up mentally as well.? He showed a nice nose for the endzone =20
Sunday with the 2 TDs.

RB Lamar Smith  (Mia)? So much for the cold weather hamstring worries.?=20
Smith  carried the load Sunday in frigid Buffalo and looked great.? It look=
s=20
to me  like he's picking up right where he left off.

RB Terrell Fletcher  (SD)? It's not exactly the same as earning the startin=
g=20
RB job in  Tennessee or Indianapolis, but Fletcher does seem to have nailed=
=20
down the #1 RB  slot in San Diego.? And that's worth something.? You have t=
o=20
decide  how much...

RB Fred Beasley  (SF)? We loved Beasley early in the season as he racked up=
 =20
TDs.? He got back in the mix Sunday with 5 carries and a TD.? The FB  for S=
an=20
Francisco has always been a valuable FF slot and Beasley might be worth  th=
e=20
roll of the dice if you're thin at RB.

RB Shawn Bryson  (Buf)? Finally, Bryson does something besides make me look=
=20
bad for  hyping him.? He rolled up 88 yards on just 12 attempts Sunday and=
=20
looks to  take advantage of Sammy Morris' ankle troubles.?=20

RB Terry Allen  (NO)? Allen made an appearance Sunday and with Jerald Moore=
=20
and  Chad Morton failing to astound anyone, Allen could get more looks.?=20
Whether  he's got anything left in the tank remains to be seen.

?

WRs Moving  Up

WR David Boston  (Ari)?? Boston turned in a huge game Sunday and has to be =
=20
considered an upgrade.? He's a streaky guy but with Frank Sanders a total =
=20
non factor, Boston is getting most of QB Jake Plummer's attention these =20
days.? And with Arizona almost certain to be playing from behind, he could =
=20
do some damage.

WR Darrell Jackson  (Sea)? Jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had=20
cooled of  late.? He warmed up again Sunday with Jon Kitna under center.?=
=20
It's  tough to depend on the Seahawk passing game but Jackson could be wort=
h=20
a  shot.

WR Curtis Conway  (SD)? Conway has benefited the most from the Ryan Leaf =
=20
resurgence.? He caught 7 passes Sunday and should benefit as Leaf continues=
 =20
to improve.

WR Willie Jackson  (NO)? Jackson's officially moved past the ""flash in the=
=20
pan"" stage  with another solid day.? Aaron Brooks continues to look good at=
=20
QB.?  Jackson may suffer a bit when Jake Reed gets healthy but for right no=
w,=20
he's  looking good.

WR Joe Horn  (NO)? Again, QB Aaron Brooks delivers and Horn is the prime =
=20
recipient.? Joe Horn is one of the better stories of 2000 and he should =20
continue to shine especially if the rushing game doesn't get  untracked.

WR Bobby Shaw  (Pit)? Shaw may still be available in your league as the=20
starting  WR opposite Hines Ward.? He found the endzone again and continues=
=20
to make  some noise with Kordell Stewart quarterbacking.

WR Terrell Owens  (SF)? The best news for Jeff Garcia owners had to be a=20
solid day  from Terrell Owens.? He's a huge boost to the offense when he ca=
n=20
go and it  looked like he'd made progress with the toe.? Keep an eye out fo=
r=20
how he  responds after the game but I liked what I saw.

WR Shockmain Davis  (NE)? Ok, I'll be honest.? I'm pretty much just includi=
ng=20
him  here because he's the owner of the coolest name in the  league...

?

TEs Moving  Up

TE Dwayne Carswell  (Den)? Carswell's finally starting to emerge as the TE =
of=20
choice  in Denver.? His 62 yards Sunday were second only to San Diego's=20
Freddie  Jones.? You have to worry about Desmond Clark stealing time but I'=
d=20
have no  trouble starting Carswell each week.

TE Reggie Kelly  (Atl)? One of the few bright spots for Atlanta has been th=
e=20
play  of Kelly.? He caught 4 passes for 44 yards Sunday with a TD.? New QB =
=20
Doug Johnson may lean on him as he settles in.

TE Mark Bruener  (Pit)? Bruener makes the list not only for having another=
=20
solid  game but for making one of the best TD runs after the catch Sunday a=
s=20
he piggy  backed a defender into the endzone after refusing to go down at t=
he=20
5 yard  line.

TE Andrew Glover  (NO)? Obviously, the play of Aaron Brooks raises the leve=
l=20
of play  for all the Saints receivers.? Glover made a couple of nice plays=
=20
Sunday  including a good looking TD catch.

?

Players Moving  Down

QBs Moving  Down

QB Shane Matthews  (Chi)? Take a seat Shane.? Cade McNown likely makes his =
=20
return.? Folks can hardly wait...

QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Emmitt Smith owners had to love it but did it seem=
=20
strange  to anyone else that the Cowboys felt the best way to come back fro=
m=20
a huge  deficit against Tampa was to feed the ball to Emmitt?? Clearly, the=
=20
team  has zero faith in Aikman's ability to throw the ball.

QB Shaun King  (TB)? I know he's had trouble with the back but 65 passing =
=20
yards?? That's a joke.? He'll be better but I've seen  enough.

QB Brad Johnson  (Was)? It's the Jeff George show.? At least until?George =
=20
looks bad for a few series...

QB Rob Johnson  (Buf)? In leagues that penalize for interceptions, you'd ha=
ve=20
been  better off starting yourself this weekend than you would've Rob=20
Johnson.?  Once again, he starts the game but finishes holding a  clipboard=
.

?

RBs?Moving  Down

RB Jamal Anderson  (Atl)? Anderson's not playing too badly but the team is=
=20
in  shambles.? After QB Chris Chandler was benched, Anderson vented some =
=20
frustrations saying for all he knew, ""he might be punting this week"".? I =
=20
don't think we'll see that but I also don't think we'll see the days of him=
 =20
seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the year.

RB Shaun Alexander  (Sea)?? RB Ricky Watters has proven to be less than an=
=20
ideal  playmate refusing to share the ball.? Actually, he's played so well=
=20
that  Mike Holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow o=
f=20
his  star.? When the team is struggling as badly as it is, you don't mess=
=20
with  the one thing that's working.

Philadelphia  RBs? Forget about them.? This team will live and die by =20
Donovan McNabb.

RB Jermaine Fazande  (SD)? Evidently, Fazande is the 2nd choice behind=20
Terrell Fletcher  now.? That's gotta hurt...

?

WRs Moving  Down

WR Joe Jurevicius  (NYG)? This has nothing to do with the play of Jureviciu=
s=20
as he's  been very solid but you have to think Ike Hilliard will be a facto=
r=20
when he  returns.? He's no lock to go this week but he may be  close.

WR Terrance Mathis  (Atl)? Mathis continues to struggle on a team that's in=
=20
a  tailspin.? New QB Doug Johnson seemed to like throwing to Shawn Jefferso=
n =20
which could spell more bad things for Mathis.

WRs Torrance Small /  Charles Johnson (Phi)? Forget about it.? Donovan McNa=
bb=20
can  be a solid QB without WRs.

WRs James McKnight / Wayne  McGarity (Dal)? These guys just aren't very=20
McGood.? QB Troy  Aikman is a mere shadow of his former self.

WR Marcus Robinson  (Chi)? Robinson's back troubles were apparently more=20
serious than  many had expected.? It was announced Monday that he'll likely=
=20
miss the rest  of the season with a bulging disk in his back.? It appears h=

can get by  without surgery but he's certainly not looking good.

TEs Moving  Down

TEs Marcus Pollard / Ken  Dilger (Ind)? Neither of these guys did much=20
Sunday.? This  offense clearly isn't in the same groove it was earlier this=

year.? =20

TEs Jackie Harris / David  LaFleur (Dal)? More bad news associated with Tro=

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00 
 Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of 
schedule in his return from a sprained knee. If all goes well, he could play 
in the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale 
against Green Bay on December 24. It's probably best to keep Alstott on your 
bench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could 
make an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things 
quickly.  

 Chad Morton , RB NO - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a 
separated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last 
Sunday. We don't recommend him for your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Head Coach Jim Haslett says he hopes to re-sign Moore, who was placed on 
waivers on Saturday. Moore became expendable with the addition of veteran 
Terry Allen, and won't have any Fantasy value even if he returns.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Hatchette injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last Sunday's game 
against St. Louis. He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday 
against Green Bay. He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, 
though.  

 Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent 
surgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek. He suffered the injury 
during last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game. Walsh has 
been valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but 
he's not a viable Fantasy option.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00 
 The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during 
practice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against 
Cincinnati. He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's 
game, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards. 
Hopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at 
running back during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against 
Tennessee due to a sprained ankle. Believe it or not, this likely hurts the 
Browns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last 
Sunday against Philadelphia. It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this 
stage of the Fantasy season.  

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 12/12/00 
 Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to 
an over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday. Still, his 
status for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to 
keep him on your bench this week.  

 Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday 
against San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts. 
One possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when 
he was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to 
McNown. We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing 
the weak Niners' pass defense.   

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - Baja Updated 12/12/00 
 Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to 
practice on Wednesday. Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, 
we wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.  

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be 
benched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games. Nothing 
is worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer 
clear of both players if at all possible.  

 Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the 
final two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for 
2001. Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to 
determine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future. On the other hand, 
Beuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB 
and may not want to end it. Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your 
Fantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.  

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve 
on Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it 
certainly showed on Monday night. Although Indianapolis did score two 
defensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to 
Indy. Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their 
former selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your 
Fantasy team.   

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00 
 Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field 
goals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter. He is 
one of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly 
starter on your Fantasy team.   

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and 
hasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets. What little 
Fantasy value he may have had early in the season is all but gone now.   

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday 
night's win over Buffalo. He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, 
missing only two field goals the entire season. Starting Vanderjagt this week 
is a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many 
touchdowns.   

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, 
and hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five. Translation: Avoid starting 
Pollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.   

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on 
Monday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought. Avoid starting him if 
your roster allows it.  

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00 
 Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills. 
At this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.   

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two 
passes for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis. In the last two 
weeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns. 
Fantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy 
playoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.    

 Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Klap Updated 12/12/00 
 Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown 
performance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday 
night. Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a 
receiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two 
weeks of the season.    

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 12/12/00 
 To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in 
Monday night's game with the Bills. He caught only two passes for 27 yards 
against what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which 
may have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs. If you 
were lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against 
the Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins. In the team's first meeting, 
Harrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.     

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four 
passes for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts. These 
were the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from 
Price, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your 
starting lineup.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with 
an ankle injury. He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown 
in the Bills' 44-20 loss. Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn 
Bryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of 
Buffalo's tailbacks at this point.  

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, 
rushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.  His main production, however, came 
through the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards. Bryson's 120 yards 
of total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for 
Fantasy owners at this point in the season.    

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00 
 ""The Edge"" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 
yards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over 
Buffalo. James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him 
back in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone. When it comes really 
comes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it 
wouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy 
playoffs.  

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00 
 Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing 
13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win. 
It was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one 
touchdown pass in a game. If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy 
performance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami. The Dolphins 
have two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, 
so it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par 
performance. At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the 
former Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised 
kidney this week. Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers 
against an opportunistic Oakland defense.  

 Randy Jordan , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Jordan has a turf toe injury and will miss some practice time this week. He 
will play at Seattle but might be used sparingly.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Pickens was unable to play the full game Sunday against Pittsburgh after 
re-injuring his hamstring. He didn't have a catch for the second straight 
week, the first time in his career he has done that. If Pickens can't play 
Sunday, the ailing Titans will probably struggle against the tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Sanders, who was forced to leave Sunday's game against Pittsburgh with 
strained rib cartilage, may be limited in practice this week, but will likely 
play next Sunday against Baltimore. He had four catches for 70 yards in the 
game, and should continue to serve as one of the Titans' top two receivers 
(with Derrick Mason) as long as Carl Pickens and Yancey Thigpen are ailing. 
If Tennessee is forced to turn to another option, the only players left are 
inexperienced Chris Jackson and Chris Coleman.  

 Tony Martin , WR MIA - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Martin is expected to return to action this week against the Chargers.  He 
has been recovering from a stress fracture in his right foot that has kept 
him out of six games this season.    

 Al Del Greco , K TEN - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Del Greco missed a 24-yard field goal last Sunday against Pittsburgh, 
breaking a string of 46 straight from within 30 yards dating back to 1994. 
Still, he atoned for the miss by kicking the game-winner, a 30-yarder to 
close out the game, and added two other field goals. No reason to downgrade 
his value at this point.  

 Dolphins , DT MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/07/00 
 The Dolphins' defense put up another stellar effort on Sunday, holding the 
Lions to only eight points while playing at one of the NFL's toughest 
stadiums, the Silverdome. The Fish recorded two sacks, an interception, and 
recovered two fumbles in the game, while holding the Lions to only 268 yards 
of total offense. In injury news, linebacker Zach Thomas will miss this 
Sunday's game against the Chargers and may not be ready to play until after 
Miami's November 19th date with the Jets.  He is still recovering from a 
severely sprained ankle.  On a better note for Miami, defensive tackle Tim 
Bowens is expected to return to practice this week and will likely play 
against San Diego.        

 Steelers , DT PIT - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 The Steelers' defense held Tennessee to nine points Sunday, and extended its 
streak of not allowing a touchdown to 20 quarters. Despite a mistake late in 
the fourth quarter that allowed the Titans to win the game, the Steelers gave 
Fantasy owners another solid performance. Pittsburgh sacked Steve McNair once 
and intercepted him another time in the game. Expect another solid outing 
next Sunday, when Philadelphia comes to town.  

 Colts , DT IND - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 It looks like defensive end Ellis Johnson will miss his second consecutive 
game this week when the Colts host the Jets on Sunday night.  ""I don't know 
about Ellis,"" said Head Coach Jim Mora, ""I kind of have my doubts.""  Johnson 
is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.        

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Lie Downs Updated 11/07/00 
 Harrison took a wicked hit to the back at the end of Sunday's game in 
Chicago, and complained of a stiff upper neck on Monday.  The injury isn't 
considered serious, and Harrison is expected to play this week against the 
Jets.  Against the Bears, Harrison caught six passes for 42 yards but was 
held out of the end zone for the first time in three weeks.  It was also the 
first time in five games that Harrison has been held under 100 yards 
receiving.    

 Kent Graham , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Although he won't start Sunday against Philadelphia, Graham is likely to get 
another shot at the job if Kordell Stewart doesn't improve. Graham averaged 
208 passing yards in his first three games, while Stewart is averaging 128 
yards in his four starts. Neither will take your Fantasy team to a league 
title.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Coach Bill Cowher named Stewart his starter for Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, despite a disappointing 112-yard passing game last Sunday. If 
Pittsburgh can't get it's air game going, expect Kent Graham to be 
re-installed as the starter over the upcoming weeks.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Edwards didn't record a single reception Sunday against Tennessee, and in 
fact, dropped a key pass during the game. With his recent struggles, it's 
likely Hines Ward and Bobby Shaw will get the majority of the passes the rest 
of the way.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 11/07/00 
 The Bills' defense held the Patriots to only 13 points on a cold and rainy 
day at Foxboro.  They sacked New England quarterbacks three times and 
recorded two interceptions as well, while keeping the Bills in the game with 
some tough goal-line stances.  On the injury front, defensive end Phil Hansen 
has been able to walk without crutches, but his sprained knee is expected to 
keep him out of action for another three to five weeks.     

 Cory Geason , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Geason will be sidelined for at least the next few games with a sprained 
left knee ligament. The Steelers, who have few other blocking tight ends on 
the roster, may need to sign one.  

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Morris suffered a thigh bruise during Sunday's game against the Patriots.  
Despite the injury, he is expected to practice with the team on Wednesday. 
The rookie running back complied 86 yards of total offense in Buffalo's 16-13 
overtime victory.     

 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Bettis had just 42 rushing yards on 13 carries against one of the stingiest 
run defenses in the league, Tennessee, on Sunday. It was his lowest total 
since he had just eight yards in Week One against Baltimore. As a side note, 
Pittsburgh could be without center Dermontti Dawson for the rest of the 
season, and certainly will for at least the next few games due to a hamstring 
injury. Keep in mind that Bettis posted the lowest rushing yards total of his 
career (1,091) with Dawson missing nine games last season. We're not 
condemning Bettis, as he's still having a great season, but it's probably 
worth considering benching him against tougher defenses the rest of the way.  

 Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 The 'Skins expect to have both cornerback Darrell Green and outside 
linebacker Shawn Barber back for Washington's Monday night tilt with the Rams 
on November 20th. Green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle, 
while Barber has missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee.      

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Johnson will miss Washington's next game, a November 20th contest in St. 
Louis on Monday night.  He is not expected to return the Redskins' starting 
lineup until November 26th against the Eagles.  Head Coach Norv Turner, in an 
attempt to avoid a quarterback controversy, has already stated that Johnson 
will be the starter when he is healthy enough to play.     

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/07/00 
 George completed 20-of-39 passes for 276 yards but threw  two interceptions 
in Sunday's loss to the Cardinals.  He will likely start Washington's next 
game on November 20th against the Rams while starter Brad Johnson recovers 
from a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Cowboys' Head Coach Dave Campo said that he probably won't know until 
Wednesday if Aikman will be ready to go this Sunday against the Bengals.  The 
Cowboys' quarterback was scheduled to have a series of injections on Monday 
to relieve the inflammation in his lower back.  ""As tough as he is,"" said 
Campo, ""I wouldn't put it past him to be ready to go.""    

 Cardinals , DT ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 The Cards' defense put up a heroic effort on Sunday, holding the Redskins' 
offense to just 15 points in their big NFC East win.  In the game, cornerback 
Aeneas Williams returned a fumble 104 yards for a touchdown, tying the NFL 
record for the longest fumble returned for a score.  On the downside, Arizona 
placed defensive tackle Tony McCoy on the injured list, losing him for the 
remainder of the season. He had missed three games after having arthroscopic 
surgery on his right knee.  He will be replaced by Barron Tanner, whom the 
team signed as a free agent.    

 Pete Stoyanovich , K STL - The Lie Downs Updated 11/06/00 
 The Rams released kicker Pete Stoyanovich on Monday, a day after he missed 
two field-goal attempts in a loss to Carolina.  He missed badly from 37 and 
50 yards in the second quarter in Sunday night's 27-24 defeat at home.   The 
Rams are now looking to sign Jeff Hall who will take over as kicker until 
Jeff Wilkins recovers from his injured quadriceps.      

 Kris Heppner , K WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/06/00 
 The Redksins cut rookie Kris Heppner Monday.  Heppner was released by the 
Seahawks earlier this season.  The Redskins have a bye this week and will try 
out a number of prospects.  Among the many kickers they are considering 
hiring is 44-year old veteran Eddie Murray.    

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 11/06/00 
 Freddie Jones had another solid receiving week. He caught 5 passes for 86 
yards. Too bad he plays for a team with QB problems!  

 Justin Watson , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/06/00 
 Watson started in place of Marshall Faulk but didn't do tow well.  He gained 
just 12 yards on 12 carries but did manage to score on a short touchdown run. 
 

 Trent Green , QB STL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/06/00 
 Green was a Fantasy star once again this week, but in a losing effort.  He 
passed for a career-high 431 yards, completed 29-of-42 passes with two 
touchdowns and no interceptions.   

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 Leading the Panthers to the upset win, Beuerlein  completed 15-of-25 passes 
for 214 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.  Overall Beuerlein 
hasn't been as successful as he was last season but he is still just as 
effective.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 11/06/00 
 Robinson was a reliable Fantasy player once again on Sunday.  He had nine 
catches for 109 yards and scored a touchdown against the Colts.    

 Jim Miller , QB CHI - Ramiro Updated 11/06/00 
 Miller led the Bears to victory while starting for the injured Cade McNown 
Sunday.  He completed 24-of-35 passes for 214 yards and a touchdown.   

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 The NFL's leader in touchdown receptions didn't catch one on Sunday but he 
was still productive.  He caught six  passes for 97 yards.  Owens still leads 
the NFL with 11 TD receptions.     

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 Blake may have been the surprise star of Week 10, throwing three touchdown 
passes.  The Saints have generally relied on RB Ricky Williams to move the 
offense this season but they turned to Blake on Sunday and he did not 
disappoint.  Blake completed 20-of-26 passes for 275 yards.

Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Chris Chandler (Atl) is doubtful with a concussion. He has not
practiced all week. QB Danny Kanell will start in his place.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is expected to sit another week with a sore
shoulder. Doug Flutie gets the start again.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) still cannot throw and will not play this week.
Jim Miller starts in his absence.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) will start this week, but the coaches may give
him the quick hook should he struggle.

QB Troy Aikman (Dal) practiced with the first team Thursday and is
expected to start this week. If he cannot go because of his back,
Cliff Stoerner would start. Randall Cunningham is also hurt with a
sore knee and has not practiced.

QB Brian Griese (Den) continues to play through his ailments. This
week will be no different.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) has recovered from his concussion and is
expected to start this week.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) is expected to play with a sore elbow. Hint to
team, Maybe try throwing for less than 500 yards?

QB Daunte Culpepper (Min) does not appear on the injury report, but
has a sore knee. He is expected to start this week.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) was seen wearing a splint and did not practice
on Wednesday. The team is being very mum whether he will play or not.
John Friesz would get the start in his absence, but the team could
also use Michael Bishop if Friesz struggles. This is likely a
situation you should avoid if at all possible.

QB Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) still has a stiff neck, but has played
through it the last two weeks. Expect the same this week.

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) gets the start this week.

QB Jim Harbaugh (SD) is listed as questionable, but he will not
start. The team named Moses Moreno the starter earlier in the week.

QB Brock Huard (Sea) is not fully over his concussion. He is expected

practiced on Thursday.

report, but expects to start with his sore back and ribs. He
practiced on Thursday.

questionable this week. For those that have followed his career, this

?
As a followup to our followup today on Griese,  ESPN's John Clayton has 
more.? He's reporting that backup QB Gus Frerrotte  has been told he needs to 
be ready to play for the rest of the season.?  
?
Don't panic yet as it'll be a couple of days still  before they know exactly 
what they're dealing with. But the bottom line is this  seems to be getting 
worse by the minute.
?
I'm not a?huge Frerotte fan but if he winds up  starting, he'll be handed the 
keys to one of the more prolific offenses in the  league.? Between Mike 
Shanahan and Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubiak,  that's a great brain trust.? 
A healthy Terrell Davis, 2 great WRs and 3 TEs  that are all effective make 
for a nice system.
?
We'll stay on this for you.

?
?
Here's the full article from ESPN's Clayton for  more detail.? 
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1114/877559.html?? 
?
While not issuing an update on the injury Tuesday,  the Denver Broncos were 
fearful enough of losing quarterback Brian Griese because of his separated  
throwing shoulder that they told backup Gus Frerotte to be ready to play the  
rest of the season, ESPN.com's John Clayton reported.
?
Griese's injury is officially listed as a separated  AC joint. The Broncos 
said Tuesday they aren't likely to know about their  quarterback's 
availability for Sunday's game against San Diego until later in  the week. 

Griese was injured in the first quarter of  Denver's 27-24 win over Oakland 
on Monday night, but he returned to the lineup  and helped engineer the 
victory. 

""We won't know for a couple of days the exact  extent of the injury,"" coach 
Mike Shanahan said. ""We'll wait to see how sore he  is."" 

Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said Griese could be out  a ""significant period of 
time,"" adding, ""It looks bad."" 

Asked after the game if he expected to play  against the Chargers, Griese 
said, ""I don't know. I can't tell you what's going  to happen, what my 
availability will be for next week. I've never had an injury  like this, but 
I'm going to do my best to come back and play."" 

Griese already was playing with torn cartilage in  the same shoulder, which 
will require off-season surgery. He insisted the two  injuries are unrelated.

If you were one of the millions who dealt with the crowds during
Thanksgiving travel, you may be ready for another vacation. If that's the
case, you don't want to miss out on our $158 roundtrip coast-to-coast
super sale (travel through March 1) or our 50 percent off Caribbean sale
(travel through June 15, including the peak winter season). With cold
weather settling in across many parts of the country, 85-degree beaches
and a tall tropical drink sipped under a warming sun sounds pretty good.
If sunshine and beaches are not your cup of Long Island Tea, pick the spot
that hits your fancy and fly between over 58 U.S. cities coast-to-coast
for only $158-198 through March 28 (Florida travel is valid through March
14). As an added plus, check an offer that can make you an elite-level
frequent flyer with just one trip. Most frequent flyers have to rack up a
minimum of 25,000 airmiles to hit the first level of elite status, but we
can tell you how to do it quick and easy. We're posting many other goodies
on our News Desk by the hour. Add it to your bookmarks and visit regularly
to be among the first to know what's up in low fares.

COAST-TO-COAST FROM $158 THROUGH MARCH 1, 2001
Just in time for the holidays, we have coast-to-coast airfares as low as
$158 roundtrip. Chances are, we have the route you need. Please be aware
that travel to Florida will be almost impossible December 18-29 for those
who have not already purchased. Even First Class is almost completely sold
out. That leaves the rest of the country at your disposal on Bestfares.com
bargain fares, or you can book Florida for a welcome post-holiday stay.
We'll even waive that ferocious $40 fuel surcharge to add to your savings.
For example, travel to and from the West Coast--Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle or Portland--to Baltimore,
Hartford, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans, Houston and many more
cities for just $158 roundtrip. From the West Coast to Dallas, Minneapolis
or Milwaukee is just $190. From the West Coast to Boston, New York City,
Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Miami is only $238. Don't miss out on
these holiday and winter fares. Go home for the holidays (or relax
afterward) on these tempting fares. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898.

LAST 4 DAYS: $198 RT BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES THROUGH MARCH 31
If we don't have the coast-to-coast sale fare you need in one category,
we'll try another. This one requires fast action, with just four days left
to book, but it gives you an extra month of travel (March 1-31) plus
another bucket of fares to draw from. Business travelers face walk-up fare
increases of as much as $370, added since the first of the year. Leisure
travelers can use this sale to fly for slightly more than half of what
business travelers are paying in fare hikes alone. If you live in Seattle,
Portland (OR), Reno, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix or Los
Angeles, head east to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach (the home
of the challenging chad), Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Houston or
Chicago. There are many additional choices. Availability for December
travel is as tight as the smile on a Supreme Court Justice's face, but we
should be able to get you what you need for the remaining months. Don't
miss out on a sale that can save you hundreds of dollars. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898 and scroll to the applicabl=
e
headlines.

RT TO 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES FROM $328 THROUGH JUNE 15, 2001
They said it couldn't be done, but that's the kind of challenge we rise to
meet. The result--$328 roundtrip airfares from 40 U.S. cities to your
choice of 15 cities in the Caribbean for the 2001 peak winter travel
season. These fares can be 50 percent (or more) off standard published
fares. Think warm fun and island breezes in Cancun, St. Maarten, Aruba,
San Juan, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Montego Bay, Grand Cayman, Nassau and
four other Bahamas Islands. Golfers, how about Bermuda's extraordinary
courses? These fares are valid from over 40 U.S. cities starting at $328
roundtrip. Departure cities include New York City, Atlanta, Boston,
Buffalo, Philadelphia and Washington (DC). Our most expensive ticket
(still cheap) is from the West Coast, and it's only $458 roundtrip,
including Denver, Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San
Francisco and Seattle. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10088489.

RT BETWEEN 50 CENTRAL AND EAST COAST CITIES $198-218 THROUGH AUGUST 31
If you live in an expanded Central U.S. area that stretches from Texas to
Minnesota, in Atlanta, or in almost any major city to the east, fly to
dozens of destinations for $198-218 roundtrip. This deal includes New York
City, Boston, Myrtle Beach, many more southeast, southern and Texas cities
and over 50 cities in the Midwest. You can save up to 65 percent and lock
in sale fare travel through August 15, 2001. If you know where you'll be
heading for summer vacation, book now and cross one big planning problem
off your list. These fares also cover New Year's, Spring Break, Easter,
Memorial Day weekend and the Fourth of July. If you've checked out the
fares offered to the general public during these travel periods, you'll
realize what bargains we've negotiated. For details, visit

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge). ","David Oxley

              A MESSAGE FROM DONALD L. EVANS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Friend,

The election results in Florida have been certified in accordance
with Florida state law and the rulings of the Florida Supreme
Court, and Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that
state's 25 electoral votes.  It is now time to get on with the
business of organizing a new administration.

In order to begin that task, we have filed articles of
incorporation for the Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition
Foundation, a non-profit corporation.  As past transition
foundations have done, we have applied for 501(c)(4) status from
the Internal Revenue Service.  Now we are asking for your help as
our team moves forward with plans for an orderly transition
process in the short period between now and inauguration day,
January 20, 2001.

While the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended in
1988, specifically authorizes public funds for transitions, it
also makes provisions for raising contributions from private
sources to help defray transition-related expenses.  This has
been done previously, most recently in 1992.  We are now
soliciting contributions from our most active supporters.  Would
you please visit our new transition website at
http://www.bushcheneytransition.com and make a contribution on our
secure server?  AOL link: <a href=http://www.bushcheneytransition.com/>Bush + 
Cheney Transition</a>

We have made the decision to accept contributions only from
individuals.  No corporate or political action committee
contributions will be accepted.  Contributions may not exceed
$5,000 per person or $10,000 per couple, and all contributors, in
compliance with Governor Bush's position of full-disclosure of
financial contributions, will be posted on the transition website
on a real-time basis.  These contributions will not count against
an individual's annual political contribution federal giving
limit of $25,000

The American voters have spoken, and we are moving forward to
establish a government that will unify our country and make the
common principles we share as Americans our first priority.

If you have questions, please contact the Transition Foundation's
finance office at 512-344-3722.  All other transition inquiries
should be directed to our office in McLean, VA at (703) 918-2900.
Your support of the Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition
Foundation is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely,

Donald L. Evans
Board of Directors
Bush-Cheney Presidential Transition Foundation, Inc.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.  Coach 
Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning 
to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.  Fantasy owners should look 
elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.  Griese hasn't played in almost a month.  A 
player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.      

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that 
have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to 
be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.  

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar 
has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards 
and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four 
games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to 
Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.   

 Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them 
going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also 
dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up 
against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much 
as a result.  

 James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the 
Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, 
so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league 
uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three 
man.   

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more 
than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games 
prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by 
being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take 
this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over 
the final two games.  

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win 
over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.   

 Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run 
a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy 
value at this point in the season.   

 Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He 
missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year 
career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't 
start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the 
Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being 
bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in 
your Fantasy season.   

 Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He 
rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was 
walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to 
play next Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 James McKnight , WR DAL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in 
two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback 
situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.   

 R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several 
team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made 
several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a 
October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder 
of the season.  

 Larry Centers , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' 
Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.   

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 12/11/00 
 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, 
allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the 
Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by 
this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of 
injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati 
next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.  

 Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 
carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks 
to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.   

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing 
for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a 
touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm 
is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to 
try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as 
Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.   

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 
346 yards.  Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from 
the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.  If you are one 
of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to 
Fantasy glory.   

 Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this 
week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 
passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the 
starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday 
against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins 
this week.    

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He 
gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.  With his 
performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.   
 

 Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Top Dogs Updated 12/11/00 
 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also 
bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers 
are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team 
when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.  

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.  He 
will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter 
will be up for the task.  He struggled in their first meeting but still 
managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.    

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game 
against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went 
down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving 
Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in 
the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' 
quarterbacks all together.   

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game 
against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven 
carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the 
game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of 
the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy 
value to help you at this important stage of the season.   

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.  Look for 
Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.  He had six catches 
for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.    

 Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three 
opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, 
could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham 
(groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. 
Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should 
hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a 
better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' 
D this week.   

 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Culpepper completed 21-of-33 passes for 221 yards and three touchdowns in a 
losing cause Sunday.  He also added an eight-yard scoring run of his own.  
Although the Vikings struggled as a team Sunday Culpepper will continue to 
help Fantasy owners for the duration of the season.    

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Coach Dick LeBeau was impressed enough with Mitchell's performance on Sunday 
against Tennessee that he named him the starting quarterback next Sunday 
against Jacksonville. The veteran QB was 12-for-26 passing for 131 yards with 
no touchdowns or interceptions, and was sacked four times. Mitchell should 
still be nowhere near your roster during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Brad Daluiso , K NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Daluiso ws good on all three of his field goal attempts on Sunday, 
converting from 38, 40 and 21 yards against Pittsburgh. He has now been 
successful on 12 consecutive attempts dating back to Week Seven against New 
York's next opponent, the Dallas Cowboys. Unless you have one of the league's 
top-notch kickers, starting Daluiso is a solid choice.    

 Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Ismail seemed to be much more in synch with quarterback Trent Dilfer during 
Sunday's game against San Diego. He had six catches for 80 yards and a 
touchdown, a 28-yarder the two call a ""slugo"" (slant and go). Although it 
looked for a bit like Ismail wasn't worth a look during your playoffs, he 
could finally be at the point where he'll give you good numbers. Give him 
consideration next Sunday when he faces Arizona.

business units to get together to discuss strategies and opportunities. We 
encourage you to attend for both days.

The goals of the offsite include:
 a) to discuss strategies and commercial opportunities necessary to meet our 
financial targets for 2000;
 b) to discuss resource requirements and organizational issues;
 and c) to provide an open forum to facilitate discussion and team building 
amongst the businesses.

Each business unit will have one hour to present its strategies and 
opportunities.  Specifically, we are asking the origination groups to 
describe their current strategy, detail the top 5 commercial 
deals/opportuntities for 2000 and to discuss any resource or organizational 
issues facing the unit.  Each trading organization will be asked to give a 
short market overview of their markets, identify three market or trading 
opportunities and discuss any resource or organizational issues facing that 
group.  Please submit your presentations to Kay Chapman no later than April 
28, 2000.  The agenda is quite agressive but we wanted to give everyone an 
opportunity to discuss their business.

",,,
258,"Sorry to hear about this one. 

I have some observations to make from my reading (and re-reading) of the 
account:

1 It looks like the old ""undue influence"" problem again. It seems some 
attempts were made by operations to follow up, but nothing happened. 

We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don't 
have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if 
they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career. And that 
is because twice a year, at the PRC, that can happen. This incident shows 
some of these attributes.

For the operations process to be effective there has to be (and be seen to 
be) little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of 
the operations staff. 

2 Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm 
the basis on which they signed it.

3 Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? Brokerage is in 
the P&L and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage 
is at the agreed rate, they should simply pay the brokerage.

4 Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same 
day. I would not have waited for the traders to do it, but I would want to 
know why it took them so long.

5 Given that these (short) trades were absent from the portfolio during a 
highly volatile period of rising prices, I would wonder about motivation in 
addressing the position during this time. Essentially, if it had been correct 
we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did.

I would pursue explanations to points 2, 4 and 5.

265,"Dear Sally,

I decided that this would be the quickest way to get in touch this afternoon,
as I know you must be very busy after taking yesterday off to be with us, and
also I know you will have many things you would like to do at home tonight.
There is no way to say thanks for the great two days.  You are always so
gracious and generous in every way, time, thought, etc.

I really enjoyed going with you to your office and now I can picture you each
day.  I found it very pleasent to sit at your desk.  Please tell Patti that I
enjoyed meeting her.

Thanks so much for taking me to see the interesting shop, and I will look
forward to going there again and using my generous Mother's Day gift
certificate!!  I am still thinking about the table I saw there-it is not a
lot larger than the table I have, but I like the fact that it is a cabinet.

It was very interesting to see your house and what has been done and what you
plan to do with your furnishings.  I think it will be wonderful and I look
forward to seeimg it all finished.  Keep me posted on what is going on and
what decisions you make.  I really do think you and your family will enjoy
the spacious large room.

I do hope David will have good news about his problem and hope that it can be
easily treated.

I thoroughly enjoyed the recital, and I think Amanda played beautifully.
Please tell her that I am so proud of her with the way she is doing in her
music, with the wonderful gold medal, and also doing so great in her school
work.  I hope she has a great two weeks at camp, and I am sure that you will
send me her camp address.  When you have time we can plan her visit time.

It was fun seeing Meagan, and she was very thoughtful to bring Michael by to
see us.  I mentioned to her that if she just wanted a change of scenery after
she goes to camp we would love for her to come over and visit.

Tyler was so much fun too, and especially now that he really knows who we are
and is comfortable with us.  We better stay strong and well so he can have
some visits with us!

I know I probably have forgotten something, but  the visit with you was
great.  Thanks you for being such a loving, thoughtful, and generous
daughter.  I am very proud of you.

Much love,

Mom

I had Sally blocked off from 11:00 to 1:00 for lunch this Thursday, but we

Access Programmers - the contractors will be managed by the end-users they 
are supporting from now on.  The budget dollars for them are in CC 103849 - 
$50K per month.  Do you want each department to continue paying their 
invoices against these budget dollars in 103849 or through their own cost 
centers ?  Do we transfer budget dollars? Close the cost center?  

Equipment - We have 1 flat screen and several large monitors.  Should we just 
return all equipment to surplus or offer to others?

Space - Will CommodityLogic be moving and assuming the space that will be 
vacated on 3/12?

Fax machine will be disconnected/returned.  Digital Scanner will be surplused.

There are two printers that can be surplused unless someone else (CL?) 
wants/needs them.  TurkeyLegs and Tarzan.  

I currently charge 50% of my time to CL and 50% to my cost center - 103850.  
Should I continue this or charge all my time to CL and close my cost center 
?  Since Marvia is also be redeployed, there is no one else in my cost center.

the Enron stock?  If so we need all twelve months of comparable data as 
applicable.

from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  

I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another 
thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to 
an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of 
tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to 
see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could 
discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  

I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large 
number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied 
up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls

281,"In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" Allowed Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the ""Restricted Top of Stack"" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" All"" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the ""Today's Orders"" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the ""Set"" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the "" Limit Order "" section. In order to do so, right click in the ""Today's Orders "" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window "" Stay On Top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

I quickly wanted to send you my new contact information as well as ask you
about my Cash Balance Plan.  My fifth anniversary with Enron is coming up
this Sunday, December 9.

The Cash Balance Plan vests after five years and I want to make sure that
HR's comments to me regarding the plan are right.  HR (Sheila Walton) told
me last week that I need not to worry about vesting in the plan since we
will officially still be Enron employees as long as we are getting paid
severance.  With the latest information we got this seems to be questionable
now.  HR and Benefits do not seem to know what is going on now; all my
questions remained unanswered when I called them this morning.  Benefits
stated that as long as my termination date was after the 9th of December I
would vest.  HR doesn't seem to know when my official termination date is.
If needed, I have more than 10 days of unused vacation; I could be deemed on
vacation and terminated after the 9th.

I would like to ask you to help me with this matter and try to set my
termination date after December 9, i.e. at the earliest next Monday.  I feel
that the company has left us with absolutely nothing but an extreme lack of
information and loads of unanswered questions. I do not see myself in a
position where I want to give my Cash Balance Plan up.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

The two issues of note.  First, Transwestern was able to make some minor 
changes to the media statement to more clearly show in the statement that 
this release of PCBs was an isolated incident and that all parties are 
diligently incorporating measures to contain and manage this release.  
A copy of the revised media statement is available upon request  from Louie 
or myself. 

Second,   PG&E and Southwest Gas have jointly agreed to conduct immediate 
sampling activities at downstream interconnect locations on the Southwest Gas 
system to determine if the PCB's have spread into parts of their system.  
Results of this sampling will be presented in a meeting tentatively scheduled 
in a couple of weeks.  Transwestern will probably atttend this meeting.

led up to the NOV being issued and results of the meeting which Transwestern

been resolved.  

The calendar year 2000 PCB annual document logs were prepared and submitted

Training was given to the Midland Region over the correct completion and 
submittal of forms used to report natural gas releases  to the TNRCC.  The 
agency has updated and has become more stringent with respect to Regional 
requirements for the reportable releases which are submitted to them.  An

Attached is the PTE analysis for Martin Co. #1 using data provided by Ruth
Jensen.  The PTE for CO is approximately 99.38 tpy.  This is using the AP-42
factors for 4-cycle rich engines operating at less than 90% load.  This PTE
analysis is very close to the Title V limits.  CLose enough to warrant
verification of all parameters.  As you recall AP-42 factors for 4-cycle
rich burns used to be 10 g/hp-hr for equal NOx equal CO operations.  The
AP-42 engine factors were revised in 2000 which resulted in a big increase
in CO emissions.  If you use the current AP-42 factors for 90-105% load, we
bust 100 tpy for CO.

can discuss the issue with the OCD is in the middle of November.  I have 
reviewed the reports and results of the studies conducted by us and them and 
the evidence weighs in our favor.  At your leisure and prior to the November  
OCD meeting,  prepare a memo to file of the resaons and justification based 
upon the report results and data why Eunice is not the bad guy in this and 
why Texaco is.  Gradients,  plume elevations and characteristics of the

evidence, both mine and yours, to force OCD to go afterTexaco and  get us out

Effective Monday, November 20, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pools. This 
notice is revised to include the Ex- Atlanta Southern Group and The Ex-

information that is needed for marketers to determine their regulatory risk
in accepting capacity from KeySpan East and West. KeySpan must provide , in
detail, for all transportation contracts (East and West) the following
information:

 - Max. Daily Quantity
 - Telescoping (Receipt and Delivery Points/ Amounts available at
different delivery points)
 - Rate Schedules
 - Pipeline
 - Start Date
 - End Date
 - Current Rates (Demand, Variable, Fuel %, Surcharges)
 - Any proposed pipeline rate changes that take effect in the next
year (effective Date)
 - Map the gas flow of contracts, if transportation feeds into other
transportation contracts.
 - Identify contracts used for storage W/D or Inj.
 - Identify historical (past 24 months) geographic basis differential
to the NYMEX for each receipt point on the different transportation
contracts

KeySpan should explain the contractual and operational restrictions for not
releasing a slice of the system. The percentage of secondary delivery
capacity needs to be defined and KeySpan should inform marketers of any
preliminary negations for incremental purchases and the pricing terms to
serve the firm market.

the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta. 1-4.  Understand 
these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to

so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA 
approved document.  This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers 
presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net

333,"Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were 
identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch 
facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.

All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the 
Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental 
records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis 
was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a 
sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of 
crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical 
assets which were reviewed. 

Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the 
following:

  Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee 
payments were documented 

  NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks 
were documented 

  Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date

  SARA compliance and reporting had been completed

  SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112

  Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were 
available for review

   There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site 
included in the asset for sale
     (permits for the remediation activity is in place)

  Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were 
documented

Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified 
which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a 
considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based 
upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the 
data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this 
analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch 
has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge 
during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.

Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a 
recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to 
each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the 
past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract 
conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for 
discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have 
occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

   My e-mail was in response to all the ones i've received lately.
   Did i criticize the public displays ? i just said i didn't
understand them.  Whatever floats your boat, G.
   I'd like to further emphasize one point.
   On a INDIVIDUAL basis, Americans are the most compassionate and
good-hearted people i've personally come across  (much more than
the Europeans - i was there, i saw - and much, much more, i hate
to say, than us)  We are all refugees, and all of us have been
helped along the way, if not with $10,000 in cash (lol), but on a
personal level, by kind, compassionate people. The scale of blood
and money donations we are seeing now can never be approached
anywhere else in the world.  And not just in this extreme, tragic
case, this has always been true.  The Marshall Plan, earthquakes
in Turkey, floods in Bangladesh, etc... Americans have always been
there to help, if not in manpower, at least in cash donations. In
the immortal words of you-know-who, Americans are good people.
   However, good people do not patriots make.
   Where were the patriots when, after Pearl Harbor, the
resolution in Congress to enter WWII passed by ONE vote ? Were the
patriots, those people who lined up the streets of Washington and
claimed that F.D.R. was a warmonger, a traitor, and a Jew-lover ?
   Were they patriots, those young men and women (""the flower of
America's youth"") who insulted and spat at the Vietnam Veterans
who returned home ? Let us not argue the merits of the (illegal)
war in VN. But shouldn't patriots at the very least show support
for their troops ?
   Were they patriots, those companies which, during the height of
the Iran hostage crisis, tried to deal with the enemy and make a
profit ? (Marc Rich was not an isolated case)
   In the next few weeks, will people try to dump their stocks in
the hope of making a killing or cutting their losses ?  (Greyhound
stocks anyone ?)  Continenetal has already laid off 12,000 people,
couldn't they have waited, and don't you believe they wanted to
make the cuts all along but jumped on the opportunity ?
   America at its heart is a nation of self-interest - money.
It goes to war in the name of that self-interest, not in the name
of IDEALS (the Gulf War was meant to defend and save the poor,
little Kuwaitis...rite...)  That self-interest makes America rich
and strong - and all the more power to them, we all want to be
rich and strong.  The question is, will its people die for it?
   Hopefully, we'll never find out - no one wants a fukkin' war.
I just wonder (WONDER, not question, criticize, or judge) if the
same Joe Smith who is screaming for war rite now on CNN, in a few
months' time, after the grief and justifiable anger have died
down, will he be so willing then to drop everything and go to war,
HIMSELF, on the GROUND in Pakistan or Afghanistan.  Once more,
Buddha saves us, we'll never find out.

PS
   I claim that if i win the $10,000,000 Lotto jackpot, i will
donate half of it to chairty. With my TRACK RECORD, would you
wonder my resolve ?  How dare you ?  Joe Smith does have a track
record too.

Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.  Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology.  

On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods.  

We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.

If you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641).

In U.S. East spot markets, northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp prices declined just over a percent while hardwood spot transactions took a larger fall since July 2. Traders said that although some suppliers had pulled out of spot business, availability of various grades was still plentiful.
Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest dipped $5/tonne to $420-$450/tonne, or 13 percent below July contract prices, paperloop sources said. Southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK) on the spot market also fell, down $5/tonne to $400-$430/tonne.
""Prices are still eroding in the States (because) a lot of spot is still available, it's all over the place,"" said a supplier source. But he added that spot prices had eroded so badly in Asian markets that he pulled out altogether. Previously, some suppliers had diverted tonnage to Asian markets because of stronger demand for hardwoods there.
Both hardwood grades fell in the U.S. by $10/tonne on oversupply as producers tried to edge down their inventories. Northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK) closed the week about 18 percent below July contract prices at $340-380/tonne. Southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) also ended at $340-380/tonne, but the lower end prices were partly keyed by low freight costs. One source noted that in the Northeast some buys were in ""the low 300s.""

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

418,"While you may have read in the Change Control email sent today from the ETS Solution Center, we have some changes on the 41st floor scheduled for this weekend during the maintenance window.  While we do not expect any problems with this maintenance window, we need to make sure we have a plan in place to not impact the customers. 

This Saturday night,  October 27, starting at 10:30 pm fiber maintenance will be performed in the wiring closet on EB41.  During this maintenance window the jacket that covers and protects the fiber will be pulled back tight and secured.  This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet with the server room on 41, where the TMS servers are located.   While we do not expect this maintenance to have any impact, if we do have any issues with the fiber it can be replaced within an estimated 2 hour window.  Outage impact would then be lose of connectivity with the Enron LAN from that server room, therefore TMS would be unavailable.  

At 10:30 pm on Saturday night, Mark Cowley from the server team will contact the HotTap Helpdesk to get approval to start the maintenance window.  The maintenance window will not begin until all processing for the pipelines is complete.  If we have any problems or issues he will contact me and I will start the escalation process.    

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.   Thanks.  Jean x51615

423,"Attached is the revised version of the Plant/Field Draft 1 sent to you on 
Nov. 9, 2000. Draft 1 should have been adopted with customization prior to 
Nov. 14, 2000 to be Grandfathered under the requirements of OSHA's final rule 
1910.900 (c). The revised attachment revises Draft 1, changing what is 
necessary for a prior written program to continue to be Grandfathered. 
Because we would not have had the final rule prior to Nov. 14, OSHA gives us 
until Jan. 16, 2001 to amend a prior written program and bring it in line 
with the requirements of 1910.900 (c). That is what this revision does. 

Some items are marked ""optional"" and are just that. Removing any other part 
of the text should only be done after you are satisfied doing so does not 
leave you short of meeting the requirements of 1910.900 (c).

424,"Frank,

I just completed a phone conversation with Mr. Jeffrey M. Tanenbaum, Council 
with Littler Mendelson, that you retained to review our ergonomics written 
programs and plan for Grandfathering Enron companies. Mr. Tanenbaum appears 
to be an excellent choice for this assignment due to his being full time in 
the area of OSHA compliance and his business reputation. 

I explained in full Enron's position with respect to the existence of written 
ergo program procedures as of November 14, 2000 and my actions and plan to 
obtain Grandfathering status by January 16, 2001. Mr. Tanenbaum stated he 
finds no problem with the plan to achieve this status. He indicated that his 
review of the programs should stand for the evaluation of the program 
elements, and agreed that the OSHA 200 Log review would cover the remainder 
of the evaluation requirement, but suggested this be done under Attorney 
Client privilege with him. 

He has some minor, to use his words, rework of the programs he will be 
forwarding to us. These revisions will need to be integrated into the written 
programs before January 16, 2001.

I most appreciate your attention to this matter and the timeliness in 
obtaining us a review of our action plan and programs.

	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                Primary
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                                
                                Alternate
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
""RIMS"" link, select ""Docket#"" and follow the instructions  (call
202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be
filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR
385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under
the ""e-Filing"" link.

432,"Shelley,

By tomorrow morning I am pretty sure I can have the period Aug 2000 through Jul 2001 Cash In/Out reconciled (roughly) with the PNR and the large PPAs accounted for for each month.  

Attached is what I have summarized so far.  Please go to the last worksheet tab called ""SummaryCashInOutStats"".  I have also finished summarizing within each month the total Cash Out qty and the total Cash In qty and priced each at the appropriate cash in/out price.  Since the imbalance quantities are broken out, the actual cash settlement per customer will vary some from actual as the cash in/out mechanism nets the quantities by customer first before applying a cash in/out rate to that customer.  

Thx, Jim

Shelley asked me to pass along representative revenue data for a NNG north-end power plant and a south-end power plant.  We chose the Great River Energy/Pleasant Valley #1 Power Plant in Minnesota and the West Texas Utilities/San Angelo Power Plant in Texas.  The total 2001 transportation revenues generated from these power plants are approximately $1,050,000 for Pleasant Valley #1 and $129,000 for San Angelo.  

I have attached two Microsoft Word excel spreadsheets to support the revenues generated from these two examples.

454,"I will be out of the office Monday & Tuesday, February 25 & 26th.",,,
455,"Currently, we are researching ways to enhance our Internet services to you and making our FERC
archives searchable and would like your feedback  Would this service be of interest to you and what  features or functions would best serve you? 

After our previous e-mail we had several questions concerning upgrading to the new Real One player. 

  1.  Do you have to upgrade to the new Real One player to view FERC our programming? 

  No, you can still use Real Player. We suggested that you upgrade because of the new features Real   One offers making it easier to view the agenda while playing the archive.  When using a previous  version of Real you just have to go back and forth between the two windows (browser & player) to see the agenda.    The new player just makes it easier and more convenient for you to view the agenda and video in one window. 

  2.  When I go to download the Real One they want my credit card number.  How do I get the Free
  Real One Player? 

Unfortunately, Real does not make finding the Real One Free player easy.  When you go to the web page (www.real.com <http://www.real.com/>) go about half way down and on a gray bar going across the page you will see  ""Our Free Player"", click that link and you will be taken to another page.  On the new page look in the lower right hand corner toward the bottom of page and you will see a link ""Download the Free RealOne Player Only"".  You will then need to fill out their paperwork (choose the option that you are a new user) and register but will not be charged.

Energy Consumers and Producers? 

Are you a consumer that hesitated to buy forward in 2000 or bought too soon last year?  Are you a producer who hedged too early in 2000 and did not hedge enough in early 2001?  Did you take undue credit risk because you did not know how to estimate exposure?  Are you comforting yourself with the fact that you did not hedge to make money?  Let's face it - you did not hedge to lose money either.  Kase's Derivatives for Energy Professionals will provide you with the indispensable strategies and tactics you need to avoid costly errors and equip you to make the important hedging decisions necessary for survival in today's treacherous marketplace.

The market took very close to the 1550 schedule.

We shifted extra linepack East of Station 13 prior to the scheduled downtime.

In the middle of the night last night it became apparent that station 13 was not going to come back on-line -- vibration problems.

Allan Weatherford has another crew coming in who may have another idea for resolving the problem. He will notify Rick Craig first thing this morning.

If you see Rob or Bob you may want to mention this problem at 13 to them -- sometimes they call in.  Previously we had this same problem at station 13 because the station was incorrectly designed with too much pipe unsupported above ground.

The weather forecast shows mild weather, and we can continue to meet a 1550 market demand with station 13 down.",Allan Weatherford Rick Craig Rob Bob,,

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

USA: UPDATE 1-Calif. bankruptcy ripples through utilities shares.

04/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Shares of utilities companies paused, plummeted 
then pared losses after news on Friday that Pacific Gas & Electric, 
California's largest investor-owned utility, filed for voluntary bankruptcy, 
a victim the state's flawed deregulation law. 
Trade in shares of parent company PG&E Corp. were halted before the filing. 
When trading resumed, they fell 37.96 percent to $7.06, off $4.32, below its 
modern stock low of $8.50.
Shares in Edison International , California's other financially strapped 
utility, lost almost 30 percent of its value to trade down $3.72 at $8.92. 
Stocks of wholesale power suppliers with money owed to them at risk as a 
result of the California power crisis also fell sharply on the news but 
recovered slightly in later trade. 
""California is a problem that's going to be with us for quite some time, but 
these guys are going to benefit from the fact that rates were increased there 
recently and going forward they will benefit from power prices that are high 
relative to historical norms and eventually they are going to get paid on 
some of these receivables as well,"" said Dain Rauscher Wessels analyst Mark 
Easterbrook. 
Easterbrook said Duke Energy Corp. , Dynegy Corp. , Reliant Energy Inc. and 
Williams Cos. Inc. each had outstanding amounts of $100 million or more owing 
to them as a result of the California power crisis, including a significant 
but as yet unquantified portions owed by Pacific Gas & Electric. 
Duke was down 4.74 percent or $2.01 at 40.39 while Dynegy was off $2.27 or 
4.46 percent to 48.65, up from its low of $46.35. 
""The market has taken than $1 billion - more than threefold - off Dynegy's 
market capitalization even though its exposure to reserves is $265 million,"" 
said James Yanello, analyst at UBS Warburg. 
Williams Cos. was down 96 cents or 2.32 percent lower at $40.89 but off its 
low of $39.60. 
""Enron, Williams and El Paso's exposure is very limited."" said Yanello. 
Enron Corp. shares were down 2.6 percent or $1.45 at $54.25, off its low of 
$53.20. 
""It's unfortunate that the state's largest utility was forced to turn to the 
court for a resolution. Solutions to the state's energy crisis have been 
available for months that would have avoided this scenario, but Governor 
Davis and the legislature lack the bold leadership to take swift, decisive 
action,"" spokesman Vance Meyer said. 
El Paso shares moved off its intraday low of $63.03 to trade up 7 cents at 
$63.10. 
Reliant Energy edged back up to $43.51 or down 4.06 percent or $1.84 after 
hitting an intraday low of $42.65. (-Janet McGurty, New York Equities, +1 212

In 1st Hearing, PUC Urged to Lift Rate Hike 


Energy: Speakers call on the agency to rescind the increase approved last 
month. Officials caution that they are focusing on ""who pays and how much."" 

By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer 

The lights were out to save energy in a Santa Monica hearing room, but the 
heat was on as consumers and business representatives urged the California 
Public Utilities Commission on Monday to spread the pain of rate increases 
fairly--but differed substantially on how that could be accomplished.

Many of the more than 30 speakers who appeared at the PUC's first public 
hearing on how to design new electricity rates spent their time trying to 
persuade the commission to undo the increase of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, 
which was approved March 27 and is expected to begin appearing on bills in 
June.

Although Commissioner Henry Duque and Administrative Law Judge Victor Ryerson 
listened politely and court reporters took down every word, those fervent 
pleas were largely wasted.

Ryerson admonished the audience of about 75 people that the hearing would not 
determine whether rate increases are necessary to pay for soaring electricity 
costs. That already has been decided by the PUC, he said.

Rather, the series of hearings this week throughout the state, each attended 
by one of the five PUC commissioners, will focus on ""who pays and how much,"" 
Ryerson said.

That wasn't what consumer advocate Douglas Heller wanted to hear.

""The PUC is asking the wrong questions,"" said Heller of the Foundation for 
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""The question that the PUC 
should be asking is: How do we get our state back?""

""Small consumers never asked for deregulation and never benefited from it,"" 
Heller said. ""The innocent victims of this public policy nightmare should not 
bear the burden of the energy industry's greed and the governor's failure to 
confront it.""

About 20 different rate plans have been submitted to the PUC, which is 
expected to adopt a rate design at its meeting next Monday. PUC officials 
said that rates will rise by an average of 30% but that some customers will 
see no increases while some will see much larger increases.

The commission is under tremendous pressure to devise a new rate structure 
that encourages conservation but doesn't damage businesses--and to do it in 
six weeks rather than the usual six months or longer.

Some who testified Monday in Santa Monica feared that the new rates will 
cause families to subsidize single users and will penalize those that are 
already conserving electricity.
 
David Marshall, chief financial officer of El Monte-based Gregg Industries, 
asked that the PUC retain lower rates for the hours when electricity use is 
lower.
 
Gregg, which employs 400 people to make heavy iron parts for industry, has 
shifted all its production to between midnight and noon, he said. That is the 
only way Gregg can continue to compete, Marshall said.
 
His company does business in the United States, Mexico, Europe and Asia, ""and 
in every one of those markets we have direct competitors anxious to take 
business away from us,"" Marshall said. ""California is not an island.""
 
Encino resident Donald Tollefson argued that consumers should be spared the 
brunt of the rate increases because they will be forced to pay twice: for 
their own higher electricity rates and in the form of price increases as 
businesses pass along their higher energy costs.
 
""Whatever you do,"" he said, ""you should be fair and compassionate.""
 
About 200 people attended a similar hearing in a dimly lit high school 
auditorium in Rosemead.
 
Bob Wellemin, an air-conditioner mechanic from Temple City, said the 
commission should take the blame for not pushing to build more power plants.
 
""How on Earth have you been representing the consumers?"" he said, evoking 
applause. ""And what I don't understand is that we have three or four meetings 
like this ahead. And we got a May 14 deadline to make a decision. I don't 
want to sound skeptical. But how can I not be skeptical when you've got one 
representative here and a week to decide.""
 
Wellemin also criticized the commission's proposed rate increases, saying 
that it would hurt people who already conserve energy. As a resident with 
low-energy appliances and no central air-conditioning, he said he would be 
penalized because it would be difficult to reduce his power from one month to 
the next.
Others warned the commission to take a methodical approach in deciding the 
rate plan.
 
""If I have to act businesslike, I would expect state representatives to act 
the same,"" said Don Osborn, a small business owner from the San Gabriel 
Valley. ""I haven't seen that.""

Enron's Lay Calls for Open Access to Transmission Grid: Comment
2001-05-08 18:01 (New York)


     Washington, May 8 (Bloomberg) -- Comments by Ken Lay,
chairman of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, on his belief
that generators should have easier access to the U.S. power grid.
Lay spoke after receiving the U.S. Energy Association's 2001 U.S.
Energy Award.

     ``Today we don't have open access to the transmission grid,''
Lay said. ``We could get 2 to 3 percent more power into the West
if we had open access.''
     Lay said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should open
up the power grid throughout the U.S., so generators no longer
have to pay a series of separate fees to move electricity from one
region to another.
     ``We clearly need non-discriminatory open access on the
grid,'' he said, adding that the FERC has the authority to open up
the power grid in the same way that natural gas pipeline
transmissions work.
     ``It's clear we've under-invested in energy infrastructure in
the last 10 to 15 years,'' Lay said. ``It's going to take a few
years to correct that.''

     Lay spoke a day after 96,000 electricity customers in
California suffered hour-long blackouts as high temperatures
boosted demand for power. It was the fifth day of electricity
cutoffs in California this year and more are expected.

? California Budget Resolved
? FERC Ordered Energy Settlements Stall MOU/Plan B 

BUDGET
California legislators in the House have once again established a tentative 
reserve amount for the state's depleted budget.  Both sides are reportedly 
uneasy with the $2.74B compromise and sources indicate that the four 
Republican votes needed to pass the budget  in the Assembly are likely far 
more obtainable than the one Republican vote needed in the Senate.  
California's current redistricting process may provide Republicans with 
future seats that could translate into immediate bargaining power in energy 
and budget matters.  Adding to the frustration, sources indicate that 
consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield plans to pressure State  Treasurer 
Angelides into battling with legislators for progress on the budget and 
revenue bonds.

ENERGY SETTLEMENTS
Today marked opening negotiations for California state energy officials and 
the several large energy providers who are charged with price gouging 
Californians.  Sources close to California State Sen. Burton report that the 
results from the15 days of negotiations before the FERC appointed 
Administrative Law Judge, Curtis Wagener, will significantly influence the 
state's efforts in promoting any Plan B or MOU.  Burton indicated that FERC 
would need to order between $3 and $4B in generator refunds before the state 
would finalize a SoCal bail-out.  Of that amount, SoCal would most likely be 
infused with $1B, however, without substantial contributions from power 
providers that sold into California and currently fall outside FERC's 
jurisdiction (i.e. BC Hydro & LA DWP), a $3 to $5B refund would be impossible 
to achieve.  Regardless of legislators' desires, sources believe that  
consistent with the PG&E bankruptcy advisor's view, a multibillion dollar 
refund from FERC is unlikely.  Sources will continue to monitor and report on 
these negotiations.      ",Harvey Rosenfield Burton Curtis Wagener,2.74B between $3 and $4B 1B $3 to $5B multibillion dollar,FERC House Assembly Senate State SoCal BC Hydro & LA DWP PG&E

=20
the FERC=01,s response to them. The following is a summary of the remarks o=
f=20
the  four Commissioners and the major points of what has been ordered:=20
?
Major features
?
1.? Proposes to replace ISO and PX boards with independent,  non-stakeholde=
r=20
boards.

2.? Continued significant role for the presidents of PX/ISO, who  should be=
=20
made voting members.

3.? Elimination of mandated buy-sell requirement for the IOUs  (although no=
=20
explanation as to whether this requires CPUC action). Over-reliance  on spo=
t=20
markets has been problematical.

4.? As an independent exchange, the PX will be free to design the  products=
=20
desired by the market.

5.? The proposed price modification measure will be a temporary  measure.=
=20
Single price for all offers below $150. However, no bid above $150 will  se=
t=20
the price for all generators. A seller can bid anything it wants. Allowing =
=20
generators to receive their as-bid price will allow high-cost generators to=
 =20
participate in the market. However, the generator will be required to=20
provide  confidential reports to FERC explaining the necessity for bids ove=
r=20
$150 through  12/31/02.

6.? The order requires forward scheduling of 95% of an scheduling =20
coordinator=01,s schedule, with a penalty applied for deviations which exce=
ed 5%=20
As  an incentive, the proceeds of the penalties go to the schedulers who=20
comply with  the tolerance band.

7.? Rejects the purchase price caps proposed by the ISO. The order  would=
=20
eliminate the ISO=01,s price cap authority.

8.? Beginning 1/1/01, the prospect of refunds will be available. =20
?
Commissioner Hebert
?
Due to a technical problem when I called in, I heard only part of his =20
remarks. He announced that he will have a separate concurrence in the order=
,=20
but  is troubled by some of its features. The $150 cap is questionable,=20
whether  described as a ""Soft cap"" or as a ""hard cap.""
His concern is that it will  clearly discourage new investment in generatio=
n.=20
He therefore recommended that  the $150 cap should be escalated on a regula=
r=20
basis (perhaps every six months)  until it reaches at least $250.=20
?
He points out that the ISO and PX are required to make RTO filings to FERC =
=20
on 1/16/01. These filings should address the major aspects of the Order=20
issued  today.=20
?
Hebert also questioned the issue of refunds, alleging that it was =20
""disingenuous"" to suggests that refunds were a possible remedy.=20
?
Commissioner Breathitt=20
?
Breathitt announced almost all of the foregoing major points of the  orderT=
he=20
order is based on a market approach. ""In choosing our market-based  approac=
h,=20
it is our goal to guide the markets to self-correct and not  re-institute=
=20
command and control regulation.? ""We have all worked too hard,  too long, t=
o=20
have this result.""
?
Commissioner Massey
?
Sixty-five years ago, the Congress decreed that prices had to be just and =
=20
reasonable.? There is no exception for market-based approaches. He will =20
concur, as the order does find that prices have been unjust and=20
unreasonable.  The order does insure that prices should return to being jus=
t=20
and reasonable.  Cited Frank Wolak as proposing there ought to be an 18-24=
=20
month forward product  designed which the CPUC will years ago federal law=
=20
dictated that prices had to  be just and reasonable.

The $150 is a ""soft cap"" and allows a generator to bid above it, but if  it=
=20
does, it will not set the price which other generators receive. He invites =
=20
comments on this issue.=20

With regard to retroactive refunds, the Office of the General Counsel  has=
=20
prepared a legal memorandum which concludes that the FERC probably does not=
 =20
have authority to order refunds retroactively for any date before October 2=
, =20
2000. Invites comments on this issue.=20
California needs new generation and  transmission and the siting authority=
=20
belongs to the state. California must do  its part to ensure that customers=
=20
do, in fact, benefit from competitive markets  that ensure just and=20
reasonable prices.=20
He is not yet confident that the  Commission has taken all necessary steps.=
=20
?
Chairman Hoecker
?
He strongly supports the order.=20

Comments are due in three weeks. This is no time to pull punches. He  cited=
=20
the San Diego hearings as indicating that California markets were,?  ""out o=
f=20
synch with the needs of the digital economy.""? For FERC regulators  who are=
=20
used to corporate struggles among utilities and other large companies,  ""th=
is=20

Average citizens had no warning this was going to happen and they had  no=
=20
competitive alternatives. It was unfair to them and, ""there is plenty of =
=20
responsibility for this meltdown to go around.""=20

""If I was a senior citizen in San Diego living on a fixed income, or a  sma=
ll=20
business owner living on a small profit margin, or a school administrator =
=20
dealing with a tight budget, the doubling of my bill would make me want my=
=20
money  back, or to at least ensure that this won=01,t happen again in the=
=20
future.""
Many  who expected this order, expected ""a lynching and the transfer of lar=
ge=20
amounts  of money. They want us to round up the bad guys who manipulated th=
e=20

We are not ignoring actual or undue discrimination or actual abuses of =20
market power. The order makes better market monitoring going forward a =20
fundamental part of FERC=01,s proposal.? If evidence of such behavior is =
=20
brought forward, FERC will act on that information. ""However, we can=01,t d=
elay =20

Hoecker believes that, ""strong federal action is both warranted and =20
important at this moment.""? ""The bulk power grid must be made to work =20
efficiently across the entire West.""=20

""Competition is at risk, make no mistake about that. In view of the =20
California experience, several states are reconsidering or shelving plans t=
o =20

 =20
returning to the old days of vertically-integrated utilities.? ""The =20
California experience has been instructive, but not helpful=01(to the=20
meandering  implementation of competition throughout the nation.""=20

LOUISIANA
PSC discusses creating a 'pool' of CLECs

The Public Service Commission yesterday discussed a staff report on
creating a ""pool"" of competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) to
provide service to CLEC customers whose providers are unable to pay
their debts to incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs).  The pool aims
to enable CLEC customers to continue receiving reliable service without
having their business revert to ILECs such as BellSouth
Telecommunications, Inc.

The commission took no action on the issue at yesterday's session but
plans to discuss it again next month, a commission staff member told
TR.  Meanwhile, the state's CLECs are addressing the issue at a meeting
today in Baton Rouge, the staff member said.



SECTION 251/252
KANSAS
Arbitrators say SW Bell doesn't have to combine UNEs for Sprint

Two state Corporation Commission arbitrators have determined that the
law doesn't require Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. to combine unbundled
network elements (UNEs) at the request of Sprint Communications Co. L.P.
that aren't combined already.  Originally the arbitrators ruled that SW
Bell had to provide Sprint UNE combinations that SW Bell ordinarily
provides to itself when provisioning telecom services for its customers.

The arbitrators said they based their reversal on a U.S. District Court
for the Western District of Michigan (Grand Rapids) decision, which
stated, ""Under the [federal Telecommunications Act of 1996] it is the
duty of the requesting carriers, not the incumbent [local exchange
carriers], to combine the elements.""  The court explained that it
couldn't insert a bundling requirement and added that the state also was
precluded from imposing such a requirement.

The ruling will be sent to the KCC for action.  The arbitrator's ruling
is available at
http://www.kcc.state.ks.us/scan/200101/20010119165748.pdf.  (Docket no.
00-SCCC-1046-ARB)



UNIVERSAL SERVICE
KANSAS
KCC to take a look at how USF dollars are spent

The state Corporation Commission has determined that it needs to monitor
how nonrural and rural telecom carriers are using the universal service
funds they receive from the state and federal governments.  Carriers
must use the funds ""only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading
of facilities and services,"" according to section 254(e) of the federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996.

Parties must file comments by March 9 detailing any mechanisms the KCC
can use to monitor whether the support is being used appropriately.
Replies are due March 30.  (Docket no. O1-GIMT-595-GIT, In the Matter of
a General Investigation to Ensure Compliance with Section 254(e) of the
federal Telecommunications Act of 1996)



INTERNET
MISSOURI
Sen. Kinder aims to enact UETA

Sen. Peter D. Kinder (R., District 27) has introduced SB 220 to make
electronic transactions as legally binding as paper transactions if the
parties involved agree to conduct business electronically.  SB 220 also
would repeal the Missouri Digital Signatures Act.

Certain types of transactions still would have to occur manually.  The
proposed bill, for example, wouldn't supersede laws that govern the
creation and execution of certain types of documents, such as wills,
codicils, or testamentary trusts.

It has been referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce and
Environment.



CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
NEW YORK
Legislators wants rate disclosure and per-second billing

Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer (D., District 67) has introduced two bills
to modify telecom pricing practices.

AB 1968 would require long distance service providers that use access
codes to disclose their rates.  The carriers would have to provide
intrastate and interstate rates and ""the effect of such variables as
time of day and call duration"" each time a caller uses the access code.
The companies also would have to provide the rate information to local
exchange carriers, who would have to share the information with their
customers semiannually.

The second measure, AB 1668, would require all charges based on call
duration to be charged and prorated by the second.  The proposed law
would apply to charges for both landline and wireless calls and all
service providers and ""aggregators,"" such as hotels and hospitals.

Both bills have been referred to the Committee on Corporations
Authorities and Commissions.  The text of AB 1968 is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01968, and the
text of AB 1668 is available at
http://assembly.state.ny.us/cgi-bin/showtext?billnum=A01668.



INTERNET
ILLINOIS
Legislation would tax Internet sales

Rep. John (Jack) McGuire (D., Joliet) has filed HB 278 to subject
Internet purchases shipped to Illinois addresses to the state's sales
tax.  The measure was filed yesterday and hasn't been formally
introduced in the House yet.

INTERNET
OKLAHOMA
Bill allows state agencies to adopt digital signature rules

Rep. Fred Perry (R., District 69) has prefiled HB 1322 to allow state
agencies to adopt their own rules governing the use of digital
signatures.  The rules would have to meet or exceed the rules adopted by
the Secretary of State.  The bill wouldn't require any person to use or
permit the use of electronic or digital signatures.

HB 1322 would set up certain requirements for citizens to become
certification authorities in Oklahoma.  The applicant would need to
register with the Secretary of State and pay a filing fee.
Additionally, the applicant would need to provide the Secretary of State
a bond, certificate of insurance, or other evidence of financial
security in the amount of $100,000.



CUSTOMER-AFFECTING -- SERVICE QUALITY
UTAH
PSC seeks comments on service quality rules

The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by Jan. 29 on
proposed service quality rules, most of which would apply only to Qwest
Corp.  (1/11/01 p.m.)  The rules would require Qwest to install 90% of
all new, transfer, and change orders within three business days or on
the customer's requested due date.  Beginning in July, the company would
have to install 95%.

The draft rules also would allow Qwest to have a maximum of five held
orders per 1,000 new, transfer, and change orders at the end of any
month.  Beginning Jan. 1, 2002, the company could have only four such
held orders.  If it missed an installation commitment, residential
customers would receive a $10 credit, and small business customers would
receive a $40 credit.

Qwest would have to repair 80% of all out-of-service troubles within one
business day and repair 85% of them starting in July.  It would have to
repair 90% within two business days.  If Qwest missed a repair
commitment, it would have to credit residential customers $10 and
business customers $40.

The proposed rules also address reporting requirements, billing, and
disconnection.  The rules are scheduled to be submitted to
Administrative Rules for publication Jan. 31. (Docket no. 00-R340-01, In
the Matter of a Proceeding to Adopt Rules Governing Service Quality
Standards to End Users for All Tariffed Public Telecommunications
Services Pursuant to UCA 54-8b-3.3 (6)(a))



TAXATION
MISSOURI
Bill would exempt some interstate telecom services from sales taxes

Sen. Harry Wiggins (D., District 10) has introduced SB 234 to extend an
existing sales tax exemption on certain types of telecom services.  The
measure would extend the state's current exemption to include services
that are separately listed ""on records of the seller maintained in the
ordinary course of business.""  The existing exemption applies only to
services that are listed separately on the customer's bill.

SB 234 also would modify the list of nontaxable telecom services by
adding ""interstate transmissions of information by wire, radio, optical
cable, coaxial cable, electronic impulses, or other similar means.""

SB 234 has been referred to the Senate Ways and Means Committee.

VIRGINIA
Verizon requests collocation exemptions

The State Corporation Commission has asked for comment on Verizon
Virginia, Inc.'s request for two collocation exemptions.  Verizon said
its Mason Cove and Hartwood central offices qualify for exemptions of
the general requirement to provide physical collocation.

The commission ordered its staff to investigate the request and report
its findings by March 19.  Comments from interested parties are due Feb.
19.  (Case no. PUC010006, Application of Verizon Virginia, Inc. for
Exemption for Physical Collocation at its Mason Grove and Hartwood

MINNESOTA
Rural carriers say governor's plan will lead to higher rates

The Minnesota Association for Rural Telecommunications has opposed Gov.
Jesse Ventura's (Independence Party, Minnesota) proposed telecom
legislation, saying it would bring drastically higher rates and stall
technological advancements.  The governor unveiled the plan during the
Jan. 23 presentation of his proposed 2002-2003 budget.  (1/24/00 p.m.)

The group, which says it represents the state's independent rural
telcos, says the governor's plan to reduce access charges would give
long distance companies a ""windfall"" in reduced costs without passing it
on to rural customers.  It said independent telephone companies use
access charges to keep basic telephone rates affordable, deploy advanced
technology, and reinvest in their communities.

According to the association, the governor's proposal ""is built on the
false premise that independent telephone companies are not supplying
rural Minnesota with the most advanced technology.  The fact is by the
end of this year, all customers of independent telephone companies will
have access to [digital subscriber line] service, the same as the Twin
Cities.""

the SCC could hold a hearing if one were requested.

The measure has been referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce and

530,"CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT MATERIAL
PER CPUC RULE 51

ALL PARTIES:

In light of the ongoing energy crisis affecting both gas and electric
operations in California, PG&E has decided to cancel the Gas Accord II
informational workshop previously scheduled for this Wednesday, February 7.


We are sorry for this late notice of cancellation, but we hope you will
understand that everyone involved is dealing with a difficult and fluid
situation.

As you know, we originally had concluded, based on feedback from many
parties, that it would be beneficial to hold an informational workshop here
in early February, in order to explain more fully the comprehensive
Settlement Offer PG&E circulated to all ""Rule 51 Parties"" in December 2000.

Unfortunately, however, the crisis situation has overtaken us, and so we are
canceling the February 7 informational workshop.

PG&E also will not be holding the previously-planned series of negotiation
sessions, the first of which was scheduled to occur on February 21-22.

Instead, PG&E will focus its efforts on resolving the crisis issues, and
working towards a formal Gas Accord II Application with the California
Public Utilities Commission, hopefully by June 1 of this year.

We are keenly aware that the current energy crisis necessarily requires
priority attention.  By the same token, we also are aware that it will be
incumbent upon PG&E to file some form of Gas Accord II proposal with the
Commission in the near future, so that the Commission has the time and the
opportunity to consider fully all of the many issues that will arise upon
expiration of the current Gas Accord at the end of 2002.

PG&E continues to encourage individual Parties to stay in touch with PG&E in
the weeks and months ahead.  We hope to be able to respond to any questions
you might have regarding the December 2000 comprehensive Settlement
Proposal, and we also would welcome your continued feedback on issues of
concern to you.

Please feel free to e-mail or call us, or your other PG&E contacts, if you
have questions or concerns

537,"Jeff and Jim --

I have done some research into the issue of whether the CPUC would be able
to restate the UDC's PX Energy Charges (and thus PX Credits) back to October
if the FERC were to apply its mitigation plan back that far. Thus far, my
research indicates that the answer is yes (or at least there is a strong
argument that the answer is yes) and it would not violate the rule against
retroactive rate making.  The reasoning is as follows:

The Commission (as affirmed by the courts) have ruled that they may subject
a utility's rates to refund to account for adjustments made pursuant to a
methodology or formula adopted before the date the utility's rates became
subject to refund. Thus any ratemaking is considered prospective because the
formulas are in place before the utility's rates are made subject to refund.
The PX Energy Charge is calculated pursuant to the formula/mechanism set
forth in the utility's tariffs.  These charges were always subject to
adjustment on a prospective basis due to the settlement process.  The change
in energy prices which would be effected by the FERC ruling could very well
be viewed as an adjustment made pursuant to a formula.  Thus the change
would not be considered retroactive ratemaking.

I had a chance to talk with Mike Day for a couple of minutes about this
issue.  He concurred with my analysis.

4. Does the Commission's existing practice for authorizing new CLECs create a

those disparities be eliminated or reduced?

study prepared by Hildebrandt of the CAISO. It was apparently released on the

Note that the $9billion includes bilateral trade sold to any party.  However, 
Hildebrandt cannot say who the supplier is unless DWR, CAISO, or the PX was 
the buyer (for those buyers he presumably has detailed data).  Thus, he can 
ascribe overcharges to specific jurisdictional generators for only $5.4 
billion of the $9billion total.  He does not show what specific parties are 
attrributable to the $5.4 billion.   In an earlier study on just ISO R/T 
""strategic bidding"", supplier names were released inadvertantly by CAISO.

Finally, as in previous CAISO studies, a significant fraction of overcharges 
(approx $3 billion)  comes from before the refund-effective date of 10/1/00.

Montana 's power crisis may be more intense thanCalifornia's 

By JIM ROBBINS
New York Times

BUTTE, Mont. - The last large-scale metal mine is silent in this city that 
sits astride the Rocky Mountains. 
The 170-ton, house-sized ore-hauling trucks, which once rumbled with loads 24 
hours a day, have not fired up their engines since last summer. Nor have the 
conveyors, the crushers, the concentrators and the grinders. And most of the 
320 workers who carved out a living extracting copper, molybdenum and silver 
from the 600-foot deep Continental Pit have scattered to other states and 
other jobs. 
Montana Resources, which owns the mine, has been out of affordable power for 
nine months. At the beginning of 2000, the mine was paying $26 a megawatt 
hour, up from $19 the year before. Last week, however, a megawatt hour cost 
$320. 
While California has grabbed most of the national headlines for a power 
crisis caused by deregulation gone awry - rolling blackouts resumed there 
last week - another power deregulation crisis has been unfolding here in 
Montana . And in some ways, it is far more striking in its impact. While 
Californians may be somewhat protected from skyrocketing costs, Montanans are 
not. Paper companies, mines and other large industrial companies in Montana 
have been laying off workers because they cannot afford to pay their electric 
bills. Residents are expecting their household electric costs to as much as 
double by July 2002. 
A growing number of Montanans want to roll back the clock to a time when 
their state, blessed with its own sources of cheaply produced power, had some 
of the lowest electricity rates in the country. Many residents are directing 
their anger at the Legislature, which in their view deregulated the market 
for electrical power solely at the behest of the Montana Power Co., once the 
state's dominant utility. 
Under deregulation that took effect three years ago, Montana Power sold its 
hydroelectric and coal-fired generating plants to PPL Corp., the Allentown, 
Pa., company that sells power in 42 states and in Canada, Great Britain and 
Latin America. 
Like other owners of power generation sites, PPL has been profiting immensely 
under deregulation by charging rates based on the forces of supply and 
demand. Montana Power still distributes electric power around the state, but 
soon will be getting out of that business as well. 
The change has left large power consumers such as Montana Resources 
scrambling to survive. They have scoured the region for affordable 
alternatives. They have asked PPL to make at least some cheaper electricity 
available but it is unclear if that will happen. And they have lobbied the 
Legislature to reregulate electrical power. 
""We've got to play all of our cards,"" said Greg Stricker, president of 
Montana Resources, as he gazed over the company's open mining pit and a giant 
statue of the Virgin Mary that sits high on a mountain above it. ""We're faced 
with extinction."" PPL, however, says it has no choice but to sell its power 
at market prices. 
On a national scale, the plight of Montana , which has less than a million 
people, is not as visible as that of California, which has 34 million. But 
Montana 's experience shows what can happen when power prices spiral out of 
control and businesses and consumers are not protected. 
Montana 's power crisis is rooted in the history of the Montana Power Co. It 
was formed in 1912 by Anaconda Copper Mining to ensure power for Anaconda's 
extensive mining, milling and sawmill operations. Montana Power built 
hydroelectric dams on 11 rivers across the state, dams that still create 
power at low cost. 
Anaconda also was accustomed to getting its own way. The company owned most 
of the state's daily newspapers until 1959 and wielded tremendous influence 
among elected officials. Anaconda, the historian Bernard DeVoto wrote, 
""maintained a more thorough-going ownership of Montana 's wealth, government 
and inhabitants than any other corporation has ever been able to maintain in 
any other state."" 
The Anaconda era ended in 1977 when the company was bought by Atlantic 
Richfield, the oil company that has since been acquired by BP. Arco closed 
the mines in 1980 and the smelter in 1983. Montana Power, which had become 
the state's regulated utility, outlived its creator. 
By the mid-1990s, however, Montana Power was worrying about its own future. 
Power deregulation, a national trend, looked inevitable, and the company's 
big industrial customers already were shopping for sources of cheaper 
electricity . 
So, trying to make a virtue of necessity, Montana Power began the process of 
getting out of the power business. It diversified, creating an Internet 
service provider called Touch America. It also began to push for power 
deregulation, saying it would result in lower costs and more customer 
choices. The company was hoping that deregulation would make itself 
attractive to investors and potential buyers. 
A deregulation bill, the Electric Utility Restructuring and Customer Choice 
Act, was introduced in March 1997, when the legislative session was nearly 
over. Lawmakers, most of them farmers and ranchers and businessmen, approved 
it hastily. 
To some critics of deregulation, the passage smacked of the era when Anaconda 
dictated what the Legislature should do. Few Montana lawmakers understood 
what was happening, said Ken Toole, a Democratic state senator and an 
opponent of the deregulation. ""It was a steamroller with the mantra of free 
market,"" Toole said. ""Debate took place in a compressed period of time and it 
was not brought before the public."" 
Montana Power disputed that interpretation. Jack Haffey, its president and 
chief operating officer, said, ""it was not a bill pulled out of somebody's 
pocket and foisted on the public."" 
Still, Montana Power emerged with marketable power plants and its thriving 
Touch America business. The company sold its power plants to PPL, investing 
much of the proceeds in Touch America. Montana Power's shares, adjusted for 
an August 1999 split, soared to nearly $65 in March 2000 from less than $20 
before deregulation. (The shares have since returned to a below-$20 range, 
closing on Friday at $16.48) Company insiders cashed in their stock options 
at the peak and some became rich. 
And, for a while at least, deregulation appeared to be working. Competition 
among power suppliers was pushing down the price of electricity . In January 
1999, Montana Resources' power costs fell to $19 a megawatt hour from the 
regulated price of $30. 
But starting in June 2000, Stricker said, ""the market started to go nuts."" 
Rising demand, coupled with a lack of new supply, pushed up prices sharply. A 
megawatt hour spiked as high as $680 and then settled back into the 
$200-to-$400 range. 
The region's power crisis has been aggravated recently by a drought that has 
reduced the amount of hydroelectric power generated. Steve Walsh, a Montana 
Resources spokesman, said the company's suppliers told it that rates could 
reach $1,000 a megawatt hour in the third quarter. 
Montana 's labor force, meanwhile, has suffered. Since last summer, according 
to the Montana affiliate of the AFL-CIO, more than 1,000 workers have lost 
their jobs in layoffs caused by power price inflation.","JIM ROBBINS

Enron to Sell Credit-Linked Notes in Several Currencies

     London, May 2 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. plans to raise money
by selling credit-linked notes in several currencies, according to
Salomon Smith Barney, which will manage the sale with UBS Warburg.
     The sale will follow presentations to investors in Europe and
will consist of issues of intermediate maturities, Salomon said in
a faxed statement. Investors usually regard notes maturing in five
to seven years to be intermediate maturities. Salomon declined to
provide details on the size or timing of the sale.
     Credit-linked notes are typically backed by a pool of assets
owned by the issuer. The payments on the notes are often linked to
the creditworthiness of those assets.
     Houston-based Enron has branched out from its gas pipeline
business to include trading in financial contracts such as gas and
electricity futures and derivatives on corporate bankruptcies.
     Enron owns $65 billion in assets, including 32,000 miles of
pipeline that span 21 states and transport 15 percent of all of
the natural gas consumed in the U.S. Other assets include an
18,000-mile fiber-optic network in the U.S. and 51 power plants
and other energy projects in 15 countries.
     Last week Enron agreed to cancel its $3.1 billion sale of
Portland General Electric Co. to Sierra Pacific Resources, after
both companies decided the California energy crisis had made it
too hard to win approval. The state of California has banned power
plant sales by utilities until 2006 amid an electricity shortage.
     Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., California's two largest utilities, have run up more
than $14 billion in debt from buying power at soaring prices. The
two utilities are nearly insolvent.
     Enron has $15.8 billion in bonds outstanding, of which $2.7
billion mature this year, according to Bloomberg figures. Enron is
rated ``BBB+'' by Standard & Poor's and ``Baa1'' by Moody's
Investors Service.

Scottish Power reportedly considering 3 bln usd bid for Enron's Portland

04/29/2001
AFX News 
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd 

LONDON (AFX) - Scottish Power PLC is considering a move to bolster its U.S. 
West Coast operations by bidding for Enron Corp unit Portland General for 
around 3 bln usd, reports the Observer, without citing sources. 

Enron last week broke off talks with U.S. utility Sierra Pacific over a deal 
said to be worth 3.1 bln. This opened the door to Scottish Power, the report 
says.

An unnamed City source said Portland, which sells power to 725,000 customers 
in and around the Oregon state capital, would be a perfect fit for the 
Pacificorp business in the north-west U.S. which Scottish bought in 1999 for 
4.7 bln stg. Scottish has consistently said it wants to build up its business 
in the U.S. 

PacifiCorp has some 1.5 mln residential, commercial and industrial customers 
spread in Oregon, California, Washington, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho. 

""Portland sits in the middle of PacifiCorp territory in Oregon,"" the source 
said. ""There would be added customers and big synergies in infrastructure, 
opera tions, and head office functions. It would make sense.""

2001-04-29 11:30 (New York)

     Glasgow, Scotland, April 29 (Bloomberg) -- ScottishPower Plc,
the U.K.'s No. 2 utility, may bid for Enron Corp.'s Portland
General Electric Co. in a transaction worth as much as $3 billion,
the Observer newspaper said.
     ScottishPower spokesman Gordon Laidlaw declined to comment on
the newspaper's report.
     Portland General has 725,000 customers in Oregon. Its
operations and infrastructure could fit with PacifiCorp, the
biggest utility in the U.S. Northwest, which ScottishPower bought
for $10.7 billion in 1999, the paper said.
     Last week, Enron's planned sale of Portland General to Sierra
Pacific Resources was canceled after both companies agreed that
the California energy crisis had made regulatory approval too
difficult.
     ScottishPower has asked Oregon regulators to allow it to
raise customer prices in the state by 24 percent for three months
from May 2 to cover costs it expects to incur in the period. The
company is losing about $1 million a day because of a failure at a
plant in Utah.

A Tale of two Australias 
Wine Team Picks: Julian Davies on Sainted Brothers Wines 


Exclusive Deal from Down Under

This week www.wine.com travels to the Southern Hemisphere, where 
some of the world's most attractive wines are now being made. As 
evidence, we're offering newsletter subscribers a special deal on a 
dynamite pair of reds from Tapestry, an Australian label that we 
represent exclusively in the United States. 

Before we tasted Tapestry's 1998 bottlings, we'd only heard rumors 
about this unusual vintage Down Under - a rare confluence of warm 
ripening conditions with a long growing season that conferred great 
depth of character. As soon as we sampled the Bin 338 Shiraz and Bin 
388 Cabernet Sauvignon, we realized the talk was true. Both wines are 
profoundly complex, but also deliriously enjoyable because of their 
rich, fat, berry fruit. They're classic examples of serious wines 
that are delicious now but will also improve for years to come. 

Eventually, Wine & Spirits magazine caught on, awarding both of these 
beauties 90+ scores. That made us feel rather cagey, since we'd 
already imported them and own their American rights. Australian wines 
of this caliber commonly command prices around $50, but we're able to 
offer these to you for less than half that. Just our way of saying, 
""Good on ya.""

A Tale of Two Australias

Among wine enthusiasts, it's now a commonly held belief that the 
world's most exciting region is Australia. Why? A constellation of 
factors including old vines, new technology, and, not 
insignificantly, the famous Australian mindset, which is 
straightforward, unpretentious, and fun loving. 

""Australians aren't wine snobs,"" observes wine.com senior merchant 
Jeff Prather. ""They're down to earth. They have a European heritage, 
but they started their own culture, which didn't kowtow to tradition. 
American wine lovers have always seemed to think that they had to 
emulate Europe."" 

Vibrant wine culture
Interestingly in that light, Australia has the highest per-capita 
wine consumption in the English-speaking world. It covers about the 
same amount of surface area as the United States, but has only 6 
percent of the population. 

""Australians have huge amounts of arable land, but they don't have 
the population base to tend it,"" says wine.com merchant Bo Thompson. 
""As a result, they've had to learn to practice winemaking through 
technology."" From computerized 70,000-gallon tanks to state-of-the- 
art refrigeration to horizontal ""rotofermenters"" that punch down 
grapes automatically, Australia is the world's trendsetter in 
winemaking technology. 

In addition to enabling the industry to get its work done, this 
gadgetry has developed with an eye to serving the national palate. 
Its enthusiasms can be described in three words: fruit, fruit, 
and fruit. The trademark Australian wine style is big, ripe, and 
extracted, emphasizing the flavor -- and power -- of the grape 
above all. 

Advanced yet artisanal
Curiously, this is consistent with another important though seemingly 
opposite trend in the Aussie revolution: the renaissance of Old World 
artisanal winemaking, a decidedly low-tech approach that focuses on 
ancient vines, some dating to the 19th century. 

""[The Australian artisanal approach] has everything to do with what's 
going on in the vineyard,"" says Thompson. ""The recent generation has 
drastically improved its vineyard techniques through different types 
of trellising and experimentation with irrigation and dry farming. 
They're bringing back a lot of old vines that had been left to the 
wild - for example, d'Arenberg's Dead Arm Shiraz is made from vines 
that have been half-killed by disease -- divided right down the 
middle. But the fruit extraction they're getting is amazing."" 

""If you name the greatest wines in Australia,"" says Prather, you'd 
have to include d'Arenberg, Penfolds Grange, Clarendon Hills, 
Elderton, and Henschke Hill of Grace.... A lot of them are old-vine 
fanatics, and for that you have to pay a price -- those wines are 
expensive. But the other gift that Australia gives the world is 
oceans of really good wine that doesn't pretend to be great. Wineries 
like Rosemount, Penfolds, Punters Corner, and Yering Station produce 
gigantic amounts of bargain-priced wines with consistently terrific 
flavor. So what you've got, really, is a tale of two continents: a 
tiny amount of great artisanal wines and gigantic amounts of 
friendly, quaffable wines."" 

What they all have in common, Prather sums up, is that ""they're flat- 
out delicious. Australians have hit the sweet spot of the modern 
palate: wines with consistently ripe and juicy flavors due to their 
warm climate, but with really friendly textures that aren't overly 
tannic, astringent, or acidic. In the contemporary wine business, 
that is a sure-fire formula for success.""

Wine Team Picks: Julian Davies on Sainted Brothers Wines

It's widely known that yesterday, February 14, was St. Valentine's 
Day. But now that you're finished pandering to the candyman, can you 
name the saints who are honored today? 

I thought as much. February 15 is a day that commemorates St. 
Faustinus and St. Jovita. Born in northern Italy in the second 
century, this pair of brothers preached the word with such fervor 
that they enraged a heathen lord named Julian (no relation), who 
ordered them arrested and tortured. Ultimately Emperor Hadrian had 
them beheaded. 

A modern analogue of Faustinus and Jovita might be Ethan and Joel 
Coen, a pair of steadfast siblings who have maintained their filmic 
faith despite ceaseless heathen persecution -- the most recent result 
being their movie ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Hence, herewith, in 
observance of St. Faustinus and St. Jovita Day, five wines paired 
with five films from St. Ethan and St. Joel. 

1999 Torres Sangre de Toro, Catalonia, Spain
""Blood Simple"" 

1997 Bouchard Beaune Premier Cru Les Greves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus,

""Raising Arizona""

Power deregulation backfires in infancy (9.27.2000)
MANY OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL WORK EVENTUALLY 
BY STEVE JOHNSON
Mercury News 
With its residents reeling from surging summertime electricity bills, this 
coastal state's deregulated energy market has triggered bitter accusations, 
legislative hearings and a push to re-regulate the whole system. 
Sound familiar? Except this isn't California. It's New York, one of 23 other 
states that are ending what has been for decades one of government's key 
functions -- keeping tight control on the price of power. 
The great national experiment to open the sale of electricity to competition, 
which California has been largely credited with pioneering, was supposed to 
lower prices by freeing consumers from the monopolistic grip of government 
regulated utilities. Indeed, energy officials in many states retain hope that 
it eventually will do that. 
But throughout the country, a sense of foreboding has overtaken people like 
Susan Peckman, who manages Peckman's Liquor Store in Pearl River, N.Y. Hers 
is the only state outside California so far where consumers have been exposed 
to the discomfitting impact of fully deregulated prices. And she doesn't feel 
liberated. 
``There's nothing we can do about it,'' said Peckman, who estimated that her 
store's electricity bill has jumped about 20 percent this summer over last 
year's. Faced with the option of paying it or closing down, she added, 
``you're between a rock and a hard place.'' 
It has been four years since California became one of the first states to 
pass an energy deregulation law. Yet the movement to revamp the way power is 
sold in this country remains mired in a ``prolonged and muddled transition,'' 
according to a study published this month by Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates and the Arthur Andersen consulting firm. 
It's unclear when or even if that transition will ever be completed. In many 
parts of the country, public officials are terrified of plunging ahead with 
deregulation, given the high prices and other problems in California and New 
York. Some even harbor suspicions that California has led the nation astray 
by promoting an idea that is inherently flawed. 
California Public Utilities Commissioner Henry Duque said he encountered that 
attitude during a summer meeting of the National Association of Regulatory 
Utility Commissioners in Los Angeles. 
``I had other commissioners coming up to me saying, `What the hell is going 
on here,' '' Duque said. ``They were concerned. I think their thought was, 
did we in California see something that was wrong with deregulation but 
weren't going to level with them now that they had started down the path?'' 
Actually, the federal government bears much of the responsibility for 
initiating the drive to ease public control of electricity markets. 
Hoping to encourage new sources of electricity, Congress passed laws in 1978 
and 1992 that forced utility companies to buy increasing amounts of the power 
they use from other, unregulated energy suppliers. In 1996, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission also made it possible for other firms to ship 
their power over the high-voltage lines the utilities owned. 
Consumers were looking for a change, too. By the mid-1990s, the service 
provided by utility firms had become a sore subject. California had some of 
the highest utility rates in the country, and the electrical system's 
reliability was under fire. 
If only other companies could be lured into the market to compete, it was 
widely assumed, prices would plummet and overall customer satisfaction would 
improve. 
New York, New Hampshire and Rhode Island passed laws or made administrative 
rulings to deregulate slightly before California, where deregulation was 
approved in September 1996. 
Rhode Island and Massachusetts were first to give residents the ability to 
choose which company sold them their electricity. But because of its size and 
much publicized deliberations about its plan to deregulate during the 1990s, 
California was labeled the national leader on the issue. 
In many ways, however, deregulation in the state has been a flop -- at least, 
so far. 
Californians have had the right to pick their energy supplier since March 31, 
1998, when the electricity market was officially unfettered. That ability to 
choose was seen as an essential way to spur competition and, ultimately, 
lower energy prices. 
But as of Aug. 15, less than 2 percent of California's homeowners, businesses 
and others had seen fit to drop their local utility for some other supplier. 
By contrast, in Pennsylvania -- one of 13 other states that now let people 
choose -- 10 percent of customers have switched. 
Critics say that's a misleading comparison since Pennsylvania, unlike 
California, gives an energy price discount to consumers who make the switch. 
Nonetheless, Pennsylvania officials are clearly happy about how deregulation 
is working. 
A study in August by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge concluded that electricity 
competition will result in 36,400 new jobs and a $1.4 billion boost in 
personal income across the state by 2004. 
``We do not anticipate the problems in Pennsylvania that you have out there 
in California,'' said Kevin Cadden, a spokesman with that state's Public 
Utility Commission. ``I am not nervous at all.'' 
A study this summer by the non-profit Center for the Advancement of Energy 
Markets, which promotes deregulation, found that Pennsylvania has pushed 
electricity competition more effectively and quickly than any other state. 
Others listed in order in the top 10 were New York, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Texas, Nevada, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. California 
was 16th. 
But consumers may have a different measure of success: whether their lights 
will stay on and how much electricity will cost them once government controls 
are removed. Unfortunately, in the two states where prices have been fully 
deregulated, the evidence is not encouraging. 
In San Diego, the first place in California to have its state-mandated cap on 
utility rates lifted under deregulation, electricity bills for many consumers 
this summer doubled, while power blackouts also rolled through Northern 
California. New York's experience wasn't quite as bad. But in the few 
counties there that were exposed to fully deregulated electricity rates this 
summer, the average residential bill rose 22 percent. 
Investigations are under way in California and New York to determine what 
happened. Nonetheless, the problems in both states have been largely blamed 
on an insufficient supply of power plants to meet their demand for 
electricity, which has forced consumers to pay just about whatever 
power-producing firms want to charge. 
``It's the piece that the economists missed'' when deregulation was touted 
several years ago, said Mike Donovan, a spokesman for Orange and Rockland 
Utilities, Inc., which supplies power to Susan Peckman's Pearl River liquor 
store, among other parts of New York. ``There isn't sufficient generation to 
really administer a full-scale competitive market.'' 
Ralph Cavanagh of the National Resources Defense Council in San Francisco 
maintains that deregulation has been unfairly maligned because the dearth of 
power plants has made it impossible for consumers to benefit from 
competition. Once that and some other problems are fixed, he said, ``I'm 
confident we'll have a more orderly market in the future.'' 
Others are growing nervous, however. This summer's difficulties have spurred 
calls to significantly stall or even reverse deregulation in North Carolina, 
Nevada, New Mexico, Minnesota, Oregon and Alabama, among other states. 
A Wisconsin consumer advocate recently chuckled over the phone as she read 
aloud a story about California's energy crisis, noting that such news made 
her opposition to deregulation much easier. 
``I am absolutely convinced that we are on an inexorable march toward the 
choice model,'' said Ken Malloy, president of the Center for the Advancement 
of Energy Markets. But he acknowledged that the experience in San Diego and 
New York ``is undeniably a bad thing that has happened to this movement, and 
it will set us back.''

 FYI.  Edison has been successful at peeling off one of the ESPs--New West.  Seems that in exchange for getting paid negative CTCs, New West may have agreed to take the position that all DA customers should be charged for Edison's undercollection. I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position.  The salient quote in New West's ""supplemental"" PHC statement reads:

""It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission.""

Obviously, not a helpful statement.  New West's supplemental PHC statement is attached.

Applewhite, Freshmen Receivers Lead Horns
To 52-10 Opening Win; UT No. 5 in AP Poll

The Longhorns opened their season at home Saturday by falling behind a
45-point underdog Louisiana-Lafayette team, but Major Applewhite came off t=
he
bench to spark a 31-point second quarter that paved the way for a 52-10
victory and a No. 5 ranking in the latest Associated Press Poll.
Heralded sophomore Chris Simms got the starting nod at quarterback over
Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee surgery after earning Big 12
Offensive Player of the Year honors in 1999.
But Simms had a rocky start, and when his sideline pass was intercepted and
returned for a touchdown that gave the Ragin' Cajuns a shocking 10-0 lead
with 1:27 left in the first quarter, the coaches turned to Applewhite to tr=
y
to pump some life into the dormant Longhorn offense.
And he delivered big time. He led the Longhorns to seven straight scores =
=01)
six touchdowns and a field goal =01) before retiring for the day and lettin=
g
Simms handle the mop-up duties.
For the day, Applewhite was 18 of 26 for 315 yards and four touchdowns =01)=
 and
that was in less than two quarters. He came in for the final 1:27 of the
first quarter, played all the second quarter and then left for keeps just
4:51 deep into the third quarter with the Longhorns on top, 45-10.
Coach Mack Brown still says the team has two first-team quarterbacks and he
still says he won't name a starter for the Stanford game, but there is litt=
le
doubt that the quarterback controversy is over and Applewhite is the starti=
ng
quarterback once again.
These coaches grade on performance and his scoring percentage Saturday was
perfect =01) seven possessions, seven scores that turned a 10-0 hole into a
45-10 romp when he left the game.
True freshmen wide receiver Roy Williams also had a big day. He caught six
passes for 105 yards, including a super one-handed grab for 40 yards to get
the Longhorns off their two-yard line.
Heading into this game, the Longhorns had four big questions, and three of
them got positive answers.
Unfortunately, the one that didn't get the positive answer was the key one.
Here are the questions, and the answers, at least for the short term:
1. Will the offensive line do a better job of blocking?
This is the one that didn't get the positive answer. It actually did a good
job of pass protecting, but the Longhorns couldn't run the football against=
 a
bad team that has small defensive linemen.
Unless the line improves and the Horns can run with some success, the good
defensive linemen will do just what our defensive linemen do against the
Oklahoma's of the world, which is pin their ears back and harass the
quarterback on every play.
2. Will those young wide receivers be able to pick up the slack for Kwame
Cavil, Ryan Nunez and Jeremy Jones, last year's big three?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas, the three heralded
true freshmen, combined to catch 11 passes for 182 yards, and another gjuy
seeing his first action, redshirt freshman Artie Ellis, tacked on four more
catches for 38 more yards and two touchdowns. As Darrell Royal used to say,
""if a dog will bite, he'll bite as a pup."" These pups have big teeth and th=
ey
know how to use them.
3. Will the special teams be better?
They were Saturday. Brown said the kicking game ""was the best since we've
been here,"" and that tells the story. Kris Stockton punted for a 48-yard
average, the kickoffs went team, and the Longhorn punt and kickoff returner=
s
got some positive yardage.
4. Will the young defensive ends be able to fill in for four-year starter
Aaron Humphrey and Cedric Woodard, a three-starter, first at tackle, then a=
t
end?
Sophomores Cole Pittman and Cory Redding, who was still bothered by a knee
sprain, and true freshman Kalen Thornton all played well, and junior Jermai=
n
Anderson, who is swift but undersized, did a good job of rushing the passer=
.
This is a Longhorn team with a lot going for it in terms of talent, coachin=
g
and a more favorable schedule, but the lack of a dependable running game
could prove fatal against a team that can pressure the quarterbacks.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:

FIRST QUARTER
With the temperature at 85 and rising, the Longhorns won the toss and
deferred The Cajuns ran the deep kickoff back to the 19, then drove 77 yard=
s
in 15 plays, using up nearly half of the first quarter, before stalling at
the Longhorn 4 and settling for a field goal to take a 3-0 lead with 7:55
left. Simms, getting the start over Applewhite at quarterback, led the Horn=
s
on a 40-yard drive that ended when Kris Stockton was wide on a 52-yard fiel=
d
goal try. The Cajuns couldn't move and had to punt, but Simms' third-down
pass was picked off by Terrance Hunter at the UT 43 and he dashed in for th=
e
score to give the 45-point underdog Cajuns a 10-0 lead with 1:27 left. Vict=
or
Ike ran the kickoff back to the 46 and Applewhite came in and  hit TB Hodge=
s
Mitchell for 17 yards, then found Williams twice, for 9 and 24 yards, to
reach the Cajun 4 as the quarter ended.

SECOND QUARTER
Mitchell darted over right tackle for four yards and the touchdown on the
first play of the quarter to get UT back in the game at 10-7. On the Horns'
remaining four possessions in the half, Applewhite swiftly moved them 80 an=
d
98 yards for touchdowns, nine yards for a field goal and 28 yards for a
touchdown after a Joe Walker interception. That 31-point explosion put Texa=
s
comfortably on top at 31-10 at intermission. In that decisive second quarte=
r,
Texas had 290 yards offensively and Louisiana had 77.

THIRD QUARTER
Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the UT 45 and Applewhite took Texas o=
n
two more quick scoring jaunts, first zipping 55 yards in five plays and the=
n
going 58 yards in four plays for two more TDs to push score to 45-10 and gi=
ve
him a perfect seven scores in seven tries. Simms relieved him at that point
and hit three straight passes to lead Texas to its final touchdown with 6:5=
3
left in the quarter. Neither team threatened serious for the remainder of t=
he
quarter.

FOURTH QUARTER
The Longhorns went back to trying to run the ball in the final quarter,
without much success. The Cajuns did have one late drive that got to the
Texas 16 before stalling, but that was the last serious drive by either tea=
m.

True Orange Observations

It was feast or famine for the Longhorns in the running game. Here's the ne=
t
gain on each running play in chronological order:
0, 12, 0, 11, 5, 3, 0, 4, 1, 9, 1, minus 1, 0, 0,28, 7, 0, minus 4, 2, 7, 1=
,
minus 5, 4, 2.
That is the primary reason Texas had the ball only 21:19 and Louisiana had =
it
38:41.
Most of the successful runs were draw plays. There were very few times when
normal running plays made any yardage.
In a 52-10 romp past an overmatched opponent, this is no big deal. But it
could cost the team two or three games down the line unless the regular
running plays start being more productive on a consistent basis.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns had to quit trying to run the ball
Saturday because Louisiana-Lafayette had ""guys lined up in  every gap and
they blitzed on every play.""
He said he really wanted to establish a running game early, but it was much
more sensible to go to an all-out passing attack because of the defense the
Ragin' Cajuns were playing.
Brown said, "" I was surprised Major (Applewhite) was able to play as well a=
s
he did the first time back after knee surgery.""
""Major played really well,"" he said. ""The protection was great. The momentu=
m
really changed when we put Major in, but we also changed our offense and
starting putting four wide receivers out on every play.""
He said Applewhite and Chris Simms, who started the game and played the fir=
st
two series before giving way to Applewhite, ""are both starting quarterbacks=
.
""Chris had the great spring and he had an outstanding fall, but it wasn't
that Major got beaten out. We just think we have two starting quarterbacks.=
""
He also said, ""You just as well not ask me about next week's starter becaus=
e
I'm not going to say.""
I didn't know who it would be in the opener, but I'm betting on Applewhite =
to
get the nod Saturday night in Palo Alto against the dangerous Stanford
Cardinal because of his outstanding relief duty.
Brown said he was pleasantly surprised with the  way his young receivers
performed. ""It's been a long time since I've seen freshmen play with
composure like that,"" he said.
Roy Williams became the first UT freshman ever to pick up a 100-yard
receiving game in his first start. He grabbed six passes for 105 yards,
including a spectacular one-handed catch on a 40-yarder from Applewhite.
""Roy really played well,"" Brown said. ""One of the catches he made was
phenomenal.""
Two other true freshman wide receivers =01) B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas =
=01)
also had outstanding debuts.
""B. J. made some great catches,"" Brown said, ""and Sloan comes in, makes a
catch on the sideline, then makes two guys miss.""
""I'm really pleased with the way the freshmen played,"" Brown said. ""They ke=
pt
their poise and helped us win the game.""
Artie Ellis, a redshirt freshman, also had a good day, catching four passes
for 38 yards, including two touchdowns.
Ellis was a smashing success during spring practice and was expected to mak=
e
a big impact this year because of his 6-4, 210-pound frame and good speed a=
nd
his ability to catch the ball in a crowd.
The four freshmen receivers accounted for 15 of the Longhorns' 25 reception=
s
and 220 of their 403 passing yards.
Little-used fifth-year senior Brandon Healy also made up for lost time, wit=
h
four catches, two of them for touchdowns, for a total of 88 yards.
Getting back to the quarterback duel, Brown said both players are handling
the situation well and ""the team has confidence in both of them to get the
job done.""
""We have to keep both of these quarterbacks upbeat,"" Brown said. ""We'll nee=
d
both of them to accomplish the goals we have set.""
He said he and offensive coordinator Greg Davis ""talked to the guys long an=
d
hard about playing two quarterbacks.""
""We will always talk to the players about the quarterback situation before
anyone else,"" he said. ""We're not going to throw one in or out because of a
fan poll.""
At his Sunday press conference, Brown said he was very pleased with the
team's first-down efficiency, offensively and defensively, and was happy
with the special teams' play.
Looking at the lack of run production, he said, ""When you score 52 points,
it's not important, but, for the season, it is important.""
He said the Longhorns will work hard on improving their running game this
week. ""We have to do a better job on running the football,"" he said.
This was the fourth straight game in which the Horns had less than 100 yard=
s
rushing, but they lost the other three to end last season, so this time it
wasn't fatal.
Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette deserves a lot of credit for playing hard an=
d
he said Cajun QB Derek Dyer ""played really great.""
""But I thought our team was focused,"" he said. ""Louisiana had nothing to
lose, but he had a lot to lose and nothing to gain.""
He said all aspects of the kicking game pleased him Saturday. ""The kicking
game was the best since we've been here,"" he said.


15 Freshmen Play

Fifteen freshmen played in Saturday's opening game.
Eight of them were true freshmen and seven were redshirt freshmen.
The eight true freshmen were WRs Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan
Thomas, TE Brock Edwards, DE Kalen Thornton, DT Stevie Lee, CB Nathan Vashe=
r
and S Phillip Geiggar.
Williams, Johnson, Thornton and Lee played very early in the game.
The seven redshirt freshmen were WR Artie Ellis, RB Ivan Williams, FB Brett
Robin, OG Tillman Holloway, DT Marcus Tubbs, MLB Reed Boyd and S Dakarai
Pearson.
Holloway started due to weakened condition of Derrick Dockery, who was
hospitalized last week with an infected cyst.
Pearson also started because he is the nickel back and defensive coordinato=
r
Carl Reese came out with a five-defensive-back formation to start the game.
Ellis and Boyd also saw a lot of early action.
Inexperience at wide receiver was expected to be a problem for the Longhorn=
s
this season, but the trio of big, fast freshmen and Ellis combined Saturday
to show it as a team strength.
""Those guys don't play like freshmen,"" Applewhite said.

Scouting Stanford

The Longhorns face their first major test Saturday night when they play
defending Pac 10 champion Stanford in Palo Alto.
The game will start at 9:15 Texas time and will be televised by the Fox
Network.
Texas clobbered Stanford, 69-17, last year in Austin, and the Cardinal will
be trying to turn the tables this year.
Stanford went 8-4 overall last season and won the Pac 10 with a 7-1 record.
But all four of the seniors they lost on offense were first-team All-Pac-10
players. They included QB Todd Husak and WR Troy Walters, the league's
all-time leading receiver, plus two veteran offensive linemen
Six defensive starters return from last year, including four linemen. But
only one linebacker and one defensive back who started a year ago are on ha=
nd.
Stanford opened the season with a 24-10 victory over Washington State, and
the Cardinal defense did not allow an offensive touchdown, but then the
Cardinal fell to San Jose State, 40-27, Saturday night.
San Jose State beat Stanford with a powerful running game. Spartan TB Deonc=
e
Whitaker gained 254 yards on 21 carries, scoring on runs of 5 and 65 yards
and setting up two other TDs with long runs.
Stanford QB Randy Fasani threw for 361 yards and four touchdowns in the
offensive slugfest.
If the Longhorns are going to have a running game anytime soon, this will b=
e
their best chance to do it.
Texas probably will be at least a 10-point favorite, but this could be a
dangerous game unless the Longhorns tackle better than they did last week a=
nd
force a few turnovers.
The Horns also need to get their running game going or it will be one of
those four-hour, 100-pass shootouts.
Here are the three keys to victory, in my opinion:
1. Win the rushing battle. That doesn't sound like a big order against the
pass-happy Cardinal, but the Longhorns haven't had a 100-yard rushing game =
in
their last four outings.
2. Put a lot of pressure on Fasani and do a good job of protecting the Texa=
s
quarterbacks.
3. Take care of the ball. Texas needs to win the turnover battle.
I think this is a dangerous road trip, but I'll go out on a limb and pick t=
he
Longhorns to win by a 42-28 score. I think Texas will pressure Fasani and
take care of the ball. Hopefully, the Horns can run the ball, too, but two
out of three should be good enough.

619,"To transition Enron's Sandhill Management Committee members from Jim/Billy to 
Kevin/Dave I have drafted and legal has reviewed a notification letter 
(attached below) that Jim Ducote is going to hand deliver to Andy Ramirez 
(Austin's Mgt Committee member) at a meeting he has with him on Monday 5/21 
to insure a smooth transition.

The management committee meetings are held whenever necessary approximately 
once per month during construction, but should be less frequent now that the 
plant is to be operational May 23.  Jim has mentioned there will be some 
issues that need to be cleaned up such as the plant's construction delay (was 
guaranteed to be complete 5/1) at the next meeting that should take place in 
June.  Also, I think adding capacity to the demineralization plant is a 
""no-brainer"" to enable us to run the plant at full on the weekends.

Kevin/Dave if you would like to call Andy Ramirez his number is (512) 
322-6479.

If anyone has any concerns with this transition please call me asap at 
x3-4258.

626,"Rob, we may be saying the same thing here - for the EES outsourcing 
proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by 
Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC.  
Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.  My view is 
that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and 
execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals. It is 
an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals. 
The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule 
between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia 
Lakes.  All other industrial business other than P&P commodity/asset business 
is the perview of ECC.

Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the 
deal structuring/due diligence queue.  The US group can help get these done 
and can help in the pitch.

Lippman Consulting, Inc. has just completed the 3 rd quarter of 2001 San Juan 
Basin production report. This report contains historical gas volumes that are 
separated out by conventional and coal seam properties. The report also 
separates the production by each contributing state.  Volumes are reported 
annually as well as quarterly for the past 10 years.  The report contains 
charts and graphs depicting various historical statistics including the gas 
production volumes, number of new wells drilled each year and monthly rig 
activity. The data clearly shows that the San Juan Basin  production has 
peaked and is now on a decline.

Adam and Claire had fun-Adam was Harry Potter and Claire was a lion too!Things are really good for me. I cut my hours down to 32 hours a week and it has made all the difference in the world in terms of feeling like I can cope with this job. It has been taking a toll on me-lots of young patients our age dying and stuff. Anyway, things are Great! Marty man is doing good. I worked out with Jody Jurgens last week and it was her 1 year anniversary of being married. She's married to a very nice guy. My mom just got back from 18 days in Ireland-her 3rd time. She had a good time. Teresa and her clan were in Omaha for the game this saturday-what a blowout and Brian and his girlfriend (of 2 years) came over. We love her too. We told Brian if they break up were keeping her. Anyway I digress. I was just so touched to get that card from you and thought with all that is going on in the country right now, I've really reviewed in my life the things that really matter to me, what's really im!

There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.

strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket.  

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.    

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $2207 international (after discounts). Enron's average savings
are $144 domestic and $587 international (before fees).  The savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee!

If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online, you may continue to
do so by booking through ClickTrip.  ClickTrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to Enron's negotiated discounts.  Ticketing through
ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of $15 if no agent assistance is
necessary.  There is no charge to look at schedules.   ClickTrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through Enron's intranet site
<http://travel.enron.com> or via the Internet site
<http://www.resassist.com/enron/>.  ClickTrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status.  To check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary, simply click the Check My Trip
button on the ClickTrip home page and fill in your name and Amadeus locator
number (provided at the top of your itinerary).  A user log-in may be
obtained by contacting Alliance at 713 328-5100.

If your office location, phone number or any profile information has
changed, please notify us by return email.  A profile form is attached if
you prefer to fax the information to Alliance at 713 328-5600 or if you are
a new traveler wishing to set up a profile.

We at Alliance are proud of our 17 year association with Enron and dedicated
to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price
for all of your travel needs.  We have a highly trained and experienced
staff working on Enron's account and we look forward to providing you with
continued service for years to come.  
If you have any questions regarding any of the changes mentioned, or wish to
discuss specific details relating to your corporate travel policies, please

	Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of Khalid.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the ""washed in stardust"" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart!
	We had a great visit with ""PaPaFlo""!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught Sam to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.  We went on the slide, ""go to swingies"", ""play-da-cars"", ""draw-da-picture"", ""play-da-firetruck"", ""ride-da-wagon"" and ""read-da-book"" - and I was happy to hear PaPaFlo proceeding each of those phrases rather than Mommy.  Sam is busy!
	I heard Khalid had a cough.  I hope that clears up soon.  I also heard you were looking at a new house.  That's exciting - I'm sure you could use the room.  Good luck with that!
	Tony is on the third week of his new job.  It seems to be going well.  He was bored, but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish.  I hope Ahmed's new job is good too.  Amy, I heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with Khalid.  That is really a blessing.
	I won't mention how my job is going, except I'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know.
	We were sad to hear about Mr. Sutton.
	The kids are all fine.  Missy was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and Dad while they were here.  She probably thought she might get a present =)
	I need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of Sam.  I'll try to get those your way soon.  I'm sure Dad & Flo will have some from their visit too.

Take care!
Love,

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

Hello Chris,

As per our conversation, I checked out some prices on the 1989 Porsche
911.  Right now the price for 1,000,000 liability, collision $1000
deductible, comprehensive $500 deductible would be about $1300 for six
months.  Your renewal is coming up in April and it looks as though your
rates would come down on this vehicle by $400. (The premiums on your
Jeep will also be coming down on renewal)  If you buy the vehicle and
just want to put fire, theft vandalism etc.. until spring, the cost is
about $280 for six months.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact
me by e-mail or by phone at 1-800-897-5074.

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation capacity 
for electronic bid (""package or packages""): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available transportation 
capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the total 
available transportation 
capacity under the specified package OR multiple rates can be submitted each 
for a partial 
amount of available transportation capacity under the specified package.? If 
the same 
Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest present value for such package of 
available 
transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids 
from the same 
Shipper for the same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than 
??????? minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x 
FERC Interest Rate x The 
??????? Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the maximum rate is 
bid, the following 
??????? formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid 
Quantity x days bid/100. 
??????? In case of a tie, each tied shipper will have the right to improve 
its bid by submitting an 
??????? improved bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? Such improved 
bid shall be faxed to 
??????? (801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still 
exists, such capacity 
??????? shall be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than indicated 
??????? for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid. 
?

Latest NFL Player News

Darnay Scott <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01
Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week. 

James Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. ! 
Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 11/23/01
According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/23/01
Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury. 

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/23/01
Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/ht! tp! ://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback. 

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/23/01
Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=10! 97! &>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01
Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=133291&>, RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/23/01
Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week. 

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunda! y.! Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsist! en! t this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.

James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.

Travis Minor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=235123&>, RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once a! ga! in. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.

Priest Holmes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1645&>, RB KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01
The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=4454&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass! /H! ull Updated 11/21/01
Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.

 We have a swing deal at this point with Equistar, which allows them to take 
excess volumes over the base nom.  We have been estimating the overtakes each 
day at 15, 000.  However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, we 
can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.  So, Equistar is within 
their rights and I am monitoring their activity, but the nom versus actual 
doesn't reflect this.  This occurs with a few of our industrial points.

694,"We are going to add a new drop down flag to STORAGE in SITARA to 
differentiate the difference between physical and synthetic storage - as each 
are
treated differently for inventory accounting purposes.   A change will also 
be made to Global Contracts and UNIFY, and is intended to assist with OA 
variances
on STORAGE.

On the next release (mid August) we will add a drop down on the STORAGE deal 
type which will be a required field.
Someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will be 
a required field - physical facility or synthetic. 
(We can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to be 
converted - as well as results for Global conversion)

Global Contracts uses the flags from SITARA to set up new contracts - so 
SITARA will add the flag on the deal.

The flag will be stored in Global Contracts - which will feed the flag to 
UNIFY.

Once the existing deals are converted in SITARA, Global Contracts can add the 
appropriate flag to their system.
Once this is complete and UNIFY is ready, UNIFY can begin to feed in the 
information from Global Contracts, and we will then 
be able to differentiate the two in the accounting system.

In the interim time, you may want to identify your synthetic vs. physical 
storage deals.

Let me know if you have any questions.

morning representing Regulatory.  Drew and Dari were there from law.  Drew 
led the presentation and covered the matrix/template that out study group 
submitted earlier.

Audience:  Rockey Storie, Kevin Hyatt, Bob Burleson in Houston.  Kent Miller 
and Tim Johanson in Omaha.

The material, presentation and discussion was well received and timely.  
Rockey indicated that, in a recent status meeting with Danny McCarty, Danny 
had asked if the commercial people were discussing their proposed deals with 
Law and Regulatory.  Rockey responded that there had been contact and 
discussion under way. 

As for the discussion, the audience easily and quickly picked up on the 
template format with most of the questions/comments focusing, as one might 
expect, on revenue/COS bottom line issues.  Pat was able to provide 
additional definition and comment to the group discussion and template 
display.

Dari led us through the ""jurisdictional"" issues regarding electric and gas 
service.  The abandonment of service concern that we expressed at the study 
group meetings was more or less put to bed when Marketing responded that, 
based on field operations input, turn-around time to stop a turbine, engage a 
different operation (e.g., run a compressor) could be accomplished in 1 -2 
hours.  ""Gearbox"" technology to shift operations is available.  We also 
touched on the jurisdictionality issue associated with the purchase of a 
compression service  - ala monetization.

Other concepts were brought up with regard to deal structure and financing 
alternatives but were tabled for the moment.  There was also a question, to 
be pursued, regarding air quality/permits using the engine to compress for 
natural gas service vs running a generator.

I really feel that the meeting was successful and appreciated in that, at the 
least, we were able to congeal much info on the matrix and facilitate what 
could have been a very lengthy discussion into a relatively brief meeting.  
Drew concluded by stating that the template should not be distributed outside 
ETS.  He suggested that, on a case-by-case basis, our study group of Legal 
and Regulatory personnel could quickly respond to case specific issues in a 
customized response that the commercial dealmaker could provide to their

790,"Anonymous Letters Put UtiliCorp in Hot Water

Investigations in several states are getting under way into alleged illegal 
profit-taking by UtiliCorp United in Missouri, Michigan, Nebraska, Minnesota 
and Iowa. An anonymous letter from someone who claimed to be a current 
employee for UtiliCorp was sent to state regulators alleging the company's 
Gas Supply Service Department (GSS) took part in improper actions in 
reselling natural gas to customers in these states. 

""Personnel are paid bonuses based on the value that can be extracted from 
managing the assets paid for by the Missouri Public Service (MPS) 
ratepayers,"" the letter said. The anonymous author said that value is 
extracted in numerous ways that are undetectable to staff audit efforts. One 
method included in the letter was for UtiliCorp employees to sell a first of 
the month ""put"" to suppliers, invoicing the put premium on a separate invoice 
that would never be included in audited documentation. If prices drop, the 
supplier puts first of the month gas to MPS. 

Another scheme alleged in the letter includes capacity releases. ""Operations 
personnel extract one-to-two cents per release by doing buy-sells with MPS 
capacity, instead of doing a posted release,"" said the letter. ""They look at 
the lowest credit amount possible to report, instead of maximizing the 
capacity release credit."" The anonymous author speculated that these actions 
are taken to reach the unit's lofty profit goal of $10 million. ""Due to the 
emphasis on earnings, GSS's top priority is earnings, not providing 
efficient, reliable, economic gas supplies,"" the author concluded. 

Jerry Cosley, a UtiliCorp United spokesperson said, ""We can say without 
qualification, that in no way would we approve of any improper behavior or 
business practice, so we are conducting our own review."" 

Missouri appears to be the first state out of the gate on the investigation 
trail as the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission has recommended 
an investigation be conducted into the allegations. An MPS representative 
said that UtiliCorp denied the allegations of impropriety, but supports the 
staff's request to open an investigation. 

Iowa's Consumer Advocate is investigating the UtiliCorp charges in that 
state, said Chuck Seel, a spokesman for the Iowa Utilities Board. Seel said 
the Iowa and Minnesota letters, and the Michigan and Missouri letters, 
appeared to be similar to one another. He added that an observer from the IUB 
and a representative of the Consumer Advocate will attend a meeting next week 
with UtiliCorp to discuss the situation. 

Cosley said UtiliCorp intends to conduct its own internal review, and would 
stay in touch with all of the affected regulatory commissions and report its 
findings to them.

793,"Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance

The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American 
gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western 
Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, 
PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the 
Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high 
load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge 
new rival for Western Canadian supply. 

""The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first 
of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the 
TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at 
about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly,"" said Klaus Exner, director 
of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. ""The big picture overview that 
I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and 
California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down 
that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and 
into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
letting up."" 

PG&E Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PG&E GT-NW has been 
running full at 2.6 Bcf/d for some time and is delivering 900 MMcf/d to 
non-California load in the Pacific Northwest. ""We're turning back demand 
right now. Every power plant in this region is running full tilt. Tuscarora 
[Gas Transmission], the Nevada pipeline, is full. Our Northwest deliveries 
are fixed. We're delivering as much as we can deliver right now."" 

TransCanada's other major export route out of the Western Canadian 
Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the 
Midwest. It also continues to operate at high load factors. ""We didn't see a 
huge drop-off in physical flows post Nov. 1. We've seen the IT volumes come 
up considerably,"" said Exner. ""The one thing that has changed is the 
volatility of the flows. Customers are making frequent intraday nomination 
changes and we're seeing more up and down and day-to-day variations, 
according to the weather and the markets, than we would have when we had a 
higher firm contract level. The fluctuations are driven purely by the price 
differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario, which indicates 
whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not."" 

Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running 
flat out at about 1.325 Bcf/d since the valves were opened for commercial 
service Dec. 1. He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase 
flows on the system. It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas 
flows to 1.5 Bcf/d with existing compression. The additional capacity would 
be divided up among existing shippers, Crawford said. ""We haven't cranked up 
the system above the contract capacity yet. We probably won't do that for a 
couple weeks until we get things ironed out. Frankly though, I'm not sure 
Chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the Pacific 
Northwest and California.""

805,"I reviewed the latest draft of AA's management rep. letter and caught a few  
innaccuracies in the way AA described the deal.  I attach a revised draft of 
the letter, with a redline version to highlight for you the changes I think 
we need to make to keep it accurate.  First, AA only listed two of the four 
agreements that comprise the deal.  They apparently forgot that we had 
created a second SBA.  Additionally, at Transcanada's request, we put the 
transaction fee into a separate letter agreement this year.  You will recall 
that last year, Sempra wanted the transaction fee put right in the SBA.  

Second, AA's bullet no. 4, as originally drafted, states that Northern does 
not intend to enter into an option to purchase any base gas during the term 
of the agreement.  That statement is confusing given that Article VI.B of the 
Monthly Pack Agreement includes an account balance cash out mechanism that is 
a form of purchase option.  That cash out mechanism was in Kent's bullets 
describing the deal and has been in every draft of the documents that AA 
looked at, so I assume they are OK with the mechanism and were just inartful 
in drafting bullet no. 4.   My simple fix was to leave AA's language alone 
but to add an ""except for"" reference at the beginning of bullet no. 4.    

Third, AA's draft of bullet nos. 5 and 6 includes the somewhat ambiguous 
references to ""other agreements"" and ""additional agreements"" respectively.   
Since AA's list of the agreements in the intro paragraph was incomplete, 
these references in bullet nos. 5 and 6 were also innacurate.  Now that I 
have made the list of agreements in the intro paragraph complete, I've 
clarified the bullets by adding the ""other than those agreements referenced 
above"" language to both bullets.  The couple of other changes in bullet 5 
simply clarify the meaning.  

Finally, I've modified the signature blocks per conversation with Bill to 
delete MKM and myself.  I am certainly willing and able to sign this letter, 
but MKM is not up to speed on the deal and has not reviewed the agreements.  
Getting her up to speed enough to sign the letter would take some time.  
Additionally, Bill's thought was that MKM and I are his direct reports 
anyway, so it doesn't serve much purpose to have the subordinates sign if the 
top guy has signed.   

Please give me a call if you have any questions or want to discuss these 
matters.

I just wanted to give you a heads up on this, since it will in the future 
have an impact on your groups.  We are in the process of working with IT to 
develop several enhancements to unify that will enable us to at first obtain 
the reports to more accurately book various types of deals such as storage 
and agency deals.   The second phase will be to automate unify so that the 
recording of the deals can move directly from unify to SAP.  The end goal is 
to have unify and the GL as close as possible mirror what is in sitara and 
the P&L, thus minimizing UAF and OA exposure.  

One of the items that is to be addressed during these enhancements is to have 
the desk associated with each of the deals in unify.  This will allow us to 
split pipelines across desks for end reporting uses just as we do in the 
P&L.  We are also hoping to move to a process where we will be settling on 
all of our desk to desk deals through the actualization process which will 
reduce the UAF exposure.  How this will impact your groups is that once we 
move to this phase, we will need to have all desk to desk deals be assigned a 
meter and pathed as a buy/sell so that these deals will flow into unify.  

I know that this will cause additional work on your end, so I wanted to give 
you at least some forewarning that this topic would be coming up over the 
next few  months  and as much preparation time as possible.  Please feel free 
to let me know of any concerns or ideas that you might have.  As I said 
before, we are only just now beginning talks with IT to develop these 
enhancements, so I would foresee that this will not be an issue for a month 
or two.  

Thanks for all your help!

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the 
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as 
possible.  This means using as few ""formula based"" curves as possible and as 
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or 
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but 
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating 
transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are 
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could 
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The 
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index 
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue 
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES 
business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using 
""formula based"" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport 
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and 
how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings 
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16
CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are 
two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which 
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other 
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more 
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.  
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads 
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know 
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it), 
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work 
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

Anything over that is taxed at 55%, but you are allowed deductions such as debts, probate fees, funeral expenses, and any state estate or inheritance taxes.  So the effective rate will be a little lower.  The increase to $1 million will not take effect until 2006.  This is very basic information, estate planning should be handled by a professional to minimize the tax liability.  Obviously, if the estate is not worth much money, then no taxes will be owed.

NYMEX BOARD EXTENDS PROPRIETARY FEE REDUCTION PROGRAM

At its meeting on March 7, 2001, the NYMEX Board of Directors determined to
extend the current Proprietary Fee Reduction Program (""Program"") through
April 30, 2001.

Pursuant to the Program, Member Firms and individuals members who own seats
will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 12 cents per round turn (6
cents per trade side).

Individual members who lease their seats, or hold a membership under an ABC
Agreement, will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 2.5 cents per
round turn (or 1 ? cents per trade side).

Clearing Members who clear Member Firm trades should adjust their billing
systems accordingly.

Clearing Members clearing floor members' accounts should not adjust their
billing systems for such individual members.  NYMEX issues payments
directly to individual members based upon their trading activity.

Floor members who execute Type 3 trades are asked to pay special attention
to NYMEX Rule 6.18 (B) (ii), requiring the executing member to report the
alpha code (badge symbol) of the receiving member on PTS.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to
contact M. Dawn Lowe or Donna Talamo at (212) 299-2370.

RE:
NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules

DATE:
May 8, 2001
===========================================================

This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two
post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.

!    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions
generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions
with two exceptions.

!    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be
two minutes long.

!    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five
minutes long.


End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)

As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please
be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments
to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule,
will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.

For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before
a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks


Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)

In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a
number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading
session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new
version of this rule is attached below.

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

(3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is
permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any
order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to
resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled
(GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for
purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market
participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session,
a new order must be submitted.

(4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer
participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on
PRS.

Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does
not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures
contracts.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading

Friday February 1, 2002
The last of the warm air will be scoured out of the East today with near to
below normal temperatures for most of the country by early next week. A
very active Southern jet stream could spin up two more significant winter
storms through next weekend.
From the looks of the models today, the pattern is about as active as it
gets. Imagine the possibilities if only there was more cold air in the mix.
While brutal air is still not expected, the potential for winter farther
South is on the increase next week. We will see a temporary break from the
storminess over the weekend. The current storm now in Pennsylvania will
move out to sea and drive colder air into the region. A cool and dry
weekend seems to be shaping up for most areas, but a weak low will drop out
of Canada, across the Lakes and toward New England on Sunday. The current
storm will probably drive out most of the available moisture, but some lake
effect is possible so some light snow amounts should occur. The next
Pacific wave comes ashore in a fairly harmless fashion initially. However,
the set up looks favorable for some sort of Low pressure to develop in the
vicinity of the Gulf coast early next week. It would head toward the SE US
and could be an interesting factor. As far as temperatures go, the high
pressure over the Western Plateau (Colorado and Utah) is keeping that
region in a trapped cold air mass. The Plains will slowly modify from the
current shallow arctic air in place while the East undergoes a rather
pronounced cooling to near if not slightly below normal levels, a far cry
from the record highs of the past two weeks.
The 6-10 day period looks colder for the nation as a whole than recent
weeks. I still don't see us bringing in any real brutal arctic air, but the
SE ridge that has been in place for much of January is no more. In all
cases, the models suppress the storm track to the Southern U.S. which opens
the door to another potentially major winter storm, but quite a bit farther
South than the last one. The solutions are all over the place which one
would expect this far out. One aspect that struck me as noteworthy was the
Canadian's depiction of a large arctic high over the Northern U.S. It has
had it for three runs in a row, but given the high surface pressures does
not look as cold as I would have expected. It's just another product of a
strange winter I suspect. So, while I still am not in any kind of arctic
camp on this, I do believe the areas of above normal temperatures will be
very limited. I look for most areas to run near or slightly below normal.
For the period Friday February 1 through Tuesday February 5, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Central and Southern Rockies, Southern
and Central Plains, Intermountain West, Desert SW, California...
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Northern Rockies, Pacific NW, Ohio and
Mississippi Valleys...
Average 1 to 3- degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Northeast..
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast, Southeast...

1026,"Congratulations to the ECP team - we signed the Transaction Agreement 
yesterday afternoon!  Thanks to everyone for their concerted efforts in 
bringing this transaction to this important milestone.


Financial close of the sale is dependent upon several factors - the most 
important of which are:

1.  Rating Agency reaffirmation of the rating on ECP's Senior Notes - both 
Moody's and S&P have indicated that they will announce reaffirmation upon our 
notification to them of the closing of the sale.

2.  ISRA certificate of non-applicability - This is the New Jersey 
environmental condition which according to our NJ counsel, LeBeouf, ""is on 
the last desk"".

3.  Minority partner consent at Bayonne - EPG wishes to complete a buyout of 
the remaining two minority interests which ECP does not own rather than 
obtain an explicit consent to our transaction.  We completely concur with 
this approach and have granted EPG (a) an incentive if financial close occurs 
this year - $500k price reduction, and (b) an extension to 22-Jan-01 of the 
maximum time allowed for financial close.  Though negotiations with Calpine, 
the largest minority partner at Calpine, are well advanced, it is certainly 
more likely that financial close will occur in early January than next week.

4.  Transition Services Agreement - We need to finalize the terms of and the 
specific services to be provided by ENA to ECP on behalf of EPG during a 
short transition phase beginning with financial close.

From time to time I will attempt to keep you informed of progress on these 
major items.  


Attached are two files summarizing:

(i) our estimate of 4Q00 P&L results assuming a sale of the SubNotes to 
Condor on 21-Dec and using an estimate of financial close on 27-Dec -   
""ECPmemotable_bka.xls"" (Please note - If financial close is delayed until

valuation date from 27-Dec to 31-Dec will actually increase P&L for the 
quarter), and 

(ii) an update to the overall transaction results and monetization 
sensitivities - ""epgofferanalysis (12-18-00)4Q.xls"" (Please note -  the 
estimate of 1Q01 P&L is slightly negative for offering costs associated with 
monetizing the swaps; however, under current market conditions it is quite 
possible that we could realize a monetization rate better than the forecast 
rate of 8.50% and more than sufficient to offset these expenses in their 
entirety).

Field to schedule signing for 2:00 PM, Thursday, 14-Dec at V&E's offices.  An 
amended DASH has been signed by RAC and is now making the rounds.  

In exchange for the slight reduction in price we obtained a minor credit 
spread protection agreement from EPG.  A term sheet describing the proposed 
terms of this agreement has gone over to El Paso today - see Lewis Worthy for 
any additional information you may require.  The maximum value of this 
agreement is $1mm and would be paid in the event credit spreads on El Paso 
debt widen in the market during the first quarter by approx. 18 bp - this 
represents 50% of the loss in value should such a move occur.  This minor 
addition to our agreement will be finalized over the next 45 hours prior to 
signing.

As to Bayonne consents, the Mission interest was acquired by ECP last week 
and EPG is attempting to accelerate pending negotiations to acquire the 
Calpine interest as the preferred way to resolve our consent issue.

Please be sure that you have completed all necessary/ongoing reviews by early 
Thursday.  Call me, Lisa, Chris or Lewis for any assistance you may require.

I assume that you are working Marsha's values into our analysis of Southern 
Co.'s rate from Zone .  The Southern Co./Sonat transportation contract has 
the following discount rate.  

 Term     Rate
 June 2004 - May 2007   .1973

 June 2012 - May 2017   GDP w/no cap not to exceed max rate of $.2663

Max Rate from Zone 1 to 2 is $8.10 or $.2663 which would be the absolute cap 
unless Sonat raised rates during the term of the Southern Co/Sonat contract.

accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report 
from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will 
be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the

The reason they are high is because they are not population weighted.  This makes a significant difference, looking at 10 cities at 100% versus population weighted, where all of the cities in a region add up to 100%.

If any month settles below $2.50, there is no payment due KCS for that reference month. Effectively the quantity becomes zero. above $2.50 it behaves like a regular swap.

this transactions should be booked from a risk perspective as three separate pieces:

1073,"Sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today

The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California 
Assembly.  The Republicans are currently in caucus until 3:30 PST and then 
will go to the floor for a vote.  The current situation is very fluid, but 
sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote, 
lacking the two-thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance.  If this is the 
case, the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be 
forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute 
financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely) 
Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem would then be the 
waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission 
line purchase or other assistance.

There is an outside chance that Republican defectors could precipitate from 
the current caucus.  There is extreme pressure on the Republicans from Davis 
and Angelides.  If the bill failed due to lack of Republican support, it 
would provide Davis the opportunity to blame Republicans for on-going 
expenditures of $70M/day (power purchases), and a possible bankruptcy by 
Socal.  The last Republican who gave support to a democratic bill (AB 1X), 
Representative Bill Campbell, lost his job.  Sources also confirm that 
Democrats have not met with Republicans on the bond issuance since last week.

1074,"With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced 
to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.

I am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and 
identifying any problems (i.e. penalty language, notification deadlines for 
OFOs, etc.) that may need to be addressed.  We have experienced a few 
problems with SW Gas Corp. recently.  They have been penalizing Enron for 
cuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month 
deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an 
interruptible contract and cannot be penalized.  This was news to me.  Can 
you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact 
business with our customers in the west?

I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west 
desk for some time.  Phillip Allen transferred the desk to me  in August of 
2000 and I have not spent the time to review all of contracts.  Let's get 
together and discuss exactly what I may need.

I went to see Richard this afternoon, and he's doing well.  They gave him
steroids last night, and within a few hours, much of the pain had subsided.
He hasn't needed morphine all day.

He is in good spirits, all things considered.  For example, I asked how he
was doing and he said ""Terrible!  All three of my fantasy football teams
lost, and I've got a tumor exploding in my head!""  He's being moved into
private room today, so personal visits, flowers, and phone calls will be
welcome.  The main number is 210-575-4040.  Just ask for Ernst.

As of today, the surgery is scheduled for Wednesday early afternoon.

Remember to say a prayer at noon tomorrow....that's UT (aka central) time,
for those of you who have moved away.

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

1105,"Dear John,

I had a meeting with Phillip after our morning discussion about P&L and it 
seems that there may be some issues regarding how I run my book.  It was my 
mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked 
properly.  The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners 
and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the 
options were not in my position.  Also, the tolls curves are not treated as 
schedule C.  I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift 
as needed.  My P&L did not match the Socal position because of physical index 
curveshift and an adjustment to transport.  

The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him 
concerns me.  I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and 
financial trading book within Enron.   I will stand on the fact that no one 
within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than 
I.  The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen 
at Enron since I have been here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go 
to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.  

I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it 
is responsible for communicating with you directly.  Let's get together and 
discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.   It 
may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until 
this point.  This may have contributed to my miscommunication with you.  I 
will see that this will not happen in the future.  Thank you for all of my 
added responsibilities.

Sincerely,

1109,"With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced 
to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

1123,"Group-

Last night there was a strategy that was implemented that needs some 
clarification.  We bought from EPE at PV and imported to the ISO.  We then 
did an SC trade (internal interchange) with WESCO in SP15.  When we do this, 
we do not want to adjust bid our import. If the import were to be cut due to 
congestion higher than our adjustment bid, we will be subject to replacement 
costs, which may be as much as the highest out of market energy price.  
However, if we send in the import without an adjustment bid, we are subject 
to a maximum of $250 per Mw.  This is potentially a substantial loss, but a 
least it is a known (and manageable) downside. In order to mitigate this risk 
of congestion, we can run a wheel in at Four Corners (with bid at $200) and 
out at Palo Verde (with bid of $150).  With both the import and the wheel for 
congestion relief, any congestion will be a wash and our only downside will 
be our transmission from PV to FC.

If this does not make complete sense, let me know and I will try to explain 
it further. 

Cheers

1141,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

",,NA
1154,"Mark, as we discussed, I see one of the growing legal risks for Canada (and 
perhaps elsewhere) resulting from ""retail"" deregulation and the pressure to 
increase transaction flow/market scope in energy markets by transacting 
behind and through the distribution company (or at ""point of delivery"").  
Although generally speaking this is described as ""retail"", it also affects 
""wholesale"" as (i) EWS will manage risk for EES, and (ii) the distinctions 
between ""retail"" and ""wholesale"" are not always clear (ex. depending on size 
and complexity, traders/originators in EWS will do ""point of delivery"" 
transactions).  

The risks tend to be additional to the customary commodity, price, legal and 
credit risk management in wholesale transactions, as they also involve: (i) 
volume/load balancing risk between the counterparty and the Disco, 
particularly for ""all requirements"", ""use"" or ""load following"" transactions 
and particularly where the balancing obligation between the counterparty and 
the Disco is ""unhedged"" or ""mismatched"" (ex. balancing with the counterparty 
for excess or unused volumes may be at daily index on the date of 
consumption, whereas balancing with the Disco may be at the monthly index for 
the next month based on actual, estimated or aggregated data); (ii) terms and 
conditions/tariff risk to the Disco (ex. the distribution terms and 
conditions/tariffs pass a number of risks on to the commodity supplier, such 
as obligations to continue delivery after counterparty default or 
termination, options to the Disco to source supply after default or 
termination, broad third party indemnifications to the Disco for conduct of 
the counterparty, allocation of force majeure risk (that may differ from the 
counterparty agreement); (iii) additional or incremental credit obligations 
to the Disco; and (iv) pressure in these markets to used more simplified 
(often government regulated) non-master contract forms - although the forms 
used tend to be more unilateral to the commodity supplier.

The mitigant is to understand clearly both the formal and practical market, 
rules, requirements, procedures, regulations and distribution terms and 
conditions applicable to delivering the commodity behind and through the 
Disco, if possible to get involved in shaping those in a proactive way 
through the deregulation process, and developing risk management procedures 
around the formal and practical requirements of the market.

For your risk memo you could briefly describe the risk as:  ""Point of 
Delivery Risk (retail or wholesale) for energy commodities behind and through 
the Distribution Company, including balancing commodity use between the Disco 
and the customer, distribution tariff/terms and conditions risks, incremental 
credit obligations between wholesale markets and the Disco, and commercial 
and regulatory requirements for contracting.""

Top Legal Risks

1.  Power Forms -  Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak.  
Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated 
damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination 
damages, broad performance outs.

2. Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent 
acting on behalf of several operating companies. This creates uncertainty as 
to which entity is liable for which trades.

3. Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities.

4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a 
result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing.

5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on 
a very tight time schedule.

6. Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on 
how to document transactions involving power.

7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure 
everybody understands risks associated with transactions.

Documentation Projects

1.  EEI - cont'd work to make EEI the trading contract for power/lessen 
reliance on WSPP.

2.  One-off Power Form - creation of contract to be used for individual 
transactions that are not part of a master.

3. Product Definition - cont'd work on creating/building acceptance for power 
product definitions.

4. Platform Trading - Encourage use of EEI as trading platform for all 
e-trading.

5. Single master contract for all physical commodities/financial trading  -  
work with ISDA to develop single contract for physical trading and then roll 
that into single contract for physical and financial trading",,,WSPP ISDA

Vicki Sharp, John Klauberg and I had a short call on Sunday to discuss any 
legal issues associated with the proposed accounting treatment of certain of 
transactions between EPMI and EES.

1. EPMI has requested that the economics of the Assigned Transactions (the 
PGET transactions assumed by EPMI and referred to in the December 28, 2000 
letter between EPMI and EEMC) be held by EPMI, and not retained by EEMC as 
provided by the letter agreement.

Wes, could you confirm that EPMI wishes to assume the economics of those 
transactions effective 1/1/2001?  I have assumed that this is the case, and 
have drafted an amendment to the December 28 letter accordingly (attached 
below).  Please review and let me know if this is something we can work with 
(note that the draft letter may need revisions based upon resolutions of 
other issues raised in this e-mail).  We will also need to confirm that there 
are no undesirable tax or bankruptcy implications to this approach.

One element of the assignment of the ""Regulatory Receivable"" and the 
assignment to EPMI of the PGET trades that we have questions regarding is the 
apparent lack of consideration flowing back to EEMC/EES as a result of these 
transactions -- we will have transferred some fairly substantial assets from 
EEMC/EES to EPMI, but have made no provision for those entities receiving 
anything in exchange.  The December 28 letter did make reference to the 
possibility of ""back-to-back"" transactions between EPMI and EEMC, which may 
answer that questions with respect to the assignment of the PGET trades, but 
if we are going to go that route, we would need to work out the terms of 
those ""back-to-back"" transaction by which EPMI sells the power that it 
purchases from PGET/Avista to EEMC to enable EEMC to fill its short position. 
For instance, at what price would EPMI resell the PGET/Avista power to EEMC 
so that EEMC can supply the requirements of its Direct Access Customers?  If 
the transfer price is at market, EEMC will recognize a significant loss on 
sales to its DACs.

2. On January 17, 2001, EES and EEMC assigned certain of their ""Regulatory 
Receivables"" to EPMI.  The assignment was intended to be an absolute transfer 
and true sale of EEMC/EES' rights in those receivables, but the Assignment 
Agreement does not recite any consideration for that transfer.  Again, we 
assume that the transfers of those receivables would leave a  ""hole"" in EES' 
books that, in an arms-length transaction, would be filled by the 
consideration that EES/EEMC received for the sale.  Has there been any 
conversation about the benefits that may ultimately flow back to EES/EEMC in 
consideration for their transfer of these receivables to EPMI?  While the 
attached amendment is not intended to address the assignment of that 
receivable, it may be beneficial to make reference to those benefits in this 
amendment.     

3. The January 17, 2001 assignment transferred that portion of the negative 
CTC that had accrued to date, but we have not effected any transaction to 
transfer the risk of the remaining marked position to EPMI.  There was some 
discussion of an EES/EPMI ""swap"" that would transfer the risk in the 
remaining position to EPMI.  Is that still being contemplated?

1175,"We  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on Sunday night.  The main points are:  

     1. Rationing losses:   Defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from June 01 until the end of rationing in 02. Recovery includes financial compensation. Immediate funding of 80% through BNDES, with Brazilian government funds. Loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  Funding scheduled by December 15th.  Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R$191million or US$ 73 million.

       2.  April/May MAE settlement :   Market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on Elektro's books.  Impact of approximately R$ 18 million or US$ 7 million. 

       3.  Parcel  ""A"" for the future:  All non-controlable costs to which LDC's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the LDC tariff revision date.  Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. Elektro Ebitda impact  2002 forward of R$ 60 million or US$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.

        4. Parcel A from the past:   Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney General's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    Elektro impact  is R$145 million or US$ 55 million in 2001. The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.  

We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.

Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  These  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool.  

Total amounts for the sector represent about R$ 10 billion or US$3.8 billion at the current rates.  Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.

RE: NOx SIP Call Implementation - Draft EPSA Letters to Michigan
                and North Carolina Attached
? Comments Due By Wednesday, April 4th, Close of Business

Most of the 19 states subject to the NOx-SIP Call rule have submitted draft 
or final plans to revise their state implementation plans (SIPs) to meet the 
rule's emission-reduction requirements.  U.S. EPA is in various stages of 
reviewing and taking action on the plans.  It is expected that Northeastern 
states' plans will generally be acted upon first since they were among the 
first to be submitted.

North Carolina and Michigan are both in the process of finalizing their plans 
for implementing the NOx SIP-Call rule.  Both of their rules, as currently 
drafted, contain approaches of particular concern to merchant suppliers.  
Specifically, both feature provisions that could limit significantly the 
number of allowances available to new generating facilities.

EPSA has drafted comments to these states advocating more reasonable 
approaches, which will be more likely to ensure sufficient allowances to 
support capacity additions.  A copy of the drafts is attached for review.  
Please provide any comments on the letter to Samantha Slater at (202)

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

Legal is reviewing the contract at this time and hopes to finish next week.  
Yesterday I was notified that the guaranteed revenues from the transportation 
agreement may be raised by $5,000 to $10,000 due to revised sizing 
requirements of  the TBS as requested by NSP.  

We have had several meetings with operations to ensure that the facilities 
that are included in the sale are correct.  Also, the O&M savings are the 
estimates given by the field.  Based on average costs for similar facilities 
the expected O&M savings would be between $6K and $8k. The field has 
indicated however because of the encroachment that they receive a large 
number of line locate requests each year for these branchlines which drives 
up the O&M costs.  My expectations are that we would save closer to $10k in 
O&M costs rather than the $20k.

In addition, regulatory reminded me today that there is still a farm tap 
issue that has to be cleared up before the sale.  All farm taps receiving 
service from these branchlines must be disconnected and service provided by 
another utility prior to the sale.  The latest estimate that I received was 
that this would be completed by the end of the year.

1229,"At our Market Services Council meeting today I promised I would send around 
the Project Why information we have pulled together concerning the Activities 
and Tasks associated with each function within Market Services. Below is the 
current draft of Activities and Task associated with ET&S Gas Control. The 
other functions of Scheduling, Invoice/Billing, Contracts, and Electronic 
Business Development will be forwarded shortly. Since there are activities 
and tasks that involve areas outside of Market Services, I will be working 
with folks from TW/NNG Marketing (Lindy Donoho, Steve Gilbert, Jane Joyce), 
Finance (Dan Fancler), Business Consultant (Steve Klimesh), IT, and 
Regulatory.

The direction that I have given to my direct reports within Market Services 
on the scope of this phase of Project Why (as reflected in the draft 
attachment below) is as follows:
1. Identify the Activities and Tasks associated with Market Services 
functions (SEE Column 1 in attachment below),
2. Identify the Market Service function(s) responsible and/or other 
departments involved in this Activity/Task (SEE Column 2),
3. Identify the frequency of this Activity/Task (SEE Column 3),
4. Identify whether the Activity/Task is manual/semi-automated/automated (SEE 
Column 4),
5. The remaining columns(5,6 &7) in the attachment would be discussed later. 

I realize we discussed modifications to the format used below at today's 
meeting but I have not incorporated such changes yet. I am willing to discuss 
further so call with questions. More to come.

Thanks. Julia

1233,"Peggy asked that I update you on our earnings forecast for this year.

PGE had an exceptional April with PGE IBIT of $39.8 million compared to $5.2
million budget and Net Income of $20.9 million compared to -$.7 million plan. 
Earnings for the month were driven primarily by our wholesale business and
outstanding plant operations.  Actual net variable power cost for April came
in at $.2 million compared to our budget of$43.9 million.  Retail loads were
off for the month which created additional length along with strong wholesale
prices in the preschedule and real time markets.  

April results do not include any charges for Enron overheads which we would
expect to start occurring in May.  Kirk Stevens and Mark Lindsey are working
on getting these charges allocated to PGE.

For Q2, our Current Forecast for PGG is to over perform at plan by $1.7
million IBIT and 6.3 net income.  The primary driver will still be power cost
for May and June.   Recent downward movement in the forward curve has reduced
the value of our long position in May and June on a forecast basis.  However,
the preschedule and real time markets continue to be strong.  If this trend
continues then we should over perform in both May and June.  How much is still
highly dependent on wholesale prices, our plant operations, retail loads and
weather conditions in the West.  

For the year, we are still on track to make our plan but a similar situation
to the second quarter exists for us in the third and fourth quarter.  We are
holding on to some length in our retail book to hedge our retail load and
plant operations.  The value of that length changes on a forecast basis based
upon movement in the forward curve.  However, we continue to see the
preschedule and real time market trade higher than the forward curve.  In
addition, as we discussed before, we have a regulatory mechanism in place
where by we share our overall net variable power cost with customers.  Our
current power cost forecast has us in the 90 / 10 sharing bandwidth with
collection of about $18 million from customers.  If wholesale prices in the
preschedule and real time market continue to be strong then we will move into
the dead band and could move into the refund zones.   In addition to power
cost,  we put in place a goal this year of reducing O&M by 7% from the budget
and we are on target to meet this goal.

1234,"We are in the process of closing with US Bank on our financing for the
construction of the first phase of this project for $13 million.  We are
working with the Enron Corp. - Corporate Financing group to obtain a corporate
guarantee for the financing.  This project is currently in PGH2 and is part of
what is being sold with PGE.  The financing guarantee will contemplate this
sale and will allow for the assignment of the guarantee to the new buyer as
long as they meet an agreed upon financial standards (ie. BBB+).  Since we are
under ETS you or Stan might get questions on the project and I wanted to
provide you an overview of the project.

Mahendra Shah of our treasury group has had a conversation with Greg Caudell
and Jim Newgard (both report to Tm Despain) at Enron Corp. Corporate Finance
about the Enron Guaranty for the US Bank construction facility (up to $13
million). He has forwarded to them, the US bank's draft of the Enron guaranty.
 They indicated that the guaranty would probably be redrafted by Clement
Abrams using the standard Enron format.  
 
If you have any questions on the District Cooling Project or need additional
information we can set up a conference call and go over the various aspects of
the project.  We also have the financial model available that we can forward
to you that was reviewed and was the basis of Enron's approval.","BBB+ Stan Mahendra Shah Greg Caudell

1235,"The following is an update on PGG earnings for the 2nd quarter and our ability
increase our EBIT for PGG from our last current estimate of 58 million to at
least 62 million.  I talked with Kirk Steven's this afternoon and after
looking at our preliminary closing estimates for power cost for May, our June
current estimate of power cost, and the amount of overview (25 million) we had
targeted for the second quarter here is what we concluded based upon the
assumption that prices for June do not continue to degrade from current levels
like they have over the last month.

Current Estimate Provided to Enron for Q2                   58  million
Power Cost & O&M Improvement > Overview               10  million
Catchup on Enron Allocations                                     (  3) million
Total EBIT                                                                    
65  million

There are two sensitivities to this estimate that could lower this number by a
combined 6.5 million.  

First we understand that we may be allocated charges for the Tomas transaction
that ran through the PGG books last year.  We reserved 1.8 million last year
and we understand the total charges from GATX could be as much as $5.1
million.  We did not include anything in our targets or plan for additional
charges since this transaction was originated in Houston.  

Second we have incurred $3.2 million in costs associated with supply chain
software associated with the sale of PGE to Sierra.  We will have to write-off
these costs in the second quarter since the software would only have value in
a peoplesoft system environment.  We have had good discussions with Bob Butz
about Enron covering these costs with some of the money they received from
Sierra to terminate the transaction.  We will need to resolve this in the 2nd
quarter or take the write-off which would reduce our EBIT.

In addition, as we have communicated before with you, we still have an open
long power position in June and all of the third quarter for reliability
purposes which will continue to cause our earnings to be volatile.  Recently
power curves in the west have been trading down but we would expect them to
rise as the warm weather comes on and loads in California increase.  There
have been some structural changes in the California market that could tend to
dampen the price curves for this summer.  

We will continue to keep you informed on what changes we are seeing as we go
through June in terms of meeting the 2nd Quarter adjusted current estimate
EBIT numbers discussed above.  If you have any questions or would like to
discuss this further feel free to call me at 503-464-8982.","Kirk Steven's Tomas Bob Butz

tomorrow with Stan Horton regarding PGG's expected financial results for Q3. 
More specifically, I laid out a plan as to how we might cover our current
overview gap of $19.5m (IBIT) from where our latest forecast came out.  As you
will see, several of these items will need to get AA&Co buy-in (items noted as
either Accouting Changes or Changes in Management Position).  I think we have
a good case for all of these, but we still need to go through the process with
them at the appropriate time.

In addition, I've note ""Other Risks/Opportunities"" for the quarter that could
have significant impacts on our ultimate results.  We will keep an eye on
these and manage them as appropriate.  We'll also try to keep you updated on
these as we progress through the Qtr.

1238,"Rod,

Listed below is one of the items that I have been trying to get a hold of you
on.  The others can wait until you have a few minutes.


We have spent some time reviewing the allocation of our VaR and net open
position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to
better match the limits and their objectives to our trading activity and
portfolio.

1.  VaR:  Given that we are a naturally short utility and do not hedge our
long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons we
would like to  reallocate $500k of our regulated electric VaR to our regulated
natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR
to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of our natural
short position in the back-end of our reporting period. After reducing our
electric VaR we will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated
electric portfolio.

2. NOP:  After changing our regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary
to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently we have been using a
10 Bcf limit for our NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR we recalculated
 the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.

I have reviewed these changes with Vlady and he has concurred with my proposed
changes.  In our conversation he recommended that in addition to reviewing
these changes with you that I also run them by Rick Buy.  It was my intent to
review these changes with you but I was surprised by having to review these
changes with Rick.  It was my understanding that once an allocation of VaR was
made to a business unit that it is within the business units preview to
reallocate that VaR as needed to met business unit objectives.  If the
business process has changed I will be glad to contact Rick and review these
changes with him.  Its your call so please let me know your preference.

1243,"There has been no major concerns.  Jo Williams wanted to revise the marketing flow chart to show that either the marketing vp, pricing desk or trader will initiate a decision to enter into a position.  I did specify in this draft that the head trader would review, approve and sign off on the Daily Position and P&L Reports after the close of each business day.  

There are some main differences in the way Caminus calculates VaR and the way Enron Corp. calculates VaR.  These differences include:

-	Enron Corp. uses approximately 60 buckets of time while Caminus is limited to 12 buckets of time
-	ETS loads in the price curves every night while Enron Corp. usually loads the curves every two weeks.  Right now Enron Corp.'s VaR models are being revised and it is difficult to see how far off we are.  With respects to correlations, we are really close on all except for those related to San Juan and Socal.  
-	Enron Corp. use implied volatility while Caminus uses historical volatilities.  

Vernon Mercaldo is working with me to find why there is a difference in correlations with San Juan and Socal.

Rebecca and I (along with John Garrison) actually were discussing the Wessex 
situation and your important contribution Wednesday.  We really appreciate 
the effort, and hope to keep you involved as and when this goes forward.

Earlier this week Sir Ian Byatt announced he would not approve the Kelda deal 
in its current structure.  His complaints were principally about 
mutualization, though he had some reservations about how they would address 
independence in the asset/operations separation--mostly related to keeping 
the responsibility on AssetCo for drinking water and environmental quality.  
Merrill Lynch thinks this will push the process back a few months, as Kelda 
redraws and the new regulator (a life-long bureaucrat) cautiously moves into 
his new role.  

I suspect we will try to reorganize the business more formally along these 
lines, but may be holding off on detailed work on the contracts for a 
while--assuming our board would prefer us to be the second company to go 
through this, not the test case.  We'll know more after the dust settles on 
the recent Ofwat announcement and our board meeting on August 7.

As for expenses, I leave that to Michael, but I imagine it would be easier if 
you processed the info and sent a single bill to AZX.  Thanks.

information, credit card information has not been transferred. You will need to
update your profile.

Your Itineraries
Information in your Saved Itineraries created on or before May 30 will not be
transitioned.  If you want to keep a copy for your records, print them prior to
6 p.m. CDT, May 30. This change does not affect the status of any reservations
and tickets, just your ability to view them in the new eService Online.

Signing In
To enhance security, you will have to sign in for each transaction session to
reserve and purchase flights. This means you will have to use your password each
time. To have your password e-mailed to you visit

You are strongly encouraged to sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging
process.

24-Hour Hold Option
To prepare for next Wednesday's release, we will turn off the ""Hold for 24
hours"" option. The ""Hold"" option will not be available between May 25 and May
30.

Here Are Some of the Changes

More eTicketing
The new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets
(eTickets). We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by
Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West Airlines
(CO2000-2349).

Aircraft Seat Maps
We rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat
selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating.

Pricing
The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on your
selection of either ""Search By Lowest Fares"" or ""Search By Schedule."" We also
added a gold star to denote ""continental.com promotional fares,"" so you know for
certain when you receive a discounted, online-only airfare.

Customer Service
Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now
handle all support for online inquiries and reservations services.

While we've made a number of improvements to the overall experience, this new
version may not, on the surface, appear to be significantly different.  These
changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the
future.  We welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  Based on
feedback from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.

We're confident you will appreciate the changes and improvements and we look
forward to continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,

Continental Airlines, Inc.

Harassment Avoidance Training

To contribute our personal best at Enron, our conduct must promote respectful and co-operative work relationships.

During this training you will:
Be able to recognize harassment
Learn to take precautions against being harassed
Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
Know how to address a situation involving harassment
Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with Enron Values

Go to <http://elm.enron.com> to sign up for the session of your choice.  Harassment Avoidance is listed in the Compliance Category.  If you have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713-853-0357.

The date and times available for sessions are:


Day	Date	Session I	Session II	Session III	
Wednesday	Sept 19	1:30 - 2:45	3:00 - 4:15	4:30 - 5:45

We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

I am an Enron Wholesale Services attorney who is advising on ENA gas transportation matters.  Elizabeth Sager suggested that I contact you about assisting me with the preparation of a Motion to Reject the bulk of the executory transportation service agreements that ENA has with interstate pipeline companies.  

The attached spreadsheet summarizes the terms of said transportation agreements; please note that the first sheet of the spreadsheet file describes the 5 transportation contracts that ENA wishes to assume; the remainer are out of the money transportation and storage arrangements that ENA desires to reject.  Please review the attached and let me know if it contains sufficient information with which to proceed with the preparation of the Motion.  

I imagine you will have plenty of questions. . . . I myself have a number of questions regarding the agency relationships shown on the spreadsheet, as well as ENA's right or need to reject those Service Agreements under which ENA has heretofore released pipeline capacity to third parties.  

I look forward to speaking with you about these matters as well as determing the timeframe for rejecting these contracts.

 2000 Base Operating Income Target  $147.4 Million

 2000 Current Estimate Base Operating Income $154.8 Million

Through June of 2000, in our Base Operating Income we were able to cover our 
original stretch of $2.9Million, 
as well as a Sale of Assets shortfall of $2.6 Million, resulting in our 
exceeding our Base Operating Income Target 
by a net amount of $1.9 Million.

We will now put into place a plan to cover the incremental stretch of at 
least $2.9 Million for 2000.  Our revised 2000 Consolidated Net Income Target 
is now $89.4 Million.  We will be meeting in the next few days to develop and 
implement our strategy to attain this target.  I will advise you of the

As you may have noticed EOTT shares have been trading down over the past 
several days (Friday's close was 12 3/4 vs. today's close of 11 7/8).  Some 
of the weakness may be related to concern over the Midland pipeline leak that 
occurred several weeks ago.  A message was posted on the Yahoo message board 
on 2/11 noting the EOTT has recently had ""a couple of BAD pipeline leaks in 
West Texas/New Mexico"".  I did not recieve any questions on the Midland leak 
until today.  In addition, Jeanine Kim with PaineWebber (Ron Barone's 
analyst) called today and indicated they had several calls on the leak and on 
the reported loss of one of EOTT's top traders in Midland.

I have not had any other calls pointing to other rumors that might explain 
the weakness.

The volumes traded over the last several days does not appear unusual, with 
today's volume reported at 44,400 units.

1320,"There are a number of superb initiatives that are being developed and 
implemented 
throughout EOTT that will collectively profoundly change and improve our 
company.
I will give you periodic updates on these initiatives throughout the year.

As an example, Priscilla Norton is doing excellent work to develop more 
accurate and 
appropriate truck cost guides.  This tool is giving us much better knowledge 
about the
true cost to transport crude oil in specific areas across our systems.  As in 
most 
everything we do, this is a real team effort.

I have asked Priscilla to briefly describe this tool and it implementation 
below:
=============================================================

""I developed the Fleet TIME Tool  because I wanted to allocate costs as 
accurately as possible to the individual lease level.   In the past fleet 
cost allocation was based on district averages allocated based primarily on 
miles.   The TIME Tool differs from past practice because it uses actual 
truck hours spent on every EOTT truck haul.  A district cost per hour is then 
established based on number of truck-hours operated in each district, and 
total fleet operating dollars spent in each district.  Using the hourly 
district rate, the Tool calculates district cost per barrel for each ticket 
based on actual truck time consumed.  The resulting data is vital information 
because even though we may already know a district averages 70 cents per 
barrel, we will now know which leases are $0.45 per barrel and which are 
$1.10 per barrel. This improved understanding of actual cost per barrel at 
the lease level paves the way for a much better understanding of lease 
profitability.   With this information, Marketing  can become more 
aggressive, competitive, and confident about our costs when bidding on new 
barrels, and Operations Managers can more easily identify opportunities to 
optimize fleet costs.  

The Fleet District Managers and Marketing have been receptive to the TIME 
concept  and very helpful in providing feedback.    Although the concept of 
TIME as our key cost driver is still in its infancy, Marvin Mills is already 
using the information to identify opportunities to reduce his costs in 
Kansas.    Willie Seale and Phil Elliot  have been using TIME data to 
identify Stations where EOTT could bid the barrels out at a lower cost than 
EOTT's internal cost, and to identify marginal leases to be rebid or 
terminated.     Bennie Orr has been using the TIME philosophy when 
Ark-La-Tex  bids on new business because the Tool has convinced him that 
mileage, by itself  is not a true indicator of cost.  Our biggest struggle 
right now is just getting adequate timely data to meet our needs.

With the help of Patrick Scales, the TIME Tool is currently being moved to a 
server platform using the new Brio software.  Eventually the Tool should 
allow us to have near real-time data at our finger tips.   Future plans 
include adding pipeline barrels and tariff rates to the Tool in order to be 
able to see both pipeline and truck business in the same tool (essential for 
analyzing customers who have both pipeline and truck barrels).  Within the 
next week, we plan to roll the Server version of the TIME Tool out to at 
least one outlying office to begin testing functionality and accuracy, and to 
identify any performance issues.  

Our goal is that the TIME Tool move EOTT to a much greater understanding of 
cost/profitability at the lease level.""

1329,"TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.

The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  

Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .

TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:
	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;
	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.


Items to Verify:
 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral
 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)


Opportunities for TW:
By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.

 Regarding their first point, we should only guarantee amounts that are 
covered by our contracts.  Non contract amounts should not be subject the the 
guarantee, incoming or outgoing.  
 Remember that we need to keep the guaranty amounts specific as to each enron 
entity.  This is because the part that pertains to Houston Pipe Line Company 
will need to be deleted from the guaranty and a separate guaranty from HPL's 
new parent will need to take its place.  
 Somehow we need them to accept buyin on the fact that the new guarantee will 
not be effective until the old guaranty has been superceded, even if this

The basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices. It is called 
Basisnw7.xls and is in the ERG database.
It looks to be working correctly, but of course without data it is a little 
hard to confirm.  As always, it is ultimately your job to verify that the 
numbers reported are correct.  Lemme know if there are problems.  

It is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year.  You should keep 
this mail message as a reference.
1)  Add 12 to the expression in ""PrintMacro""!B35 i.e. change 
COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+63,i,12,1)) to 
COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+75,i,12,1))

2) Define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be 
printed out on the report page.  For example, last year, the basis report 
went from Jan 93 to Dec 1999. In Basisnw6.xls there is a name ""Jan93"" defined 
as ""Basis""!A64 (i.e. refers to the row where the Jan 1993 basis numbers are 
recorded).  This year, in Basisnw7.xls, I defined  ""Jan94"" to refer to 
""Basis""!A76.  That's because the basis report will now run from Jan 1994 to 
Dec 2000.

3)  Change the expression in ""PrintMacro""!B45 to use this new cell reference 
i.e.  change COPY(OFFSET(Jan93,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1)) to 
COPY(OFFSET(Jan94,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1))

4) Having executed steps 1) - 3) the spreadsheet will now print numbers 
shifted up by one year.  All that remains to do is to change the dates on the 
""PrintFormat"" page to be one year more.  By that I mean change 1998 to 1999, 
1999 to 2000, change 98/99 to 99/00, etc.  Don't move any numbers or formulas!


That's it.  As we discussed Bhavna, while I am happy to do this for you, it 
is not in your or my best interest for this to continue.  Please do work to 
find some one in your shop to maintain this spreadsheet.


Regards, and Happy New Year!

Candidate 2: No real Investment Banking/Energy risk experiences...but, asked 
me to get him out in London as he and his wife lived/worked there for FORD

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook

A Measurement  Framework for Bank Liquidity Risk

Vice President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond  Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based  consulting firm offering financial management solutions that 
combine advisory  and systems development services to &corporations and 
financial  institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity risk, as opposed to credit and  market risks, has received little 
attention in professional or academic  journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk can be viewed as a  variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure.  The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration of the  liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

1477,"At its special meeting today, FERC released the results of its eagerly 
awaited probe into California's summer power crisis, concluding that under 
certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and 
unreasonable power rates due to California's ""seriously flawed"" market 
structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions 
throughout the West.

The FERC staff report on western markets and the causes of the Summer 2000 
Price Abormalities, entitled, Part I of Staff Report on U.S. Bulk Power 
Markets, is available at the following website: 
http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm

In response, FERC issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural 
changes to the California ISO and PX to help remedy the pricing problems, and 
solicited public comment by November 22.  A technical conference has also 
been scheduled for November 9, to discuss the proposed solutions and other 
remedies that might be suggested (details TBA).  While all four commissioners 
supported the order, the order stretched the Commission.  Chairman Hoecker 
and Comm. Breathitt expressed strong endorsements, while Comms. Hebert and 
Massey concurred, citing areas where they felt the Commission had either 
""over-reached"" or not gone far enough, as discussed below.  A final order is 
expected to be issued by year's end.

At the same time, the Commission warned California consumers of their 
continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve 
state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability of day 
ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand responses; (3) 
siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of sufficient 
reserve requirements.

Highlights of Proposed California Structural Remedy

In its order, FERC proposed a series of market overhauls, including:

(1) Eliminating the state's mandatory requirement that the state's 
investor-owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allowing
these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other 
alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks.

(2) Requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their 
transactions in the day-ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for 
under-scheduling (in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements), in 
order to discourage over-reliance on the real-time spot market.

(3) Establishing independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the ISO 
and PX.

(4) Modifying the current single price auction system by (a) imposing a 
temporary $150/MWh ""soft cap"" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $150 
from setting the market-clearing price for all bidders; (b) requiring sellers 
bidding above $150/MWh to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, weekly 
basis and provide certain cost support; and (c) requiring the ISO and PX to 
report monthly information on such bids.  The Commission's price mitigation 
measures would remain in effect through December 31, 2002.

(5) Declining to order retroactive refunds for the state's ratepayers and 
utilities, citing insufficient authority to do so, but subjecting sellers to 
potential refund liability for transactions from October 2, 2000 until 
December 21, 2002, but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs, if 
FERC finds non-competitive behavior.

(6) Encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand 
response management programs.

Separately, the draft order rejected the ISO's request for an extension of 
its current purchase price cap authority, and the PX's request for price 
capping authority.

Commissioner Responses

Comm. Herbert reluctantly concurred, noting that his decision may change when 
a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at 
the November 9 meeting.  He stressed that he would have preferred that the 
order address four areas: (1) eliminate all price controls in California 
markets; (2) abolish the single price auction entirely; (3) terminate the 
""buy and sell"" mandate in the PX; and (4) direct the ISO to address a long 
list of cited problems in its January 2001 RTO filing, rather than having the 
Commission prescribe specific remedies.

Hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the ""soft cap"" 
concept, if one had to be adopted, then the soft cap should increase 
incrementally increase over time at specific pre-announced dates.  He 
believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in 
facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive 
for California regulators to address market design and other flaws.  Also, he 
would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time, but 
allow the ISO and PX to address this issue in their January 2001 RTO 
filings.  In addition, he would not dictate risk management methods, 
preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on 
their own.  Finally, he advised Californians not to be so environmentally 
focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation 
capacity.

Comm. Breathitt stated her approval of the Order while warning that FERC 
cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress 
towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that it was the Commission's 
job to guide the market to self-correct and not to conduct ""command and 
control.""  She also commended the managers of the ISO and PX, saying that 
they have performed admirably.  However, she noted she is awaiting comments 
on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential 
reporting requirements.

Comm. Massey concurred, but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive 
approach.  He feels that the Congress has ""put its thumb on the scale"" in the 
Federal Power Act to protect consumers.  Stating that prices will continue to 
be unreasonable in the future, he believes that this Order moves in the right 
direction, by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over 
reliance on the spot market, lack of demand response, the need to 
reconstitute governance of the ISO and PX and the elimination of the buy/sell 
mandate.  Comm. Massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the 
$150/MWh soft cap went far enough, whether FERC has the legal authority to 
issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a 
certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market 
price volatility.

Finally, Chairman Hoecker stated his strong support of the Order, but noted 
that this is ""no time to pull punches.""  He emphasized that the Commission 
needed frank comments from the industry.  He echoed Comm. Breathitt's warning 
that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on 
track.  Noting that the Commission lacked authority to order refunds, he 
stated that the responsibility rests with Congress.  Addressing 
jurisdictional issues, he stated that siting problems encountered at the 
state level are slowing the ""meandering transition"" to competition.  He feels 
that the state of California and FERC need to work together to resolve these 
problems and that FERC is not attempting to usurp power.  Rather, California 
is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region 
for reliable energy, thus placing the burden on federal action to make things 
work, Hoecker maintained.  The Chairman also said that the Commission will 
fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further 
evidence provided by staff's ongoing investigation.

1487,"Everyday heroes are all around us at Enron, living our core values of 
Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence in everything they do.  Some 
of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference 
in the workplace around them.  Either way, these special individuals deserve 
to be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 Chairman's Award.

As there is more than just one employee living the values at Enron, this 
award program will honor 10 employees as members of the Chairman's 
Roundtable.  From that group, the one individual most embodying our values 
will be presented with the Chairman's Award at the Management Conference in 
San Antonio in November.

The beauty of this award program is that it is completely employee-driven 
from beginning to end.  From your nominations, an international employee 
committee will select the Chairman's Roundtable and eventually, the 
Chairman's Award winner.  Your role of nominating our everyday heroes is 
extremely vital to the program's success.  If someone has made a positive 
impression on you, please take the time to complete a nomination form and 
send it to Charla Reese by October 1, 2000.  You may click here for a

Powergen and LG&E Complete Merger
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Powergen of the United Kingdom and LG&E Energy Corp. of Louisville, Ky.,
have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations. LG&E
will maintain its headquarters in Louisville, which will serve as the=20
headquarters
for Powergen's North American operations. LG&E Energy's utility subsidiarie=
s,
Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company, will continue
as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with=20
headquarters
in Louisville and Lexington, Ky., respectively.

ANALYSIS: Although referred to as a ""merger,"" Powergen actually has acquire=
d
LG&E, a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all
three core sectors of the electric utility business (generation, transmissi=
on
and distribution). Powergen, which generates about 14 percent of the=20
electricity
used in England and Wales, is a company with clear intentions to expand
internationally. The company currently has electric and gas operations
in Europe, India, Asia and Australia. Together, the Powergen / LG&E=20
combination
reportedly will have assets of nearly $14 billion and total revenues of
$9 billion, serving four million customers worldwide.

The partnership marks the third acquisition of a U.S. electric utility
by a foreign company, following ScottishPower's purchase of PacifiCorp
and National Grid's purchase of the New England Electric System (NEES),
both in 1999. It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition
of a U.S. utility, the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have
become easier to pass.

Powergen's reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise
from needs similar to its U.K. counterparts. In the last ten years that
have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of=20
electricity
in the United Kingdom, the electric sector has become completely competitiv=
e
in all areas, including domestic customers. Just as in U.S. deregulation,
concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of U.K.
companies, which is compounded by the limited size of the U.K. energy marke=
t.
Consequently, companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both
in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through
opportunities abroad. Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the
U.S. market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan=
ies
in this country, including Cinergy and Houston Industries (now Reliant),
which all fizzled.

LG&E is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the U.K. company's
desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market. LG&E should
be a good partner for Powergen, as the latter gains access to approximately
3.7 million customers. In addition, LG&E owns equity in and operates=20
non-utility
power plants in six states as well as in Spain; owns interest in three
natural-gas distribution companies in Argentina; and owns CRC-Evans Pipelin=
e
International, a provider of specialty equipment to the natural-gas and
oil pipeline construction industry. Altogether, LG&E's two utilities and
numerous unregulated businesses total about $5 billion in assets, which
should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind.
Perhaps Powergen's primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan=
y
values LG&E's comparatively low-cost power production and high standards
regarding reliability and customer service.

Yesterday (Dec. 11) marked LG&E Energy's last day of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. Shareholders on record should receive letters of=20
transmittal
from Powergen's paying agent, Computershare Trust Company of New York,
containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the
agreed-upon cash payment of $24.85 per share. An additional payment of
25.276 per share will also be paid to LG&E Energy shareholders on record
as of Dec. 8.

Powergen reportedly paid about $3.2 billion for LG&E, and assumed an=20
additional
$2.2 billion in LG&E debt. During the merger process, there was a lot of
speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LG&E, despit=
e
its disclosure of divesting key assets=01*such as overseas interests, its
metering business and two U.K. power stations=01*to generate liquid capital=
.
During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition,
Standard & Poor's kept Powergen's debt position under scrutiny, although
its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any
significant downgrades in its ratings. Moving forward, it will be interesti=
ng
to see how the company's rating changes now that the acquisition has been
completed.

We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of U.S. utilities=
=01*
and
all are still fairly new=01*so consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu=
re
of two foreign corporate cultures will work. As an example of difficulties
that Powergen might face, ScottishPower encountered a multitude of=20
difficulties
assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of
PacifiCorp. In addition, although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have
claimed that they intend to become major players in the U.S. markets throug=
h
their acquisitions of U.S. companies, that has yet to materialize.

Where the combined company goes from here is unknown. It is possible that
Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed
that this will be a key area of expansion. Another possible strategy is
developing its telecom business. Powergen announced its move into the U.K.
telecommunications sector earlier this year. Powergen's joint venture with
Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc=
ts
and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with
multi-utility billing solutions. Thus, speculation has been raised that
the company may develop this area of its business in the United States
as well. It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa=
ny
attempts an acquisition of a U.S. utility. Consequently, many eyes will
remain on the Powergen / LGE combination as it should be a good indicator
of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be.

1535,"TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source 
and sink filing.

TVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating 
that the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to 
the Entergy issue.  TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly 
talked with NERC to get a task force made up of members ""predisposed to 
Enron's point of view.""  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests 
to meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy.  
Finally, TVA understands that ""Enron has prevented SERC"" from bringing the 
matter to NERC ADR.

Entergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and 
sink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically 
states that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have 
known, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them 
on non-firm).  Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons 
why reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the 
reservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability 
until the 20/30 minute ahead tag.  Entergy says it can do a better job of 
listing actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system 
(although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, 
I question how many times Entergy has oversold Firm transmission.)  Entergy 
also states that it and the Security Coordinators can police the IDC tags, in 
case the marketer puts the wrong priority information on the tag (how often 
does this happen?).  [[I also don't know how Entergy is going to have time to 
check all this, when we called FERC hotline on them last year for lack of 
timely responses to reservation and tags]].  Although the IDC does not even 
analyze specific bus bars (and generator source and sink are optional on the 
tags now), Entergy says this is ""irrelevant"", but TLRs will be improved.

Entergy cites FERC's 1998 OASIS orders that ""EPSA has not made a compelling 
argument that disclosure would harm liquidity.""  I think that the compelling 
arguments are being made now about the discrimination.  Although FERC 
approved the source and sink, transmission providers have not been using them 
and the tags don't require them.

Entergy notes that when FERC issued the OASIS order, specific bus bar 
information was required on the tag -- now it is optional on the tag.  Even 
so, Entergy states that requiring it on the reservation does not make it 
inconsistent with the tag.  (I disagree.)

Finally, Entergy says that we can always put in ""anticipated"" source and 
sink, but if it changes, our priority may change.  It is my understanding 
that even the smallest change in source and sink will make some change in the 
power flows, so you effectively would always go to the lowest priority.

We are considering filing a response that states the lack of evidence on the 
reliability issues when NERC doesn't think this is required is a material 
issue of fact that should be set for hearing, at least.

Thanks for arranging a great afternoon yesterday - - I very much enjoyed our
conversation on people and idea generation as well as gaining a good
overview of Enron's key businesses. The tour was extremely educational and
we had a good discussion with Nate Ellis on Retail Services at the end of
the day.

I like your idea of getting the top executives together at some point soon -
- I know our Chairman, Chuck Knight, would be very fascinated with the
transformation at Enron and your business models for future growth. He also
loves to share and contrast different management processes and I think all
involved would take away some ideas to consider. David Farr, our new CEO,
would gain much from such an interaction and hopefully the establishment of
a long relationship between our firms and executive teams.

On top of this, I see a tremendous potential for our firms to work together
in a number of key areas where our product and service technologies would
complement the Enron offering of market making and risk management. I
appreciate your offer to help navigate some contacts to evaluate some of
these opportunities. Some initial impressions include:

* Evaluating the use of Energy Services on a broad scale at Emerson
operations

* Evaluating the solution package that we could jointly put together for
industrial customers with your Energy Services group and our remotely
controllable transfer switch, UPS and back-up power technologies that would
permit remote (Enron) control of whether a site is on/off the grid or even
selling power back to the grid.

* Evaluate the potential packages of Emerson systems, measuring devices,
control elements, power diagnostic, remote monitoring and visualization
products and technologies for use with Energy Services contract offerings -
- especially in specific vertical markets such as retail stores, grocery
stores, pipelines, paper plants,  semiconductor fabs, etc. We have over 2000
service and solutions people spread throughout USA and other world markets
which could support this effort.

* Enron Broadband Services is already a primary user of Emerson fiber optic
conduit, precision air conditioning, UPS, and other power and connectivity
products and services - - we can evaluate how we can extend our technology
platform to support the bandwidth market making activity and the content
offering of Enron.

* I also see some potential for Enron finance and risk management in
international infrastructure projects such as the Caspian Sea gas
development - - where it looks like there will be 30+ years of gas
production - - some of the local customers who are intrigued with embracing
our new PlantWeb Fields technologies for better yield/uptime/asset
management have had trouble getting conventional project finance resources
to support their projects. Given Enron understands what to do with gas in
kind, there could be a very interesting triangular arrangement with Enron,
Emerson, and local gas production companies.

These are some initial thoughts - - I expect there may be several other
interesting possibilities come to light as we start to have additional
conversations.

Steve, again, thanks for the arrangements yesterday and I will be back to
you shortly to organize a follow-up set of conversations.

1553,"California State Treasurer Phil Angelides held a press  conference this 
afternoon to announce that $3.5 billion in interim financing has  been 
arranged through J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers, and that an additional $1  
billion in financing is expected to be completed next week from an 
undisclosed  source.
?
The financing is in conjunction with an executive order issued  yesterday by 
the governor that allows bond?sales for energy purchased by  the Department 
of Water Resources.? Previously, Gov. Davis and Treasurer  Angelides had 
sought legislative approval of the bond issuance, but were not  successful.? 
Further review by state attorneys determined that the governor  could 
authorize the issuance of bonds by executive order with the difference  that 
the bonds can only be used for energy purchases going forward and cannot be  
used?to backfill past general fund expenditures.? 
?
A one-page?handout summarizing the financing has been  sent to Houston.??The 
vital statistics are:

The authorized loan amount is $5 billion, with an initial  $3.5 billion 
committed;
The rate is 4.75%, but will jump to 7% if the bonds are not  issued 
successfully by October 31, which is the scheduled maturity date of the  loan 
(Angelides emphasized that this is not the due  date).

The goal of the financing is to stem the flow of funds from  the general fund 
for power purchases and avert a cash crisis.? The  financing, which also 
provides working capital for continued?state energy  purchases,?is secured by 
revenues from electricity sales and will be repaid  by the bonds.
?
Angelides noted that the financing, which he hopes to have  totally closed by 
July 1, precludes generators from walking away from contracts  under the 
clause that requires financing by a certain date.? He said it  satifsies 
""most"" DWR contracts and?precludes arguments made by generators  for a 
""credit premium.""
?
Angelides also said that the financing is important because it  ""builds 
momentum"" for the huge revenue bond sale and that it ""sends a powerful  
signal to Wall Street that the bond issue is real.""
?
According to his figures, the general fund is currently out  about $5.2 
billion net ($6.1 billion in purchases minus $900 million in  revenues) in 
power purchases through June 12.
?
Steps still must occur before the bonds can be issued, he  said.? The PUC has 
to adopt rate agreements, adopt a servicing order with  the utilities to 
collect revenues to repay the bonds, and has to enact rate  increases of 
about 3 cents/kwh in SDG&E's territory.? Angelides noted  that the lenders 
have made their financial commitment event though these PUC  actions are 
still outstanding.
?
The bonds will not be issued until early September.?  Angelides said late 
August is a terrible time because the financial community is  on a pre-Labor 
Day holiday and that the state would hold off until the more  favorable 
period following the holiday.
?



?
Earlier in the afternoon, the Foundation for Taxpayer and  Consumer Rights -- 
Harvey Rosenfield's group -- held a press conference to voice  opposition to 
the Edison MOU.? They all seem to agree that the MOU is  likely dead, but are 
afraid of it arising at a later date in some form.  
?
When asked about the business community being asked to  shoulder the costs of 
utilities' debt, Rosenfield said that a problem has arisen  in that business 
wants direct access but DWR has already purchased the power  they ""don't 
want.""? He believes Edison alone should be responsible for its  debt; it's 
government's role to go forward, he said, and Edison's job to ""clean  up its 
mess.""
?
Rosenfield cautioned that if legislators ""make the mistake of  paying one 
more penny"" towards a bailout there will be a referendum on the  bailout and 
the legislators voting for it.? He said they would be  held personally 
accountable.
?
(Exactly what he means by this is unclear.? In  California, a ""referendum"" -- 
which is the word he used -- is a little-used tool  to overturn legislation 
that has been passed and signed.? Whether he was  threatening recall attempts 
is also unclear.)
?
Rosenfield added that depending on how things progress, there  could be an 
initiative and it could include a public power  component.
?
The press release issued at the press conference, which also  featured Harry 
Snyder of Consumers Union, has been forwarded to Houston.?  It is also

",,
1564,"I'm looking forward to your discussion regarding the ""reregulation threat"" at 
the next meeting.  Below are some of my observations:

While it's premature to say we have an energy crisis, we are witnessing the 
triple threat of high summer gasoline prices, spiking electricity prices, and 
high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season (I'll send along some 
of the data).
There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national 
political issue:  Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush's ties to ""big oil"" 
(which includes us by the way, though we produce nary a drop); and 
Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing 
to have a coherent energy policy (though, at least so far, the dominant 
characteristic of the administration's policy has been a republicanesque 
reliance on the market).  
Notwithstanding the issue's potential to become political fodder and its 
prominence in the popular press, many Americans seem blissfully ignorant, at 
least on the electricity issue.  We did some focus group testing recently in 
Southern California -- a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego 
price quakes -- and most people knew nothing about it.  So, while the issue 
has the potential for political traction, it may not have caught on yet 
(except in places like San Diego and New York city.
The reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in 
electricity markets.  Investigations of out of state ""price gougers and 
profiteers"" have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have 
been put in place.  They have not worked -- at least in wholesale markets.  
Suppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high 
elsewhere in the West, power flows out of California to those other markets.  
Ironically, though I can't explain it in classical economic terms, the 
setting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling 
prices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than 
enough supply.  For the most part, though, the caps and the other political 
reactions have been somewhat muted: policy makers have been reluctant to 
throw the deregulation plan out and start over, and the retail price caps 
have been relatively narrow ... so far.
Outside of California, the authors of other states' deregulation plans have 
distinguished their proposals from California's.  Regulators and legislators 
from such diverse places as Connecticut, Texas and Alberta have gone out of 
their way to defend their plans and explain why ""California won't happen 
here.""  For the most part, then, the reaction to California has been positive 
from Enron's perspective in states that have already deregulated.  There does 
remain some threat that aspects of the state plans (e.g. utility plant 
divestiture) may be postponed or cancelled.  The story is a bit more grim in 
states that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with 
their plans:  I think it's off the agenda in most places.  The fact that most 
of the major markets (about 70% of total electric revenue) are already 
deregulated/deregulating is a blessing in that regard.
At the federal level there has been a combination of the ""burn the village in 
order to save it"" approach  -- allow some price caps to remove the pressure 
to reverse the whole deregulation program -- and a more positive call for 
comprehensive reform.
All in all, I believe we're OK so far and we need to look at this as an 
opportunity:  business is booming;  we sell protection from price volatility 
and the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of 
major newspapers.  On the public policy front we need to convert the 
controversy into productive action.  Our target has been FERC -- they are 
somewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a 
single commissioner's vote away from taking action to further open the 
market.
Enron's response:  Initially we hoped to feed information into industry 
groups and let them carry the message; our concern was that Enron -- a 
company which was in and out of the residential market in Cal. -- would not 
make the most attractive champion for the open market message.  We hoped that 
the new generators in Cal would take up the mantle.  It's fair to say that 
they fumbled the ball:  they are now locked in a pitched battle with the 
utilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state 
profiteer label .... standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief.  They were 
also extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message.  We are 
now working the issue directly.  We are working the issue on a number of 
levels: 1) PR - we have good contacts in the press and have talked to 
numerous reporters and editorial writers.  As time goes on, the information 
and reporting has gotten somewhat better.  2)  Govt relations - we have been 
pushing for power plant siting legislation in California (the market wants to 
build capacity but the government won't let it).  This may be the best 
environment we'll ever see for streamlining the permitting process.  Also, in 
typical Enron fashion, we put a deal on the table.  We offered to sell power 
to the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable 
rates for their customers at below current rates.  Our offer was followed by 
nine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was 
offering better solutions than California politicians.  SDG&E dropped the 
ball, unfortunately.  Instead of seizing the opportunity, they ended up going 
along with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue 
a massive deferral account.  At the federal level we are contacting members, 
the DOE and FERC.  Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish 
""leveling the playing field"" in wholesale markets so power can get from where 
it is to where its needed.  Additionally, we are developing a prepackaged 
system (including software) for nondiscriminatory open access (to take away 
any lingering excuses or delays).  3) Overall messaging -- we have been 
working with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their 
resonance at the grassroots level.  As we hone these messages we will be 
using them in the fora we are currently working.
Overall, we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment, but 
capitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shot.
An intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this:  much of the problem in 
power markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices, particularly natural 
gas.  The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are 
advocating for electricity, so how can we maintain that the problem in power 
markets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on 
the planet (natural gas) is producing such outsized prices?  The answer is 
somewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current 
debate:  gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were 
pre-deregulation;  long term prices are also lower than historical levels ( 
the curve is ""backwardated"" (sp?) meaning that prices in later years are 
lower than today so you can buy gas for 3 years at a price lower than current 
spot prices); and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic 
inputs (this begs the question: why didn't the market react sooner and avoid 
the spike?).  When all else fails, a big part of the problem can be blamed on 
OPEC.  We haven't had this thrown at us yet, but we are trying to anticipate 
it and have answers at the ready.

 This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The issue is a great example of the 
intersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should 
promote a lively discussion when we get together.  Let me know if there is 
anything else you need.",Gore Bush Aunt Millie,,Enron FERC OPEC
1565,"Edison International CFO Disputes 'Technical Insolvency' Claim
By Mark Golden
  
10/03/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Edison International's treasurer and chief financial 
officer, Ted Craver, disputed Tuesday a claim made last week that 
California's utilities risk ""technical insolvency"" in 2001. 
Since May, California's three investor-owned utilities have been spending far 
more to purchase needed electricity than they are getting paid by customers. 
As a result, the undercollections in the ""transition revenue account"" of 
Edison's regulated utility unit, Southern California Edison, grew by $1.97 
billion between May 1 and August 31, the company reported to the Securities 
Exchange Commission. 
An article Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, which is published by Dow 
Jones & Co., said that ""if the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed 
the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers, as currently 
seems likely, they could become technically insolvent sometime next year."" 
""The way this term was used insinuated that you take the transition revenue 
account, and whatever the gross number is equates to the amount of debt that 
you would have to raise,"" Craver said in an interview. ""That is not at all 
the way it works. That is not an accurate portrayal."" 
California Gov. Gray Davis acknowledged the concerns Friday, saying, 
""California consumers have a legitimate need for California's utilities to 
remain solvent, and the state must be committed toward that end."" 
But Edison's Craver said the situation is not that simple. 
""That transition revenue account balance says nothing about what we have to 
fund in the market,"" Craver said. ""Southern California Edison has some 37 
balancing and memo accounts set up by the California Public Utilities 
Commission. What we have to fund is the net amount of all of them, plus 
whatever else is going on, and the net figure is considerably smaller than 
the $1.97 billion. It's like picking out one line item on the balance sheet 
and saying this is all that matters. No accountant does that or looks at it 
that way."" 
Craver also said that the term ""technical insolvency"" has no specific meaning 
to him. 
A PG&E Corp (PCG) spokesman declined to comment when asked this week if it 
risks technical insolvency next year. The company is seeking refunds from 
independent generators that have been selling power to the state's utilities, 
and for the future it has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
consider a return to cost-based pricing specific to each generating station 
in the state. 
Utility bond analysts, nevertheless, are concerned about California utility 
debt. 
""I don't believe the utilities are going to go bankrupt, but they don't have 
any assurance from the legislature, governor or regulators,"" Bear Stearns's 
Ted Olshanski said. ""The uncertainty is critical."" 
Bear Stearns has a negative outlook on Edison and PG&E bonds due to the 
uncertainty on the recovery of these energy costs. 
This summer's period of undercollections has continued into the fall, with 
the California's wholesale market for Wednesday power at $135 a 
megawatt-hour, compared with the $65/MWh that SCE gets from customers. 
The current best asking price for on-peak power fall all of 2001 in southern 
California is $85/MWh. 
When asked how long Edison can continue to fund the difference between its 
purchase power costs and the revenue it receives from customers, Craver 
responded: ""How long can ratepayers or anyone afford those prices, which 
don't have anything to do with reality? The market mechanisms don't work."" 
California's utilities are hoping to make significant changes to the market, 
and some of those changes would require action by the state legislature, 
which is out of session until December. 
""I don't know that this is something that waits for the legislature,"" Craver 
said. ""There are a lot of things that can be done before the legislature 
meets. We have significant issues before the FERC and the CPUC."" 
Olshanski said he hoped for a political solution. 
""We're not sure how its going to end,"" he said. ""We expect regulators and 
legislators to step up and provide for a constructive resolution. In the 
past, the California legislature has approved measures to make companies 
whole.""

The format, although somewhat informal, had a  court reporter present and 
transcripts will be published. Each state was invited to have 2 
representatives and one of the 2 had to be a Commission member.  Opening 
comments were taken from each state and then specific topics were discussed.

PG&E credit exposure.

Enron does not comment on specific credit exposures.  We are confident we 
have established adequate reserves related to energy issues in California and 
regardless of what happens there we are also confident we will meet our 2001 
(recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75.

(If pressed on the accuracy of the amount listed in PG&E's declaration)  
There are lots of numbers being tossed around for all parties that are owed 
money by PG&E.  All of them are subject to to modification as information is 
corrected or updated.  The numbers in PG&E's initial filing were estimates 
based on six month old PG&E data that may have been assembled very quickly.

(If pressed on the amount in the creditor committee letter)  Enron will not 
comment on specific credit exposures.  We will not confirm or deny any such 
numbers rumored to be in confidential correspondence.  Any number presented 
would need to be further examined relative to collateral, reserves and other 
credit offsets available under the circumstances.  Again, we are very 
confident that no event related to this issue will prevent us from meeting 
our 2001 (recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75.

If we are asked if we filed to be on the creditor committee, I would confirm 
that we did, and we are.

1589,"Thanks so much for your message.  Your communications are always complete, 
firm, clear and polite.  I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of 
your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end.  I understand 
from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you 
from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway.  I have asked John to 
lead the effort, to the extent you need him.  John and his team are very 
experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London 
office.  Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked 
him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the 
area in question.  It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of 
Enron's corporate security needs.  A little background I'll bore you with:  
after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not 
replace his function.  Most of the operating companies had their own security 
and business controls groups.  When Andre left, we reduced the corporate 
function to a ""default provider"" role -- if a business unit had a need it was 
not otherwise meeting, Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) 
would help identify competent resources in the area.  With the reorganization 
of EBS, I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had 
assembled (led by John Brindle).  John identified some concerns regarding 
India mid last week.  I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca; he did.  It 
was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already 
addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work 
involved implementation.  John volunteered to send some people over to help 
and I said OK.  He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike 
Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston).

The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying 
""we're from corporate and we're here to help"".  If you don't need any ""help"" 
or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better, let me 
know.

the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longer-term operations of th=

=20
the industry=01,s evolution:
1. Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk =01) Tension and differences=
=20
between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the=20
regulatory and political conundrum California=01,s investor-owned utilities=
 have=20
faced. If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets=
=20
remain regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators=20
pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should materialize? Tensions=20
between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will gro=
w=20
if states delay or abandon retail competition.=20
As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating, the prudence=
=20
principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be=20
changed. For example, if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated=
=20
wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be=

SUMMARY OF FERC=01,S
ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE=20
CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF=
=20
PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS
(Issued April 26, 2001)

Effective Date -- Price mitigation is effective May 29, 2001.  (ISO needs t=
o=20
have its day-ahead proxy price ready on 5/28)

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will=20
require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time =
to=20
the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade.  All California generators, ev=
en=20
those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into t=
he=20
ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's interstate=
=20
transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (This=20
requirement to provide power is for all hours (24/7) for 1yr)=20

Price Mitigation - The plan will establish a single market clearing price=
=20
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in t=
he=20
ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a=20
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power=
=20
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission=20
rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2/MWh for O&M.  The gas cost wil=
l=20
be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California;=20
emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage=20
Services.  The ISO will publish by 8:00 am, the gas and emission figures to=
=20
be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared. These=
=20
figures (for the next day) will be based on the prior day's Gas Daily and=
=20
Cantor Fitzgerald data. A single market clearing price is determined in rea=
l=20
time for all generators.  Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each=20
gas-fired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within 5 days, on a=20
confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating unit.  The=
=20
ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator,=
=20
including maintenance and operating costs.  Generators that submit bids at =
or=20
below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability. =
=20
(Although the following qualification is made: =01&However, all public util=
ity=20
rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on=
=20
market-based rates, discussed infra.=018  Presumably this has to do with=20
anomalous bidding behavior.)  In the event a generator submits a bid higher=
=20
than the proxy price, the generator must, within 7 days of the end of each=
=20
month, file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price.  FERC=20
explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the=
=20
=01&all delivery point=018 index it has adopted. FERC has 60 days to review=
/act. =20
No opportunity costs in real time.  Marketers are not held to any generator=
=20
cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based o=
n=20
specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost. =20

Underscheduling Penalites -- FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending=
=20
request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it=
=20
is still in place.  Thus, although it may be advantageous to wait to buy=20
power in R/T at capped prices, doing so may make the scheduling coordinator=
=20
subject to the currently effective $100/MWh penalty.  See p. 20 of the FERC=
=20
order.

New Generation --  New generation is NOT exempted from the Commission=01,s =
price=20
mitigation measures.


Demand Response -- Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving=20
entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load=
=20
to be curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to make the demand=20
curve more price responsive.  (This requirement is in effect for all hours=
=20
(24/7)) =20

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced=
=20
outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within 15 days of the=
=20
order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages,=20
including periodic reports to the Commission.

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June =
1=20
or Order lapses with no further effect.  The RTO filing is to be consistent=
=20
with the characteristics and functions in Order No. 2000.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how=
=20
things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are du=
e=20
in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based ra=
te=20
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on (1) no physical withhol=
d=20
of capacity, and (2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate=20
bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the=
=20
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit=
=20
behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be=
=20
inappropriate.  In addition, ""hockey stick"" bids are expressly prohibited=
=20
(i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).  Other=
=20
prohibited bidding practices identified include: pricing a single unit much=
=20
higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to=
=20
increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs.

West-Wide Section 206 Investigation  =01) Opens a section 206 investigation=
=20
concerning the J&R of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the=
=20
CAISO market.    FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price=20
mitigation.  However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in=
=20
real time (markets for power less than 24 hours in advance of R/T) spot=20
markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7% within a=20
control area.    FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in=20
California.  Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  Althou=
gh=20
it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the non-California PN=
W,=20
the FERC sets the refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the=
=20
Order.

NOx Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit =
is=20
prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines=
=20
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part=
=20
of the price bid.  Also if NOx is limited, may seek to show that generation=

Executive Summary:
? FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives. 
Politically, Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis; from 
an economic perspective, he is unwilling to create disincentives for new 
power generation
? Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan, most notably its exclusion of 
out-of-state generators
? June 1st ""kill clause"" for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional 
plan
? California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade, expected 
$20 billion power bill this summer--economic crisis would force deeper 
Administration involvement
? QF bid for advance payments from PG&E likely to fail in bankruptcy court
? New generation delays probable because of State/QF squabbling
? Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout 
deal

1. FERC Fallout
The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks 
like action, but is not.  Rather, it allows the situation in California to 
continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to 
allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape 
shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the 
Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the 
Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the 
forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps 
on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the 
construction of new generation.

It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were 
generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who 
favors price caps actually voted against this plan. 

2. Something Less than Effective Price Caps
 From Davis's point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws:
? The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west. 
Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to 
California.
? As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power 
than a ceiling.
? State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game 
the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2 
emergency and does not require any collusion.
? Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the 
highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require 
wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the 
cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.

3. Proposal ""Kill Clause"" Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis
The FERC proposal includes a ""kill clause"" that says the caps will be 
withdrawn unless California's ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the 
regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesn't sign on to the 
regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines 
blaming him for letting the ""Bush price caps plan"" collapse.

4. Growing Fiscal Risk in California
Sources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion 
on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of 
PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the 
situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take 
further action to control prices for  power.

The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about 
90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to 
finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.  
The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge 
loans they are providing to California.

The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness 
of the fiscal picture.  The country's largest and most prosperous state will 
have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating 
deficits in a matter of months.

5. QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&E
Meanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the 
bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGE's  accounts, 
since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for 
gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs' request will be granted. If the  
QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw  
of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline.
 
6 Delays Likely in New QF Generation
The QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being 
continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those 
contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.

7. Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan
Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an 
analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a  
utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number 
of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a 
""non-bypassable"" charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even 
if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is 
no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be 
used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would 
be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According 
to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private 
company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for 
the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not  
stand a likely constitutional challenge.  

8. Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power Contracts
The issue of the Governor's failure to  disclose the details of the long-term 
power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.  
Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been 
negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will 
challenged, creating an even further delay.

for the Japanese power industry and the accompanying appendices.

You will find changes in emphasis and structure, which make the paper more 
convincing, comprehensive and readable. We have tried to include a global 
view of market objectives in keeping with your approach in Houston, to give 
better explanations of why our recommendations are right for Japan at this 
stage and to address potential objections from deregulation's critics in 
Japan.

In addition to its earlier content, the new draft:

includes a new section setting up the objectives of a competitive market and 
defining a workably competitive market, before making specific 
recommendations to achieve those objectives in Japan;

addresses objections by utilities, etc. in Japan to our proposals. Current 
opinions or issues circulating in Japan include: California crisis, 
discrediting of a tight pool, success of PJM ensured by lack of requirement 
to unbundle, nuclear power development;

emphasizes the need for a strong, independent regulator given METI's recent 
inability to provide clear rules to support its recommendations and lack of 
expertise in the Fair Trade Commission;

de-emphasizes final section on public policy issues to emphasize market 
structure, by merging the public policy issues into one section, placing 
reliability at the top of the list and providing alternatives to achieve 
nuclear policy issues;

proposes implementation timetable in keeping with Japanese review process;

takes a punchier, more urgent approach in the executive summary and the paper 
as a whole.

The paper will be published as a Brattle Group paper commissioned by Enron 
Japan. Much input has been provided by Enron Japan but the economic arguments 
and general approach are in keeping with Brattle's written positions and 
standards. The written style of the paper is, of course, theirs.

We would appreciate any comments you might have on the contents of this 
paper. Since we will release the paper on 15 May and will create completed

1622,"I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today.  House 
hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate 
hearing was on last week's FERC order on a ""soft price cap"" and related 
issues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal 
Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation 
Implementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from the 
Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the 
three FERC commissioners.

HIghlights

Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton 
bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will 
happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will 
report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); 
Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.
There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that 
higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate 
increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation 
costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at 
the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical 
conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as 
it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country 
attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.
The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, 
attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism 
was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high 
price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell 
it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus 
sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their 
strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA 
testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region 
to support sec. 102.
Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a 
price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among 
the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could 
be done; the witnesses just said ""cost plus a reasonable profit"" and said 
leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had 
the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would 
take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last 
week's soft price cap is much better.
Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to 
admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT 
have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken 
recently. 
The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it 
was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when 
Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that ""help is on the way"" in the form 
of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that 
suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern 
came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat 
contentious at times.

Would buying boycott help lower California's electricity bill?
By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
AP Business Writer

05/03/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - There's a limit to how much people will pay for most 
things in life. If the cost scares off enough buyers, prices eventually fall. 
So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics 101 were applied 
to California's electricity crisis? What if the state officials struggling to 
maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price 
and accepted more blackouts this summer?
The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the 
notion seems surreal, given the possible consequences. 
Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate 
consumers, threatening to further depress California's already slumping 
economy - the sixth largest in the world. 
But desperate times require drastic measures, according to the economists, 
lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in 
the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely 
to produce recurring blackouts anyway. 
""It's better to use (blackouts) and break the (wholesale energy) cartel than 
simply to suffer them,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the 
Utility Consumer Action Network, a San Diego watchdog group. 
Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on ""would be like playing 
with fire,"" counters Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn. 
""Blackouts aren't a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold. 
They cost businesses a lot of money."" 
Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the state's power needs already 
has cost the California government $5.7 billion in the past 3 1/2 months. The 
state energy bill for 2001 could reach $50 billion, in money otherwise spent 
on education, public safety and health care, Shames said. 
Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit, some lawmakers think 
it's time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers - many 
of whom are based outside the state. 
This Tuesday, the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the 
state to refuse to buy power above certain prices. Current law requires state 
electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any 
cost. 
""We have been over a barrel in so many ways,"" said Sen. Dede Alpert, 
D-Coronado, who sponsored SB73x. ""Maybe there's a point in the market where 
(we) just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead."" 
Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding. 
""It's never going to happen. It's not a viable option,"" said University of 
California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein, one of the energy 
experts who have studied the idea. 
The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already 
skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers 
strike, economists say. 
Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies, leading to even 
higher prices at the pump, and distribution headaches that could leave store 
shelves bare. 
And some consumers - the elderly and the infirm, for example, need power at 
any price. 
Without electricity, Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldn't be 
able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home. 
""It would be a real hardship for us,"" said Jarzemkoski, 78. ""I'm on a fixed 
income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices. But we 
need power."" 
Despite such concerns, the concept of a buyer's boycott hasn't been flatly 
ruled out - at least publicly - by Gov. Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce 
the state's staggering electricity bill. 
The state is spending as much as $90 million per day to meet California's 
electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse. When the summer heat 
increases demand and tightens supplies, California might spend more than $1 
billion each week, state officials estimate. 
Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost, economists say. 
When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan. 
18-19, the economic losses totaled $2.3 billion, mostly from lost profits and 
wages, estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. 
Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state, and it becomes 
apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at 
inflated prices, even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit 
rating, economists argue. 
As it is, California probably won't be able to round up enough power at any 
price on some days this summer, making some blackouts a virtual certainty. 
The blackouts will reduce the state's economic output by $2 billion to $16 
billion, according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic 
Forum. 
The resolve of the state's politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested 
for a boycott to succeed, much in the way that labor strikes boil down to 
whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain. 
""Politicians aren't going to willingly turn out the lights because 
politicians want to get re-elected,"" said Borenstein, director of the 
University of California's energy institute. ""As soon as people start losing 
their jobs because the power is off, the public will get tired of the 
blackouts real quick."" 
Still, Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they 
understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course, said Stanford 
economics Professor Frank Wolak, who heads the Independent System Operator's 
market surveillance committee. 
""This isn't something you could do without an enormous public relations 
campaign,"" he said. ""The campaign would have to explain that the state had no 
other choice but to do this because (federal power regulators) aren't doing 
their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices."" 
The largest out-of-state generators are in such robust financial shape that 
it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California 
boycott that they would be forced to lower prices. 
After making record profits last year, power wholesalers Enron, Reliant, 
Dynegy, Duke Energy, Williams and Mirant and earned a combined $1.6 billion 
during the first three months of this year.

1654,"The following are?summaries of today's appearance by  Sen. John Burton to the 
Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this  afternoon announcing a 
lawsuit against FERC.
?
John Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at  a?lunch with the 
Sacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about  the Edison MOU, 
which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee  for review, 
the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the  Natural 
Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.?  (One 
columnist commented that Burton would ""love it to death,"" meaning it would  
get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance.)
?
The MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight  by the PUC.? 
He said that will not be the case when it leaves the  Senate.
?
Burton is obviously troubled by?the MOU; he said ""some  people"" say it 
doesn't just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.?  He said the 
following would have to take place for the MOU to be  acceptable:
?

Back debt must be verified;
All creditors must take a 30% ""haircut"";
The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an  amount close to 
what the governor has mentioned;
$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay  back debt.

?
When asked whether $400 million was enough, he said ""no"" and  that he feels 
the parent should pay ""a ton.""? That led to a discussion of  the dedicated 
rate component, which he doesn't like.?He used  the example that if 
electricity costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is  $5, if prices drop 
to $10 people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.? A  larger infusion of 
cash from Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the  dedicated rate 
component. 
?
Burton called?the dedicated rate component a ""big  problem"" and said it could 
be the strongest argument for use in an initiative  campaign.
?
He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that  the state should 
set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything  more (note:? 
this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support  from radio talk 
shows and other media).? He later threw out the number  $200.? The state is 
going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top  dollar, he said, so this 
is one way he sees to fight back.? It's tough  medicine, but as he put it, 
""You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy,  but two days later 
you're over it and your stomach's OK.""
?
Burton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how  he believe the 
situation should be handled:? ""The only way to deal with  exploiters is to 
terrorize the bastards.""
?
Asked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU,  Burton said the 
MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing  progress there 
are allowances that would let the process go as long as into  December.
?
?
LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE
?
Shortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to  announce a 
lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the 
Ninth Circuit.? A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier  this 
afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.? If  
additional copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.
?
The plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the  Senate; Bob 
Hertzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City  of 
Oakland.? At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry  Brown, 
atty. Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty.  Clark 
Kelso, a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz  
Figueroa; and Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland.? 
?
The suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling  within 21 days.
?
Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not  fulfilling its 
statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.?  Hertzberg added 
that FERC had ignored the law and that they  were compelled to file suit for 
Californians' relief.
?
Joe Cotchett said the suit is ""very basic"" and is based on the  Federal Power 
Act, which he says limits power costs to ""fair and justifiable""  rates.??A 
primary?strategy in this suit is to present it as a  ""health and welfare"" and 
public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million  disabled children and 
12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely  affected by blackouts.? 
He said it is ""not an economic lawsuit -- it's  about senior citizens, 
disabled kids and convalescent facilities.""? Today  also happened to be the 
legislative day for the California Association of Health  Facilities (the 
nursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were  apparently 
asked to sit at the back of the room for effect.
?
Cotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were  opportunities 
to exert market power.? He also claimed that a Redondo Beach  facility 
(obviously AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant  off-line 
and substituting higher rates.? He said, however, that this order  had been 
sealed.
?
He cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of  blackouts this 
summer, which could mean four hours a day.? That could be,  he said, 
""potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in  refrigeration.""? Cotchett 
noted that only hospitals with more than 100 beds  are exempt from blackouts, 
which does not protect surgical centers or many  health facilities.
?
Jerry Brown added that ""prices are unjust and people are  suffering.""? 
Continued high prices could mean ""potential civic disruption,""  and that 
there will be ""more actions to mobilize"" Western mayors.
?
Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of  the lawsuit.
?
Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV  here as a 
legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy,  in 
his Press Club appearance.? He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the  
media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the  
suit.?Burton's lawyer's sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it  
to?join the legal team.
?
Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market  power for 
three years, and that the commission has delayed  action?unreasonably.? It 
has failed to define ""fair and justifiable"";  that failure, he said, violates 
the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of  the Constitution.
?
Kelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon  ""fellow 
Republicans"" to support the effort.
?
Joan Breuner (sp?), Oakland's vice mayor, said only that she  believed that 
if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than  California, the 
president and FERC would have acted long ago.
?
During the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing  is necessary 
because ""5 generators supply 90%"" of the electricity in CA and all  five have 
rate renewals before FERC.? He also said one of the cases that is  relevant 
is Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set  
standards (regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal  
Protection clause.? He also said six states have expressed interest in the  
case and have requested briefs:? Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington,  
Minnesota and one other he didn't name.? None of these states has yet  
committed to joining the suit.","John Burton Burton Phil Jim Steffes Scott Govenar Bob

1656,"Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental ""anti-backsliding"" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer ""transition assistance""

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the ""transition assistance"" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a ""placeholder"" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a ""date certain"" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

1663,"Let's discuss when you're back in- not urgent.
",,,
1664,"Below are details of new plan currently being created by California State 
Treasurer Phil Angelides and supported by Sen. Burton.  The plan is in the 
initial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast-track.  It is 
also not motivated by a desire to save SoCal from bankruptcy.  The creator's 
goal is to give Californians more control over their energy and electric 
futures as well as giving the tax/rate payers a share of the pie in return 
for money that has/will go to the utilities.  We will continue to monitor 
this plan, its supporters and progress.

Plan Z
  California State Treasurer Phil Angelides and a powerful group of 
legislators are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve 
California's energy crisis this summer.  The group is comprised of leftish 
legislators, environmental advocates, in-state energy company executives and 
business leaders and they are pulling together a Plan Z.  At the core of the 
plan is the recently passed authorization to erect a California Public Power 
Authority that issues bonds, constructs new power plants and buys up 
transmission lines.  There is even talk within this group of using newly 
legislated authority to buy SoCal Edison for $3.5 billion (less than it owes) 
although they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from 
power companies as well as Edison itself.
  The five-year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarantee 
a 5%-15% ""cushion"" against energy peak demand.  Angelides and Burton want to 
create enough capacity to form a buyer's market.  One of the points of the 
plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector 
generation.  This plan may short-circuit private sector plans to build new 
plants, but the state has the ability to issue $5B in revenue-backed bonds 
(in addition to the $12B rate-backed bonds).    The second key element in the 
Angelides-Burton Plan Z is additional rate hikes for California's consumers 
and businesses.  Although discussions are still underway between this group 
and business leaders, Angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45% 
increase in residential and commercial electricity rates, however, there is 
immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on 
businesses.   This increase is on top of the 50%-60% already mandated by 
previous PUC decisions this year.  These rate increases will do two things: 
stop the immediate fiscal drain on the state of California and prevent 
emergency tax hikes (being serious considered last week).  
  Issues to consider in regards to this plan are: (1) how much will current 
shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long-owed 
debts (or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of SoCal 
Edison); and (2) how much will creditors have to ""eat"" in the legislated 
repayment plan?   In other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts 
be?  There is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to 
cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive 
and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year.",Phil Angelides Burton Angelides 50%-60,$3.5 billion 5B,SoCal SoCal Edison Edison Angelides-Burton Plan Z PUC

Thank you for taking your time last month.

I have additional questions. I am glad if you give me some suggestions.

First, are there any risk of soaring electricity price and brownouts in
regulated states like Florida or Northwest in the near future, for example
this summer?

Second, I found you mentioned about open access on existing transmission
lines. Who regulates access now in which area?

Third, in San Diego, why have other IPP built new plants and inter-regional
transmission lines even if they expected today's situation? Can I say that
Dynegy and Duke are the winners because they have bought plants from SDG&E?
Do Enron have interest to build new plants in California?

Again, thank you for your cooperations.

letter.  Although Enron would like the letter to be stronger, this letter 
went through many revisions to reach the consensus language necessary for a 
larger group to sign.  Thus, while not a perfect letter, it would send a 
stronger message with a multitude of signatures.

The status of the letter is that it is being ""held in our back pocket"" should 
it become necessary.  Pre-approval has been given and it stands in an 
""almost"" final form.  Should you have any grave problems with the letter, let

1693,"Attached are more articles that speak of the current California power crisis.

Mercury News Article primarily dealing with Governor Davis' view on the 
situation and what he is doing to help solve the issue. Davis has a three 
part plan: investigate price gouging, ask PUC to set up two-year plan to cut 
rates in half and asked for voluntary conservation. 

Asking Clinton to speed up a federal probe of apparent electricity 
price-gouging by out-of-state power producers and called on state regulators; 
A spokesman for the independent energy producers said his group welcomed a 
federal investigation, saying it would determine that ``California simply 
does not have enough generating and transmission capacity.'' 
To stabilize skyrocketing utility bills in San Diego; Davis called upon the 
Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday to set up a two-year plan to cut 
rates nearly in half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas 
& Electric.  Davis described his proposal as ``a rate-stabilization plan'' 
designed to lower bills. ;Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility 
Reform Network, a consumer group, criticized Davis' plan. She said consumer 
groups want the Legislature to freeze rates in San Diego at July 1999 levels. 
Volunary actions: Davis joined with grocers to announce a voluntary program 
to conserve power on extremely hot days, meaning lights in Bay Area 
supermarkets would be dimmed and air conditioning dials set higher to cut 
power use by 10 percent. 
Davis contends that deregulation will work out, perhaps in three or four 
years, when a dozen or more power plants in the pipeline start generating 
electricity. 



Mercury News article states it is not time to re-regulate the markets and 
provides the following solutions to solve the crisis.
Matters will improve when California has: 
-> More sources of power. 
-> A more sophisticated electricity market. 
-> Smarter consumers -- that is, consumers with the information they need to 
be thrifty. 
Also the article talks of the Power Exchange (PX) and the Independent System 
Operators (ISO) and how these two groups are making the prices higher; i.e 
market imperfections that result from the uniqueness of electricity as a 
commodity and the immaturity of the new exchanges are enabling producers to 
obtain higher prices than the underlying conditions dictate. 
Article concludes by saying the deregulated market is just beginning and with 
a few adjustments will work out fine


Mercury News article speaking of a new report commissioned by Governor Davis 
on the energy crisis. The article is primarily about the following issues.
A report commissioned by Gov. Gray Davis concluded that deregulation is ``not 
working,'' and recommended a series of actions, including asking the federal 
government to help control prices. 
The report was written by the president of the California Public Utilities 
Commission and the chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board and 
made 30 recommendations to help ease the threat of power shortages and price 
spikes. 
Report suggested that  the state-mandated freeze on utility rates, which is 
tentatively in place for PG&E customers through March 2002, might need to be 
extended further. 
The report also suggested the upgrading power transmission lines into San 
Francisco and  hooking up businesses to a central command center via the 
Internet, so their lobby lights and air conditioning could be turned off 
automatically when state power supplies were low. 
Two key state agencies, the Independent System Operator and the Power 
Exchange, were criticized in the report. It accused the ISO and the Power 
Exchangeof being unresponsive to the needs of consumers, in part because 
their boards include people with ties to power companies. It also complained 
that they did not provide key pricing and other data requested by the 
report's authors to assess the state's energy problems.
Also in the article is a repsonse by the ISO and PX to the claims made in the 
governor's report.

provisions in exchange for other items in the bill.  Reconsideration was
granted and the bill could be heard by the Senate again as early as
Monday.",Sher,,Senate Assembly
1705,"SBX 6 (Burton), which would establish a Public Power Authority, passed
out of the Assembly moments ago on a vote of 47 to 8.  The bill must now
go back to the Senate for concurrence.  I have attached the latest
version of the bill for your review.  Three amendments were taken on the
Assembly floor; (1) provide that PPA power utilized in California be
sold at cost based rates, (2) provide that the PPA can also construct
natural gas storage and transmission facilities, and (3) provide that
the state can site on public land, then auction the plans to developers.

faced. If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets=

w=20
if states delay or abandon retail competition.=20
As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating, the prudence=

1710,"FYI.  Rep Dan Burton's House ""Government Reform"" committee is touring 
California to get info on CA's energy crisis. Yesterday, they met in 
Sacramento.  Today, there in San Jose (Edison, PG&E and some Silicon Valley 
businesses are witnesses), and tomorrow they're in San Diego.  The hearing 
was widely covered on local TV news.  As the following story reflects, it was 
very partisan.


	Political shots traded at U.S. power inquiry 
	By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published April 11, 2001) 
	It was billed as a nonpartisan inquiry into the roots of California's energy 
crisis. 
	""We're not here to assign blame,"" Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said Tuesday at a 
hearing in Sacramento of a House subcommittee. ""We're not here to point 
fingers. We're here to listen and learn."" 
	But by the end, blame had been doled out in heaping portions and the fingers 
had come out of their holsters. 
	Rep. Doug Ose, the Sacramento Republican who is chairman of the panel, 
blasted Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, for keeping secret the details of the 
state's long-term electricity contracts. He raised the possibility of issuing 
subpoenas. 
	So did Burton, who sharply questioned Loretta Lynch, president of the 
California Public Utilities Commission, about whether the commission 
prevented investor-owned utilities from signing long-term contracts for cheap 
electricity. Lynch was appointed to the commission by Davis. 
	Lynch said the utilities were given permission and did sign contracts, but 
declined to give details, saying she was legally barred from doing so. 
	""We represent the Congress of the United States,"" Burton fired back. ""We want 
that information."" 
	The panel of the House Committee on Government Reform consists of 13 members, 
but only three attended, all of them Republicans -- Ose, Burton and Rep. 
Steve Horn of Long Beach. 
	All 13 were invited, as well as members of Congress whose districts are being 
visited by the subcommittee, which also plans to hold hearings this week in 
San Jose and San Diego. 
	""I'm frankly surprised they're not here,"" said Yier Shi, a spokesman for the 
subcommittee. ""This is a bipartisan issue."" 
	But if Democrats weren't on the podium, some were in the audience, including 
state party campaign adviser Bob Mulholland. He called the hearing ""a 
Republican sham to protect the Texas energy companies,"" and circulated quotes 
from former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, praising the legislation that 
created deregulation. 
	Much of the testimony focused on whether the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission should impose price caps on wholesale electricity prices. 
	Lynch said it was the only way to impose rationality on a ""dysfunctional 
market"" in which electricity generators and marketers are free to drive up 
prices far beyond what they would be in a competitive market. 
	Others, including FERC's general counsel, Kevin Madden, called caps a bad 
idea that would encourage sellers to go elsewhere, reducing California's 
power supply. Madden also said a cap imposed by FERC would only cover about 
half the power bought and sold in the West.

FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River

happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. 
""The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is 
something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,"" but the

Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action

""extraordinary regulatory treatment"" that the Commission gave it. Critics 
claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler

noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas.

she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even 
worse than it is. 
There should have been a ""fuller airing of this issue"" at FERC before the

Dennis Montali 
Bankruptcy Judge Faces Challenge of His Career 
Well-known expert in complex cases 
Harriet Chiang, Chronicle Legal Affairs Writer

N180032.DTL 
A veteran federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco now is calling the shots 
in California's long, drawn-out power crisis. 
Judge Dennis Montali has spent eight years helping financially ailing dot- 
coms, consumers and corporations get back on their financial feet. Now he is 
about to take on the biggest case of his career, and lawyers say that he is 
relishing the challenge. 
""He's one of the best judges in the country,"" said Lawrence Goldberg, a San 
Francisco bankruptcy lawyer with Goldberg, Stinnett, Meyers & Davis. ""He 
loves his job and he loves this kind of combat when lawyers come to court."" 
Montali, 60, has built a reputation as a hard-working, enthusiastic judge who 
often knows the facts of a case better than the lawyers. He is a scholar of 
bankruptcy law, having lectured and written law review articles. The more 
complicated the case, lawyers say, the more energized he becomes. 
On a personal level, he can strike the fine balance between the demands of 
the commercial world and the plight of the consumer trying to overcome a 
mountain of credit card debts, lawyers say. 
""He's an excellent draw for the case,"" said bankruptcy lawyer Shawn 
Christianson, with Buchalter, Nemer, Fields & Younger. She said that Montali 
has a combination of pragmatism, intellect and experience that will help him 
understand the problems of all those involved in this statewide crisis. 
Tall and lanky with a handle-bar mustache, Montali is a native of the Bay 
Area. Born in San Francisco, his father worked as a liquor distributor and 
later founded Montali Winery -- later Audubon Cellars -- in Berkeley. The 
young Montali earned his undergraduate degree from Notre Dame University and 
then entered the Navy to fulfill a Reserve Officers Training Corps 
commitment. 
After his discharge in 1965, he entered the University of California's Boalt 
School of Law in Berkeley and earned his law degree in 1968. 
He joined the law firm of 
Rothschild and Phelan in San Francisco and quickly developed a specialty in 
bankruptcy law. By the time he joined the legal giant Pillsbury, Madison & 
Sutro in 1980 he was an established expert. 
While he represented debtors early on in his career, he became a creditor's 
attorney at Pillsbury and quickly built a national reputation for his 
knowledge and his active role in the bankruptcy law community. 
In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco chose him for an opening 
on the federal bankruptcy court in Northern California. 
One of two bankruptcy judges in San Francisco, he has become an expert in 
doing emergency surgery on companies in critical condition, able to deal with 
crises quickly and with few complications. 
He has gained national prominence as a member of the National Conference of 
Bankruptcy Judges and the American College of Bankruptcy. He also was 
rewarded with an appointment to the bankruptcy appellate panel. 
When he's not bailing out a company, he spends his off hours cooking Italian 
food at his Berkeley home with his wife, Mary. He also loves to sail, walk 
his dog and spend time with his granddaughter. 
""He's going to put his heart into this one,"" said Larry Engel, a veteran 
bankruptcy lawyer with San Francisco's Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. ""He's got 
the respect of everyone in terms of his fairness and diligence."" 
""California,"" he added, ""is in really good hands in having the case with 
him.""

I will be traveling back from CA tomorrow so I can't make the call.  Some things to be aware of --

1.	EES/EEMC v. SCE Complaint

We filed Aug 30 before the CPUC asking the CPUC to re-instate our customer net bill amounts.  Jeff Dasovich will call John Fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case (or at least delay until after legislative session).  If complaint moves forward, SCE will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes.  Enron is preparing similar filing for PG&E, although we need to seek Relief from the Stay.  

2.	California Legislation

SCE MOU bill (that includes DA issues) moved Aug 29 through Assembly Energy Committee.  Needs to go to Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week.  By removing the conservation easements, the bill has lost some liberal Democrats.  Governor Davis is asking Business to find 15+ Republicans to move the bill.  Trying to modify (1) surcharge effective date to Sept 1+ and (2) get more comfort that SCE will pay our Negative CTC if $$ exists.

Also, the Windfall Profits bill has moved through Assembly Committee.  It has to go through Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Jennifer Thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached.

 

3.	AG Subpeona / Sen Dunn Subpeona

Litigation about both Subpeonas was heard this week in SF and Sacramento.  Mike Kirby believes that he may have swayed the Court in the Sen Dunn to provide a protective order.  A final decision may be issued next week.

4.	FERC Refund Case

Enron presented its ""ripple"" claim earlier this week.  Range of refunds (non-netted) is very large (please see Bob Frank for exact $$).  I have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by Alan Comnes.  Oral testimony is being prepared in PNW case for next week.

 

5.	NE RTO Mediation / SE RTO Mediation

Both proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the ALJ issues a recommendation next week (or soon thereafter).  Looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single NE RTO energy market is Nov 03 (PJM thinks it can happen by May 03 but wants some cushion).  Sarah Novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier.  Also, ICAP and control area consolidation is not considered at this time.  Christi Nicolay believes that the ALJ will recommend moving toward a PJM model.

6.	CPUC Decision to Suspend DA Retroactive

Sue Mara continues to push the CPUC to remove the retroactive date in the current Proposed Decision.  Some rumors that the CPUC will again delay a decision until Sept 13 (confirming so please keep close).

1718,"Power providers cry foul over fees 
State is accused of improper billing 
Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration. 
The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. 
Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. 
The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. 
""The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them,"" Smutney-Jones said. 
An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. 
The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. 
State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. 
Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to ""bury"" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. 
""The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO,"" Ackerman said. 
The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations ""absolutely false"" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. 
""The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento,"" Maviglio said. ""It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement."" 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. 
""I don't feel sorry for them one bit,"" Hidalgo said. ""They had one heck of a year."" 
Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. 
Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. 
The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. 
Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. 
The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board. 
In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become ""a political arm of the governor."" The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. 
Davis has warned Washington to ""keep its hands off"" the ISO.

?	SoCal Conference Call Highlights

SoCal Conference Call- The following comments are notes from the SoCal conference call for defaulted debt holders, held 1:30 p.m. PDT, 13 July 2001:

?	Ted Kravner, the SoCal spokesperson, indicated that there are ""a lot of bills floating around.  There's not a lot for us to say at this point.""  After such a long delay, he stated that, ""We are encouraged to see real action at the legislative level.""  Also, the company could not comment as to whether the plans made the utility creditworthy; ""We are evaluating that with Senate and Assembly leaders.""

?	The spokesperson stated that on Monday the company will make a regular interest payments on the 5 7/8 notes totaling less than $6 M.  The company will also make payments on its other notes; the total amount to be paid will be $27 to $28 M.

?	Yesterday the CPUC granted the company's motion on the QF fixed rate agreement with the gas cogen and renewable QFs.  The spokesperson stated that the PUC said SoCal can recover all costs associated with its payments to these QFs.


	Appalucia Management Questions to SoCal
	Q:  	Will SCE defer payment on the ""quids"" notes, which are backed by a trust that has bonds issued against it?
	A: 	Under the terms of the notes SoCal is allowed to defer payment for up to 20 quarters.

	Q:	Would the CPUC, after providing for the DWR to be reimbursed for purchasing power (through the California Procurement Adjustment, or CPA), leave enough revenue for SoCal to remain solvent?  This was based on reports in the press recently that the DWR had requested a 25% rate increase.  
	A:	These reports were ""speculation"" and were based on numbers that DWR had submitted several weeks ago.  SoCal stated that DWR must update these numbers; therefore, no formal CPUC decision on reimbursing SoCal vis-?-vis DWR can be made at this time.  SoCal indicated that these numbers would be updated ""in a few weeks.""

	Prudential Questions to SoCal
	Q: 	What bills are currently in process dealing with the MOU?
	A:	There is the Polanco bill, which is the original MOU; the 	Assembly (Hertzberg) bill AB 82XX, which uses the Polanco bill as its foundation; and a Senate bill crafted around Byron Sher's proposals.  SoCal stated that the Sher bill was ""less a matter of using Polanco"" and approaches the MOU ""from a different direction.""  SoCal indicated that ""people are currently studying the Hertzberg will to see what the components are.""

	Q:	What is your (SoCal's) reaction to the negative article in the LA Times today regarding the legislature's perception of the MOU?  
	A:	SoCal responded that ""the LA Times sees the glass as half-empty.  By my comments, I see the glass as half-full.  We are optimistic because there something tangible that people are working on.  The fact that Hertzberg's bill uses the governor's MOU as a foundation provides us with a level of optimism.""  However, he emphasized that the company was not in a position to say whether any of the bills would make the utility creditworthy.  

	Q:	Can the governor keep the legislature from recessing in order to force them to pass an MOU?
	A:	SoCal responded, ""yes, I understand that he does have that power.  We are running out of days.  The situation is becoming more critical.  We are on borrowed time from our creditors now.  Anything that moves us toward creditworthiness, we support.""  (NOTE:  In actuality, the Governor can order legislators to the floor for a vote, but they do not have to comply.  As Burton said in the press today, ""Only the legislature can force the legislature to stay."")

Deutsche Bank Questions to SoCal
	Q:	Is the transmission asset sale off the table or not?  
	A:	The sale is in the Assembly bill, but we ""think it's more of an option in the Senate bill, like it was in the San Diego deal.""

	Q:	What are your (SoCal's) thoughts on how the California Procurement Adjustment (CPA) mechanism could be constructed to keep SoCal solvent and if a change in the mechanism for reimbursing the DWR would be needed?
	A:  	""We are highly focused on this.""  The spokesperson stated that if 	revenue is distributed in a manner ""that puts the utility in a deteriorating balance sheet situation, this will be seen as a very serious situation.  This would be unacceptable.  Our cash position is currently stable.  These changes, this would be a very serious event.""

	Q:	Has SoCal reached an agreement on paying the non-renewables or gas-fired QFs 10% of what they are owed? 
	A:	SoCal indicated that it is still in negotiations with 4 of the larger gas-fired QFs (IEP Projects).  SoCal indicated that it would make its 10% payments once the PUC order to pay is final (a 30-day appeal period is still in effect, according to SoCal).",Ted Kravner Polanco Byron Sher's Sher Burton,less than $6 M. $27 to $28,SoCal Conference SoCal Senate Assembly CPUC QF PUC SCE DWR the California Procurement Adjustment Prudential the 	Assembly Hertzberg the LA Times Deutsche Bank
1721,"Gov. Davis open to tax on electric generators' profits 

Updated: April 4, 2001 - 5:52 p.m. 

Gov. Gray Davis says he is open to supporting a windfall-profits tax being
proposed by lawmakers on electric generators that have made a fortune
selling power to California this year. 

He also broke with his appointees on the Public Utilities Commission in
saying private companies and other large users should be allowed to contract
directly for power with generators. 

. . . . 

For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their
power from generators instead of going through the utilities. 

A January law that allowed the state to begin buying power for two nearly
bankrupt utilities barred such side contracts. 

""That was done originally with the thought the state would have more power
and no one to sell it to if companies got off the grid,"" Davis said. ""But
our problem is the opposite this summer. If companies want to get off the
grid, we should encourage, not discourage that."" 

The Democratic governor's comments came after he met behind closed doors for
more than two hours with Assembly Republicans, who have sharply criticized
his handling of the energy crisis. 

""I think everyone agreed there are no political winners unless we resolve
this challenge,"" Davis said. ""There were a lot of suggestions in there I'm
willing to adopt."" 

. . . . 

Davis said he hasn't written the remarks he will make during a five-minute
address at 6:05 p.m. Thursday that he has asked California television
stations to carry live. 

However, he said he will ""share with them (viewers) the progress that we've
made and what we have to get through."" 

He is expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases
approved last week by the PUC for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
and Southern California Edition Co.

DWR purchases likely to be about $25 billion and rates may have to go up by 
100%.  (See attached story.)
Apparently, one of the big reasons that 8X got held up yesterday is because 
Davis' own staff went to D leadership and said, ""don't move 8X (a bill that 
Davis was said to support) because the $10 billion cap on bonds won't work; 
they need much more."" 
It appears that rate increases will now become part of the mix, whether Davis

D103778.DTL 
COMMENTS on Gov. Gray Davis' energy programs by apologists for former Gov. 
Pete Wilson bring to mind Robert Kennedy's admonition that it is better to 
light a candle than curse the darkness. 
Let's examine the darkness created by Wilson's energy deregulation scheme. 
The 1996 law he signed could not have been more wrong headed. 
-- Why did it hand energy price control over to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission? 
-- Why did it free wholesale prices, while capping the price utilities could 
charge customers? 
-- Why did the former state Public Utilities Commission force utilities to 
sell off their fossil fuel power plants, leaving them vulnerable to predatory 
pricing by out-of-state merchant generators? 
-- Why did the Wilson-era PUC bar utilities from entering into contracts to 
ensure a long-term supply of cheap electricity? 
-- Most pointedly, why did California enter into deregulation without enough 
available generation to ensure a fair market based on balanced supply and 
demand? 
These are tough questions. It is not hard to understand why former proponents 
of the 1996 deregulation scheme would rather not answer them, preferring to 
bemoan the darkness and curse Davis' actions. 
The Wilson apologists jeer at plans for the state to purchase the power grid, 
though they surely know the value of a well-maintained, fully functioning 
electric transmission network. Bottlenecks in the grid impede the sharing of 
power between Northern and Southern California. This was a main reason 
Northern California experienced rolling blackouts in January while Southern 
California had plenty of power. 
The state's purchase of the grid will infuse new cash into the utilities, 
pulling them back from the brink of bankruptcy, while giving the state a 
tangible and valuable asset in exchange. 
And ownership of the grid will allow the state to modernize it, removing 
bottlenecks and upgrading technology - something the utilities have long 
failed at doing. 
The apologists ignore the state's strong record on energy conservation and 
Davis' actions to enhance these efforts. 
California now has the nation's second-best energy conservation record. The 
governor has budgeted $404 million in new conservation measures and added an 
executive order offering 20 percent rebates to those who reduce their 
consumption 20 percent over last year. These measures will reduce commercial 
lighting, encourage residential and industrial efficiency and make state and 
commercial buildings more energy efficient. 
The apologists disregard the fact that the governor has also reversed a trend 
that had seen power plant construction in California drop to insignificance 
in the '80s and '90s. Since April 1999, the California Energy Commission has 
licensed nine major new power plants. Six are under construction. This is 
part of a streamlined, fast-track plant licensing process that aims to put an 
additional 20,000 megawatts on line by the summer of 2004, a nearly 50 
percent increase in generation. 
And the apologists refuse to recognize that California is building the right 
sort of power plants - efficient, clean and environmentally friendly, with a 
strong bent toward renewable power sources. 
In fact, while some would go Texas' route and build plants that meet only the 
bare minimum of environmental requirements, California is continuing the 
effort that has made it the nation's leader in the use of clean, renewable 
power sources. 
Instead, the apologists engage in name calling, such as the charge leveled by 
former Wilson communications director Dan Schnur on this page that Loretta 
Lynch, the Davis appointee as PUC chair, is inexperienced and has failed to 
deal effectively with the energy emergency. 
Forget for a moment that of the 22 people who have served as PUC 
commissioners since 1980, only six had any energy expertise before their 
appointments. 
Forget for a moment that one of the principal architects of deregulation was 
Daniel Fessler, the UC Davis contract law professor with no special expertise 
in energy issues whom Gov. Wilson appointed as PUC president. 
Just consider this: It was the PUC under Lynch that freed the utilities to 
buy electricity on cheaper, forward contracts outside the Power Exchange. 
This corrected a huge Wilson-era PUC blunder that put utilities in an energy 
price straitjacket. The Lynch-led PUC also prohibited utilities from selling 
additional power plants, and it began the successful effort to make 
California's ISO (the Independent System Operator that runs the state's power 
grid) independent of the industry-connected officials who controlled it. 
Meanwhile, what sort of grand solutions have the apologists presented? Drill 
for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, build nuclear 
plants on closed military bases and encourage the construction of dirty 
Texas- style power plants in California. 
Drilling in the Arctic will not produce a watt of new power for California. 
Californians have long said they do not want the risks presented by new 
nuclear plants. 
And lax Texas pollution rules prompted the Dallas Morning News to charge in a 
Dec. 17 editorial that Texans are choking on the exhaust from power plants. 
Most disingenuously, the apologists would ""let the market work,"" claiming 
that unfettered market forces will soon bring fair and balanced prices. But 
the market doesn't work now, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has 
repeatedly admitted, most recently with its finding that generators 
overcharged the state in January. 
Unfortunately, for the most part the same commission had refused to clamp 
down on sky-high prices charged by generating companies. Look at New York's 
deregulated market, where there are no caps on retail electric prices. Market 
forces have done consumers there little good. New Yorkers pay the highest 
prices for electricity in the country. And the New York Times has reported 
that rates paid by consumers have increased a whopping 40 percent just since 
1999. 
Those who would allow the market to work (let the darkness reign) know well 
that if the market ""works"" to produce New York-style rate increases in 
California, the consequences to the public would be dire. 
Compare this to Gov. Davis' well-structured plan for effective energy 
conservation and stabilization of the state's electricity market and his 
expedited program to bring clean, efficient new power plants on line quickly. 
Robert Kennedy would understand Gov. Davis' approach and his critics' 
perspective.

Bombshell Warning on Power Cost 
Spending may double and rates skyrocket, governor's office tells Legislature

N176940.DTL 
Top Davis administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the state 
may have to spend twice as much as expected on electricity purchases over the 
next two years - requiring rate increases of as much as 100 percent. 
The stunning admission by the Davis administration contradicts his repeated 
promises that his plan to ease California's energy woes could be done without 
a rate increase. 
California will probably need to issue $23 billion in bonds for electricity 
buys, more than double the amount Davis said would be needed by the state to 
keep electricity flowing until California's cash-poor utilities can get back 
on their feet. 
Administration officials told lawmakers to stop action on a bill that would 
have capped the state's energy purchases at $10 billion. 
But a Davis spokesman said the numbers were far from firm. 
""There are a lot of scenarios being run . . . and until we complete the 
negotiations, this can be added up any way you want,"" said Steve Maviglio, 
press secretary to Davis. 
""Those numbers are not based on any reality right now,"" he said. ""There are 
too many things up in the air."" 
Assembly Democrats told a different story. 
They said Tim Gage, director of Davis' Department of Finance, Cabinet 
Secretary Susan Kennedy and John Stevens, Davis' top energy aide, met with 
Assembly Democratic leaders and dropped the bombshell. 
And they did so just as those same leaders were trying to convince fellow 
lawmakers how important the bill was to the Davis administration. 
They also said that Davis, who was in the Palm Springs area for most of the 
day and briefly attended a fund-raiser at a golf club, was unaware of the 
figures. 
PURCHASES IN BILLIONS
The three top aides said that electricity purchases for this year by the 
state would be $16 billion, not the $10 billion initially predicted. An 
additional $7 billion in state power purchases would be needed next year, 
they said. 
The state has been buying power at a clip of $45 million a day since Jan. 17 
because the troubled utilities could no longer afford to make the purchases. 
From the start of the energy crisis, the state has planned to repay its power 
purchases through bond sales. The bonds would be paid off by a portion of the 
amount ratepayers are charged on their monthly bills. 
Davis has so far insisted that enough money could be found to cover the $10 
billion without raising rates. 
But his aides said if the size of the bonds ballooned to $23 billion, a hefty 
rate increase would be necessary. 
INCREASE UPON INCREASE
The Public Utilities Commission is already planning to make permanent a 
temporary 9 percent increase. An additional automatic 10 percent is scheduled 
for no later than March 2002. 
But the aides said, on top of that, an additional 60 percent to 80 percent 
increase would be required to cover the debt service. 
""For some time, I have believed a fundamental part of solving this problem is 
admitting there needs to be a rate increase, and the numbers that have been 
shared today make that inevitable, and we should start dealing with the 
reality as soon as possible,"" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek 
(Santa Cruz County). 
One consumer advocate said the revelation means the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy because the state and ratepayers won't have the cash to bail them 
out. 
And it could mean political trouble for Davis. 
""Unless the governor issues an ultimatum to lower the prices, everybody's 
bill will double, and he will not be able to run for re-election in 2002,"" 
said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. 
PG&E THREATENS SUIT
The news came as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. threatened to take the state to 
court over Davis' plan to force the company to pay back certain creditors. 
Davis' proposal would require the utilities to pay alternative power 
generators for all the power that they supply, something PG&E said it cannot 
afford to do. Several of the generators shut down earlier this week as 
rolling blackouts spread across the state. 
The bill stalled yesterday in the Assembly as Republicans objected. Lawmakers 
will resume debate Monday. 
Earlier in the week, Davis announced that action would be taken by the 
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission that would guarantee payment 
to the alternative energy providers. He also said the state -- which has 
spent $3.7 billion to purchase power -- should be paid back first. 
Without that promise, several of the small biomass, solar and wind producing 
plants -- called qualified facilities -- said they would have taken Southern 
California Edison Co. into bankruptcy court. The alternative generators 
provide enough electricity to power roughly 6 million homes. 
PG&E said it cannot afford to pay the alternative producers and reimburse the 
state for the billions it has spent purchasing power. 
""These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion 
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further 
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation,"" Gordon Smith, PG&E's 
president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
DIFFERING VIEWS ON COSTS
According to PG&E's numbers, the company collects $400 million a month in 
rates. It says the average price to pay all the generation sources exceeds 
$1. 4 billion a month. 
But consumer advocate Nettie Hoge said the utilities are exaggerating their 
own costs in order to try to keep as much money as possible. 
""It's just absurd,"" said Hoge, the head of The Utility Reform Network. ""They 
have a temper tantrum every time something doesn't go their way."" 
The bill PG&E objected to is necessary to allow the PUC to order utilities to 
pay small power generators who agree to sign lower-priced contracts to 
provide energy. 
The proposal offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The 
going rate now is about $150 a megawatt. The PUC wants to act as early as 
Tuesday to bring some financial relief to the generators, who have been paid 
pennies on the dollar. 
Assembly Republicans objected to the bill in part because it would allow the 
PUC to change the formula for setting the price paid alternative producers so 
that it no longer considered the price of natural gas. 
Co-generators -- some of the largest of which are operated by oil refineries 
-- say without the price of natural gas as a consideration, it would cost 
them more to produce energy than what they would be paid for it.

Electricity Elsewhere

Business Wire

(Copyright , 2001, Business Wire)

EL CENTRO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 22, 2001--A California court ruled 
today that a geothermal energy supplier in the Imperial Valley can 
temporarily sell its electricity on the open market despite its long-term 
contracts with Southern California Edison, because Edison has breached the 
contract by failing to pay for any output since Nov. 1.

Cal Energy Operating Corp. operates a complex of geothermal plants near the 
Salton Sea. The plants filed suit Feb. 20 in Imperial County Superior Court 
seeking back payment from Edison and authorization to suspend their contracts 
with Edison and sell power elsewhere in California during such time Edison is 
unable to pay for power demand.

David L. Sokol, chairman of Cal Energy, said, ""We applaud this short-term 
solution that will provide us with a revenue lifeline and keep our clean, 
renewable power flowing to Californians. It is unfortunate that it took court 
action to provide us some relief from an intolerable situation.""

Sokol noted that the ruling did nothing to assure that the plants collect 
approximately $140 million Edison owes them for power they have produced 
since Nov 1. The geothermal plants will continue to pursue legal and 
legislative remedies to receive back payment, he said. ""That debt will 
continue to place a great strain on our operation.""

He added that Edison has continued to collect tens of millions daily from 
ratepayers and has amassed approximately $2 billion in cash.

On the open market, the geothermal plants will be able to receive on the spot 
market higher prices than renewable generators agreed to accept in 
negotiations with the state, Edison and PG&E. That lower price had been 
incorporated in Senate Bill 47X, which stalled in the state legislature after 
Edison withdrew its support, and has effectively been incorporated in the 
California Public Utility Commission's proposed order. California taxpayers 
will pay the difference, because the state is buying electricity on the open 
market on behalf of Edison and PG&E.

""It is unfortunate that taxpayers will now be paying more for our 
electricity,"" Sokol said. ""That is the result of inaction by the state and 
bad faith by Edison. We negotiated with the full blessing and knowledge of 
the governor and the legislature to arrive at long-term pricing that would 
assure reliable supply and save taxpayers billions. This pricing for our 
clean, renewable energy was less than the state is paying out-of-state 
fossil-fuel energy providers in long-term contracts, and less than half what 
we are allowed under federal law.""

Sokol added that he was encouraged by the governor's March 20 announcement 
proposing legislation and action by the California Public Utility Commission 
that would require Edison and PG&E to begin paying current bills for 
electricity received from qualifying facilities such as CalEnergy.

But, Sokol cautioned, ""While we are hopeful that this legislative and 
regulatory action can move forward quickly, there are many details to be 
worked out in the governor's proposal. Even with quick action, there is a 
serious question whether Edison is willing to pay any of its current bills 
from qualifying facilities.""

He noted that, like today's court ruling, the governor's proposal provides no 
plan or schedule to require Edison to pay the approximately $140 million 
Edison owes for power CalEnergy has delivered to date.

CalEnergy's geothermal complex employs about 200 workers and produces a total 
of 268 megawatts -- enough to supply 268,000 homes.

Geothermal plants and other generation from renewable sources provide about 
12 percent of California's electricity, enough for 5 million homes. 
Geothermal plants produce environmentally friendly electricity from wells 
that tap superheated water 5,000 to 10,000 feet underground. Magma rising in 
fissures in the earth's crust heats the water to 500-700 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The generating plants convert the water to ""live"" steam, the pressure of 
which turns turbines to produce electricity. The plants then return the 
slightly cooled water to the subterranean reservoir for reheating as a 
renewable resource.

CalEnergy is one of 10 members of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, a 
group of green power suppliers who formed the committee on Feb. 15 to explore 
options to collect back payments from Edison. Together, the group is owed 
more than $300 million by Edison.

teleconference at 2:30 p.m. PST today, March 22. Call 800/810-0924 and enter

""Frequently Asked Questions About Implementing Real-Time Electricity 
Pricing in California for Summer 2001""
This paper attempts to address the questions that have arisen in policy 
discussions and press reports about proposals to implement real-time 
electricity pricing for large commercial and industrial customers for the 
coming summer. The paper explains the distinction between real-time and 
time-of-use pricing, contrasts real-time pricing with paying customers for 
demand reduction, and clarifies who would be the winners and losers under 
a real-time pricing program. It also explains why real-time pricing is 
likely to be the most effective approach to reducing the risk of rolling 
blackouts this summer and lowering the total payments that the state will 
have to make to purchase electricity for consumers.

			Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis' optimistic assessment that California may be 
on the ""back side"" of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy 
companies and other experts predict. 
			California's real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply 
increases, and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes, predictions are 
that large chunks of the state will be in the dark.

than the governor is suggesting,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive director for 
the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park. 
			""To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the 
popular notion we don't have an energy crisis. We do. We have a very serious 
one that's going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up,"" Ackerman said. 
			The Democratic governor's comments were made Monday in Washington, D.C., 
during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street 
support for his energy plan. 
			He admitted more hard work is needed, but said the state is on the ""back side 
of the crisis"" because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower 
electricity prices. 
			""Does that mean we're home free?"" Davis asked yesterday. ""No."" 
			But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis. 
			That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator, which 
oversees the state's power market. 
			On any given day in June, the ISO estimates, the state will fall 6,815 
megawatts short of demand. That would put nearly 7 million homes in the dark, 
if it happens. 
			In July, the expected shortage is 4,685 megawatts. In August, it's 5,297 
megawatts. That's if California has a normal summer. If it's hotter than 
normal, the shortage grows. 
			The ISO's estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis' 
conservation goal. 
			But even if a 10 percent reduction were achieved in June that would save 
roughly 5,000 megawatts, the state would still be short 1,800 megawatts. 
			And there are other variables. 
			Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels, hydroelectric plants may not 
be able to run at full bore, which would also worsen the situation. 
			""That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of,"" said Sen. Tom 
McClintock, R-Northridge. 
			Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will 
help the state get through this summer. 
			The clock is running. The ISO predicts shortages of 3,030 megawatts in May - 
- just two months away. 
			""The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer, and I don't think 
we've made enough progress there,"" said Severin Borenstein, director of the 
University of California Energy Institute. 
			California won't be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly 
approving and building new power plants, Borenstein said. 
			The ISO's demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come 
online this summer. 
			""Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and 
now,"" Borenstein said, ""we are going to face some serious shortages."" 
			Like Davis, Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy. 
Unlike Davis, he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an 
incentive to cut back. 
			But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message. 
			By telling them the worst is over, he could undercut his plan by making 
people believe more conservation is unnecessary. 
			Excluding what lies ahead, there are also plenty of energy issues left 
unresolved right now. 
			Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison 
on purchasing its share of the state's transmission system for $2.7 billion 
-- no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas & Electric or San Diego Gas & 
Electric. 
			Some alternative energy producers, like co-generation plants, are shutting 
down because the cash-poor utilities haven't paid them for several months. No 
cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice. 
			Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy aren't convinced the crisis 
has passed. 
			For starters, both companies are owed in excess of $700 million for 
electricity bought by PG&E and Edison but never paid for. 
			""There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state 
will require this summer, whether there is enough generation on the ground or 
available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in 
demand,"" said Richard Wheatley, a Reliant spokesman. 
			Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 
has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over. 
			""We've said all along it's a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities 
and the energy companies,"" Rosenfield said. 
			""Now that taxpayers are paying $1 billion every three weeks to buy 
electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between $13 billion and $20 
billion, the companies are happy and the crisis is over. What more could they 
want?""

Honorable James Hoecker

Chairman

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

888 First Street, N.E.=20

Washington, D.C. 20426=20

Dear Chairman Hoecker:

I told you on November 14 in San Diego that, by December 1, I would respond=
=20
to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and=
=20
businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the=
=20
lowest reasonable cost. Obviously, a complete plan by the State of Californ=
ia=20
must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order, and=
=20
final action on that order on December 13. This letter outlines the first=
=20
steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive=
,=20
ongoing discussions with legislative leaders, consumers, business, utilitie=
s,=20
generators, environmentalists, labor, agricultural interests and other=20
California stakeholders.=20

This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the=
=20
concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to=
=20
assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer.

The free market applied to electricity can work, but only if market=20
conditions allow for real competition, and if all parties act responsibly.=
=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has found that the wholesal=
e=20
market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged=
=20
by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable.=20

For that reason, I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that=
=20
are critical -- and clearly within your jurisdiction -- to order retroactiv=
e=20
refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year, and to establish=
=20
hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy=20
marketplace becomes truly competitive. I do not believe that your proposed=
=20
$150/MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection. I again ask=
=20
you to impose real price and bid caps in the $100/MW range on a transitiona=
l=20
basis over the next 36 months.

If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale=20
markets, the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited=
=20
in scope. I cannot in good conscience, however, forego any measure that wou=
ld=20
serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the=20
sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again.

Since our meeting in San Diego, several things have occurred which influenc=
e=20
my current thinking.

On November 20, 2000 the California Energy Commission (CEC) published the=
=20
results of a detailed bottom-up study of available electricity supply for=
=20
2001. It shows that -- taking into account expected load growth, firm and=
=20
dynamically scheduled imports, and new supply already under construction or=
=20
under contract -- California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie=
s=20
are properly managed and scheduled. This presumes, of course, no gaming or=
=20
withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying.=
=20
But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that mark=
et=20
power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of high deman=
d.=20
The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of=20
market power and withholding that existed in summer 2000 will exist in 2001=
.=20
You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior.

During the week of November 13-19, while you and regulatory commissioners=
=20
from around the country were in San Diego, California was subjected to=20
several Stage 2 Alerts, reflecting severe shortages of generation, even=20
though these are the lowest load months of the year. Prices were=20
astronomical. More than 12,000 megawatts of generation were off-line at the=
=20
same time, including over 5,000 megawatts for ""unscheduled outages."" I will=
=20
recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are availab=
le=20
to meet California=01,s local energy needs, and that information and the=20
authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are available to=
=20
state and local officials.

On November 22 the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and=20
Electricity Oversight Board (EOB) filed comments with you that summarize th=
e=20
current status of their ongoing investigations. They confirm the conclusion=
s=20
of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by t=
he=20
exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer=
=20
and fall 2000. The state agencies have been hampered in their investigation=
s=20
by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both=
=20
assist in the understanding of last summer=01,s prices and in the fashionin=
g of=20
remedies to assure that we are not victimized again. I urge you to compel t=
he=20
necessary disclosure of information to complete these investigations.

On November 21 the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) on the=
=20
proposal by PG&E to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated=
=20
utility. The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant=20
unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferr=
ed=20
alternative. This suggests that California=01,s course of generation divest=
iture=20
by utilities may be slowed or stopped.=20

With these events as background, I want to describe the steps I have taken=
=20
and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California.

Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure

During the 10 years preceding my administration, virtually no power plants=
=20
were built in California.=20

Since April 1999, six power plants representing 4,700 MW of new generation=
=20
have been approved by the CEC. Five of these plants are under construction=
=20
and the sixth will begin construction no later than April 2001. Twenty more=
=20
applicants have completed pre-filing and have active applications under=20
review by the commission staff. Eleven more applications are in the=20
pre-filing stage.=20

This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds=
=20
to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without=20
abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and=20
environmental protection.

Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation=
=20
in California. With enactment of AB 970 and the creation of the Governor=01=
,s=20
Clean Energy Green Team this September, California has aggressively committ=
ed=20
itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation an=
d=20
to coordinate local, state and federal government agency review and action.=
=20

Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the=
=20
construction and operation of new power plants. Through the Green Team, we=
=20
are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges, workin=
g=20
with local air quality districts, the California Air Resources Board and th=
e=20
United States Environmental Protection Agency. These might, for example,=20
expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant, where mobile=20
emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that=
=20
will be generated by the new facility. If necessary, I will seek legislatio=
n=20
to enable these new approaches.

I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to=20
otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and co-generatio=
n=20
where it is viable, cost effective and environmentally sound. The CPUC has=
=20
already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting=20
certificates for transmission facilities, including environmental review.=
=20

Finally, I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electrici=
ty=20
are available when emergency conditions exist, to avoid interruptions such =
as=20
those experienced last summer and as recently as last week. Suggestions we=
=20
are considering for achieving this include new means of coordinating=20
power-plant maintenance and operations activities.

Forward Contracting by Utilities

Many parties, including the FERC, have recommended expanding the use of=20
forward contracting by the utilities including multi-year bi-lateral=20
contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices. The=
=20
contracts, as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio, represent an=20
important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability. I am=20
asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the=20
reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly ""second guessing"" these=
=20
decisions in later years.

This process should be in place early in 2001 to provide adequate opportuni=
ty=20
for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer 2001.=20

Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio=
n=20
of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi=
a=20
Power Exchange (PX). This issue requires careful consideration since these=
=20
transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure, and=
=20
safeguards are in place to assure delivery. These protections for consumers=
=20
and business must not be lost.

Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a=
=20
cost-effective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain=20
their existing generation, as was recommended in the CPUC's environmental=
=20
impact report regarding PG&E's hydroelectric facilities. There is growing=
=20
consensus around this matter.

I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory=20
decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers.=20

Invigorating the Demand Side

Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of California=01,s energy=
=20
future.=20

Under my Executive Order, the State of California has achieved more than 18=
0=20
MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage 2 alerts, and is moving=
=20
quickly to add another 250 MW of demand reduction for summer 2001. The=20
federal government is following suit for federal facilities. The state and=
=20
federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load=20
reduction initiatives in the private sector.

I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t=
o=20
develop a voluntary 10 percent demand reduction program during peak hours f=
or=20
more than 2,000 groceries statewide. This program must be duplicated in oth=
er=20
areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged t=
o=20
work cooperatively toward that end.

I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the state=01,s de=
mand=20
reduction programs for commercial and industrial users, including the=20
interruptible programs. Those that are successful should be expanded. Those=
=20
that require change should be modified. And new opportunities should be=20
developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply. The=
se=20
programs must be in place no later than March 2001, to provide adequate=20
opportunity for private sector planning and participation.

I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate=
=20
and implement programs which provide real-time price signals and=20
energy-reduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users, and=
=20
to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small=
=20
businesses.

In September, I signed historic urgency legislation that provides $50 milli=
on=20
for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer 2001. I als=
o=20
signed legislation that provides approximately $500 million annually for th=
e=20
next 10 years for energy efficiency, research and development and renewable=
=20
resource support. The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative=20
demand reduction programs using these funds.=20

Institutional Reform

As I testified at the FERC hearing on November 14, I agree that the=20
stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) an=
d=20
California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their=
=20
members and must be replaced. The composition of these boards is specified =
by=20
state law, both as to size and as to qualifications for directors.

I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independe=
nt=20
boards that are accountable for their actions, and that will consider both=
=20
the need to assure reliability and the most economic method to do so.=20

I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem. Your concurrence in=
=20
this effort is extremely important. It will little serve the consumers,=20
utilities, merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in=20
litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in 1935,=
=20
or what traditional state powers, if any, Congress meant to circumscribe or=
=20
override.=20

Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of=
=20
these entities, as some have suggested, I do not intend to let the status q=
uo=20
continue while those debates are carried on. California will alter the=20
composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in positi=
on=20
to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and feder=
al=20
law -- protection of the consumers' interests.

In 1996 Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in=
=20
the FERC in moving California=01,s electricity system into an unbundled,=20
federalized mode. Now is the time for you to justify that trust. I want to=
=20
cooperate with you in transitioning to a market-based approach to provide=
=20
this essential service. However, first and foremost, I want you to do your=
=20
job and to let me do mine. Together we can protect the electricity consumer=
s=20
of California and work to restore their confidence.

Thanks for this analysis. I think we would all agree that the solution to
put power
100% in the hand of the state is an extremely frightening proposition.
Unfortunately, it
falls in-line with what Gov. Davis likes to do, which is to control all of
the process himself.
I know John will not be able to digest all of this, but will brief him over

excellent arguments you make here against support for AB1X.

I will give you all feedback from the meetings tomorrow. Thanks for all

",Jeff Davis John Laura,,
1761,"Attached, please find a press release from Governor Davis regarding
distributed generation, renewable energy and co-generation.  Please
note, the Governor is advocating the elimination of stand-by charges.

",Davis,,
1762,"Hi Laura:  I've attached three things, but first wanted to give you a bit of 
an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities 
Commission.  

Move to Prohibit Customer Choice
As you may know, AB1X, the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the 
Governor signed, gives the California Department of Water Resources the 
authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities.  Included in that bill, 
however, is a provision that prohibits ""Direct Access,""  California's term 
for customer choice.  

In sum, the bill, in its current form, prohibits businesses and consumers 
from chosing an alternative energy service provider, like Enron.  Our 
understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition.  
Their reasoning is that they need a ""captive"" customer base to pay for the 
bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWR's power purchases.

Customer choice was of course the foundation of California's restructuring 
law, AB 1890, and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally 
flawed plan.  For example, the only businesses and consumers that were 
protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those 
businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with 
competitive service providers.  Ironically, the recently passed legislation 
takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage 
their energy costs.  Before AB 1890, consumers and businesses had one 
choice--the monopoly  utility.  With the passage of AB 1X, they again will 
have one choice. But this time their only choice will be to buy from a 
government agency DWR.

A broad coalition of consumer groups has expressed its opposition to the 
prohibition and Senator Debra Bowen (a key player on the Senate side), and 
Fred Keeley (a key player on the Assembly side), have promised to ""fix"" the 
prohibition in another bill ""SB27X.""  I'll forward in another email the 
language that the coalition has drafted and hopes Bowen and Keeley will carry.

Unfortunately, we are now hearing rumors that the Governor intends to direct 
the California Public Utilities to immediately implement the provisions of 
AB1X prohibiting Direct Access, despite the fact that a large coalition of 
consumers and service providers are actively working with Bown and Keeley to 
amend the prohibition language.

It would be extremely useful if the folks participating in the meeting on 
Thursday with the Governor let him know that taking choices away from 
businesses and customers is the wrong way to go and that he and the 
legislative leaders need to work with the coalition to fix it.  You'll note 
in the language developed by the coalition that the proposal strikes a 
reasonable balance between the Dept of Finance's concerns about recouping 
DWR's costs of buying power, and the need to give consumers and businesses 
maximum flexible in managing their energy costs.

Move to Have the State Take Over the Electric Industry in California

John Burton, the Democratic leader of the Senate, insists that, ""if 
California is going to 'bail out' the utilities, the State needs to get 
something in return.""  Burton wants the state to buy and operate PG&E's and 
Edison's transmission system and create a state power authority that would 
get in the business of (among other things) developing, financing, 
constructing and operating power plants and natural gas pipelines.  Burton 
got both of these bills designed to take over the industry passd out of his 
committee yesterday (SB6X and SB33X).  It is unclear how much support he has 
in the full Senate or in the Assembly, but the possibility of passage is 
certainly greater than zero at this juncture.

Others experts are offering a better alternative.  When the federal 
government helped Chrysler out of its financial difficulties 20 years ago, 
the federal government received stock warrants in return.  Until recently, 
the Governor favored warrants, but more recently he has waivered in his 
statements regarding a state take over.  Burton appears to have negotiating 
leverage with the Governor and appears to be using it.

Again, it would be extremely useful for folks to let the Govenor know in the 
meetings on Thursday that a State take over of the industry is an extreme 
move and bad public policy.  I will forward to you in a separate email 
letters that we sent to Burton expressing our opposition to his bills and the 
reasons for our opposition.  In brief, there is no shortage of private 
capital ready and willing to invest in California's energy infrastructure 
(i.e., power plants, electric transmission lines, gas pipelines).  All 
California needs to do is create the investment climate necessary to attract 
the capital.  In addition, history shows that the State is extremely 
ill-equipped to become California's mega-utility. 

Here are the attachments:

A demand buy-down proposal.  We made this proposal to the Governor (and 
continue to propose it to policymakers in Sacramento, Washington D.C. and 
just about everywhere else).  In short, the notion is that, if the market is 
willing to pay power producers, say, 7 cents/kwh to ""produce"" power, then the 
market ought to be willing to pay businesses and consumers 7 cents/kwh to 
""reduce"" power consumption.  

This approach is critical for two reasons:  first, it provides businesses and 
consumers the financial incentives necessary (and that California currently 
lacks) to conserve energy and use energy more efficiently.  Second, because 
California delayed identifying and implementing a solution to California's 
energy crisis, its options for addressing the severe shortages that are 
likely occur this summer are very limited.  Reducing demand represents one of 
the few options that can help to immediately reduce the gap between supply 
and demand.  Putting financial incentives in place now to reduce demand and 
""free up"" electrons is an investment with significant payback.

A ""manifesto"" recently released by a group of Berkeley and Stanford 
economists and industry experts urging the Govenor to pursue a 
""market-oriented"" solution to California's energy crisis.

An editorial in yesterday's Wall Street Journal by Dan McFadden, a nobel 
prize-winning economist from Berkeley echoing the proposal advanced in the 
""manifesto.""  McFadden was one of the manifesto's signatories.

Finally, we are working on ""model Legislation"" proposing a market-based 
solution that we will share with you soon and that we hope the business 
community--and the Valley in particular--can embrace and advocate.

I realize that this is a lot of information and I apologize for the length of 
this note, but I wanted to try to make sure that you're up-to-date.  Please 
don't hesitate to give me a call if you'd like to discuss further.

Jeff

A background document (which is a bit dated, but still useful). This is an 
internal document, so I would appreciate it if you would keep it confidential 
(though you are free to use the content in your own messages or documents).
A basic outline of solutions.
A summary of the Governor's recent executive orders. (It's another internal 
analysis.) I think these orders show a better understanding of the problems 
and solutions than we have seen before.  As we discussed on the phone, our 
biggest problem is inertia ... we don't have much time, many solutions have 
long lead times, and the political wheels grind slowly.

Jeff Dasovich: please forward any specifics on the demand buy down proposal 
and anything else that you think might be helpful background for Laura.",Jeff Dasovich Laura,,
1765,"Below is a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor 
Davis on 2/9/01.  

For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version:

These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things:

1.  Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of 
Existing Powerplants
2.  Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities
3.  Centralize Authority and/or Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting 
and Construction

The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting 
powerplants; and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full 
capacity.  (ie; the carrot and the stick)

They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators 
to sell their power under contract to the State Dept. of Water.

Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will 
be:

- How much capacity is truly ""idling"" and will be able to be brought back on 
line or increase its output?
- Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create 
flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to 
positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction 
and operation?
- How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and 
how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given 
the other issues in CA?

We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders, but wanted to get 
information to you in a timely manner.

D-22-01  Increased Output/Expedited Siting Mandates 
  
CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power 
generators. 
- limited to less than 50MWs using existing installed capacity b/w 
06/01-10/01/01 

Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal 
powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate.

Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed 
thermal powerplants.

Action by the State Water Resources Control Board  to insure wastewater 
issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating.

Requirements for the State Dept. of Water Resources to purchase power from 
powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not 
other market for their power.

Expires  12/31/01 unless extended

Analysis:

This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are 
currently not operating or not operating at full capacity.  It does not waive 
air quality requirements (they are addressed in a separate order).  

D-23-01  Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements

ISO Requirements:
- Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO
- Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly
- Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities
- Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide 
those records to Electricity Oversight Board
- Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below 
performance benchmarks est. by the ISO
- Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to 
impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities 
have fallen     below performance benchmarks est. by the ISO

Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and 
Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISO's ability 
to ensure adequate power during peak demand.

Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by 
utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability.

Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its 
authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est. 
benchmarks for availability and performance, and issue fines against those 
plants, after a hearing.

Analysis:

Again, the tone of this order is that the state won't tolerate outages as an 
excuse for not generating.  It is also an attempt to better manage planned 
outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants 
where off-line for maintenance at the same time.

D-24-01  Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures

Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of 
operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities 
that provide power under contract to the Dept. of Water Resources are not 
restricted in their ability to operate.
- Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable 
emissions in excess of the previous limits
- If air districts do not comply, the Board (CARB?) shall impose 
modifications on the permits in lieu of districts

The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions 
reductions from all available sources:
- Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need 
emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the 
Summer Peak Season in 2001
- In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to 
the Dept. of Water Resources, CA will make available where necessary and 
available the required emissions credits at up to a 50 percent reduction,
- In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity, 
emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to 
facilities where necessary and available.
- Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made 
available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the 
new or expanded facility is located.

Expires 12/31/2001 unless extended

Analysis:

This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours 
for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept. 
of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit 
bank available for use by other sources.  There are a lot of details that 
remain to be clarified, including how the state is going to locate emissions 
reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful.  However, it is a step 
in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive 
authority back to the state level.

D-25-01  Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants

Expedites review and approval of post-certification amendments to increase 
output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission.

Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes 
and regulations that normally control post-certifications to the extent that 
they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency.

Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of 
construction within one year of certification, and for the construction phase 
of the project.  Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy 
Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of 
the certification.

Expires 12/31/01 unless extended

Analysis

Again, no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and 
completed in a timely manner.

D-26-01  Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources

Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to 7 days for 
required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all 
powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission (under 50MWs) and 
that are proposed to be on line by summer 2001.

 Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways:
- Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants 
for construction and operation by July 31, 2001.
-Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO 
and can be online by July 2001 may also apply to be permitted by the Energy 
Commission under the emergency siting process.
-Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within 
four months, shall apply to any proposed simple-cycle thermal powerplant that 
can be brought on line by August 31, 2002  and that have an application for 
certification complete by Dec. 31. 2001.
-Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants, emission 
offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for 
certification
-The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites 
in the state and prepare a report by 02/21/01  identifying those areas of the 
state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to 
augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of 2003.

IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within 7 days of receipt 
of completed application.

Expires 12/31/01 unless extended.

1766,"I think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a
comprehensive solution is needed.  The only concern I have is the reference
at the end of the first paragraph to  ""the crisis grows daily with no clear
resolution offering long term relief in sight.""  In fact we do no have
several bills on demand side management, one by Wright on accelerating
repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary
conservation, at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery (AB-18X), and a
Bown bill to restore direct access rights compromised by AB-1X.  So I am
concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the
notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for a
long term solution.  Perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal
elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to
be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the
following elements....and then lay out our case.

Sandi, do you agree with my concerns?  Otherwise the elements of the letter
are fine, and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative
language.  I will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of
review, even though we may later want to consoliate the entire package.

so far they prefer to discuss by phone.   Their lawyers acknowledge that the 
primary issue for suppliers is credit.  They are working on an agreement with 
CPUC that would ensure that CDWR would have an adequate revenue stream to 
support the contracts.  Their intent is to make the supply contracts have 
priority over the bonds.  Until that happens, we maintain that we require a

Strike the last two sentences of Section 80110 that currently reads:



Insert the following language at the end of Section 80110:

The commission shall implement subscription protocols for the power supplied 
by the department in accordance with the following:
a) The right of residential and small commercial customers to elect an 
alternate provider for retail service shall not be restricted by this section.
b) The right of large commercial and industrial customers to elect service 
from an alternate provider for retail service shall not be limited until such 
time as the department has fully satisfied the net short position of the 
respective electrical corporation with long-term contracts.  The department 
shall provide public notice when the department has fully satisfied the net 
short position of an electrical corporation.  This event shall be deemed to 
be the close of the initial subscription period for the applicable electrical 
corporation.
c) If, after the initial subscription period has closed, a large commercial 
or industrial customer elects to leave the department service, the department 
may impose a fee equal to the incremental costs imposed on the portfolio that 
are directly related to the load of the departing customer.
d) Upon conclusion of the initial subscription period, the department shall 
notify all large commercial and industrial customers no less than six months 
in advance of the lapse of any long-term contract.  Upon such notice large 
commercial and industrial customers shall have the right to elect an 
alternate provider without being subject to the surcharge set forth in 
sub-section (c).  This event shall be deemed to be an open subscription 
period and shall remain in effect until such time as the aggregated demand of 
all customers electing an alternative provider exceeds the capacity of the 
lapsing contract.  This event shall be deemed to be an open subscription 
period.
e) If a large commercial or industrial customer requests service from the 
department after the initial subscription period or outside of an open 
subscription period, the department may impose a fee equal to the incremental 
costs imposed on the portfolio that are directly related to the load of the 
returning customer, taking into account prospects for load growth in its 
customer base, compared to the total value of the portfolio of energy used to 
serve the customer.  
f) Customers that have elected to take service from the department after the 
initial subscription period or outside of an open subscription period shall 
be required to take service from the department for a minimum of one year.
g) Any new customer to the service territory of an electrical corporation 
shall have the opportunity to elect service from the department without being 
subject to sub-section (e).
h) Any new customer shall have the opportunity to elect service from an 
alternative provider during the first 120 days from the date of service 
initiation without being subject to sub-section (c).
i) For purposes of this section, residential and small commercial customers 
shall be defined as customers with demands less than 100 kW.
j) For purposes of this section, commercial and industrial customers shall be 
defined as customers with demands equal to or greater than 100 kW.
k) For purposes of this section, a long-term contract shall be defined as a 
contract for energy greater than or equal to one-year in length.

Working Group 1 (WG1) -- Forward Contracts
An interim report was prepared from the work done in the various subgroups 
(attached)
By tomorrow, will have the final ready for the ""principals"" meeting 
tentatively scheduled for Saturday.
Final will include draft RFP, very agressive schedule ending with contracts 
signed by 1/31/01, draft standard contract, utilities' unmet load projected 
for 15 years,  and description of four products: 24x7; 6x16; capacity with 
monthly take or pays; and swing capacity.
The group will likely recommend two simultaneous RFP processes: (1) Davis' 
proposal -- what term and volume will you give me for 5.5 cents; and (2) bids 
with their own pricing and terms to meet the utilities' needs. 

Working Group 2 (WG2) -- Utility Debt
Working on a forbearance agreement

This group met for the first time Thursday evening.
Expected to try to negotiate less volatile (and lower) QF prices using 
long-term gas tolling agreements.

Status of Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts

MAJOR ISSUE FROM WEDNESDAY:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they 
want the State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that 
this had been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a 
forecast and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of 
the utilities. Rest of attendees oppose this approach.  No progress made.

1780,"Steve:

The CDWR idea has already been implemented. Today the ISO couldn't get supply 
from the market and informed market participants that CDWR would sleeve deals 
to the ISO. This occurred at a time when CA was in Stage 3 emergency (only 
the second one ever) and anticipating rolling blackouts this evening. Enron 
and other suppliers began to aggregate supply to sell to CDWR presumably to 
go to the ISO.  Belden was concerned that Gray Davis may just withhold 
payment through CDWR when settlements are due. This concern prompted us to 
require paper confirms for hourly deals and a discussion between Christian 
Yoder and Steve Hall (Stoel Rives) with the assistant director at CDWR to 
make sure CDWR management was on board - which they confirmed verbally. 
Regardless of all of this we still have some paranoia about getting paid. Is 
Gray Davis willing to confirm that no payment issue through CDWR will occur? 
We are currently continuing to aggregate supply through the day but are 
hesitant to increase quantities without such assurance. Other suppliers 
appeared hesitant as well as they wouldn't sleeve the deals to CDWR.",Steve Gray Davis Yoder Steve Hall Stoel Rives,,CDWR ISO Enron
1781,"Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay:

Urged us to ""stay at the table"".

Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from 
which to calculate offering prices).

QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight.
says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply).
believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased 
forward (perhaps by state entity).

Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost 
based at  4?/kwh.

If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new 
commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% 
of SCE supply).

Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this 
evening.

Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as 
high as 6.0?).

Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government 
facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution.

Thinks it's nearly a ""done deal"" that DWR (state entity) will buy power.

Says securitization may be harder to get.

Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear 
payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities 
over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the 
progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson.

Apparent   Process
Tuesday meeting gave two assignments to us.  
 (1)  Develop framework for auction for long-term contracts and resolving QF 
issues
 (2)  Develop framework for dealing with utility debt, including supplier 
""forbearance""

  (a) Timeline/Implementation
  (b) Utility Needs/Product definition/RFP development
  (c) Standard Contract Development
 -- Timeline -- I was the lead and we completed our assignment.  We agreed on 
an aggressive schedule   with power flowing by 2/1/01.  The process is set up 
for DWR, working with a consultant.  It's an   RFP rather than an auction 
process. The idea of a  mock auction was rejected.
 --  Product definition -- Much work needed here.  Major issue set forth 
below.
 -- Contract -- Most parties (including Enron) want to use the EEI standard 
contract.  Group working on   additional provisions.  Plan final contract by 
Friday.

 -- Report later

Major Issues from Long-Term Contracts

NEW MAJOR ISSUE:  Utilities revealed late on Wednesday that they want the 
State to assume the role of their portfolio manager and claimed that this had 
been their idea all along.  In their view, the utilities provide a forecast 
and the State takes on the entire risk of meeting the unmet load of the 
utilities.  They were unwilling to commit to any time frame.
Kind of Auction or RFP -- a.k.a What does the Governor really want?  Many 
people in the room believe that the Governor was firm in his demand for 5.5 
cent power for ALL the unmet load of the utilities.  We spent four hours 
debating these issues.  In the end, the parties felt that the best approach 
would be to have simulataneous auctions as follows:
 -- Separate bids for NP 15 and SP 15
 -- RFP 1 -- Suppliers submit bids for more than one product with a blended 
price of 5.5 cents.
 -- RFP 2 -- (Considered closest to the Gov's proposal) State sets price of 
5.5 cents and suppliers compete    on term and volume.
 --RFP3 -- Suppliers provide bids for any of the utilities' product needs and 
are free to bid any price,    volume or term.
 -- All RFPs would be conducted simultaneously.  Parties agree that RFP3 is 
most likely to get the
   greatest number of bids.

The Outlook

LOS ANGELES

Helmut Ackermann founded L.A. Dye & Print Works Inc. 18
years ago, when he took over a bankrupt dye house. Today,
thanks to California's worsening energy crisis, L.A. Dye &
Print is back on the brink of closure.

Mr. Ackermann depends on natural gas to operate the
massive boilers and heaters used to color and dry fabrics.
He expects his December gas bill to have jumped to
$600,000 from $132,000 last January. Hammered by the
soaring costs, he has already closed one plant and
dismissed 40 people. Now, he says the jobs of his
remaining 660 workers are in jeopardy. ""If it stays the
way it is, we won't be around very long,"" Mr. Ackermann
says.

Stories like this are causing economists to worry that
California's economic troubles -- the energy crisis,
combined with a high-tech shakeout and growing labor
unrest in the entertainment industry -- could put more
drag on a U.S. economy that is already downshifting.

The energy mess is ""one more negative added to the mix,""
says Tom Lieser, a senior economist at the University of
California at Los Angeles's Anderson Business Forecast. He
expects California to navigate its way through the
immediate crisis but worries about its longer-term impact.
Questions about the reliability and cost of the state's
power supply, for example, could threaten continued growth
of vital industries such as technology.

Some Wall Street economists worry that California's
problems could spill over and hurt the broader U.S.
economy. In a report titled ""California Unplugged -- A
Drag on Global Growth?"" Morgan Stanley Dean Witter warns
that California's energy crisis threatens to push up
production costs and make U.S. exports from the state,
which totaled $102.9 billion in 1999, less competitive on
world markets.

""Negatives tend to snowball, so what is happening in
California has the potential to exacerbate the weakness we
already are seeing in the U.S. economy,"" says Joseph
Quinlan, a Morgan Stanley economist.

Other states facing economic and financial trouble
wouldn't warrant such attention. But California not only
is the nation's largest state in terms of both population
and economic heft, but the Golden State also seemed to
epitomize the New Economy. Job growth in the state has
been double that in the nation as a whole; of the 2.1
million jobs created in the U.S. during the first 11
months of last year, one of every five new hires was in
California. The state produced more than $1.2 trillion in
output in 1999, making it the sixth-largest economy in the
world, slightly smaller than the economy of the United
Kingdom and a little bigger than that of Italy. The
state's economic output contributed about 12% of total
U.S. gross domestic product. New York, in second place,
had an 8.1% share of GDP.

But soaring energy costs are beginning to take a toll on
the Golden State, and low-end manufacturers are among the
first to see the change. ""It is forcing many of us to face
a shutdown,"" says Scott Edwards, president of the
Association of Textile Dyers, Printers and Finishers of
Southern California. His industry runs on gross profit
margins of 10% to 15%, hardly enough to handle the
fivefold increase in natural-gas costs that many operators
have witnessed.

Soaring energy prices also are hurting California's
agricultural industry. ""We can't pass along the costs of
production"" as some other industries do, says Heather
Flower, a spokeswoman for the Western Growers Association,
a group of 3,500 growers in California and Arizona. Some
are cutting back on plantings of broccoli, lettuce and
strawberries, among other crops, because of uncertainty
about costs.

Electricity prices already are on the march. The state's
largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co., received temporary rate increases
last week ranging from 9% for residential customers to 15%
for large companies. Some economists say the rises, if
they become permanent, could wipe out a large chunk of
per-capita-income gains and result in less consumer
spending.

On top of the energy problems, Hollywood is bracing for a
strike by the Writers Guild of America and the unions
representing film and television actors, whose contracts
are set to expire this year. The studios spent the end of
2000 jamming in production to cushion the impact of a
potential strike. The sector employs nearly 300,000 people
in the state.

While there seems little doubt that the troubles brewing
in California will prove painful, there are reasons to
believe the state can still avert an outright economic
contraction. Its economy is more diversified and resilient
than a decade ago, when national-defense cutbacks and an
overbuilt property market crippled the local economy. Back
then, jobs in the aerospace sector shrank by 70%, and
office-vacancy rates in major markets soared.

Also, despite all the attention being given to the state's
energy crisis, the fact is ""we're not a very
energy-intensive economy,"" says Ted Gibson, chief state
economist with California's department of finance. He
notes that the state ranks 48th among the 50 states in
per-capita energy consumption. And he adds that the $11
billion in deficit spending racked up by the two big
utilities amounts to less than 1% of state output. ""It's
not the kind of cost that will bring the state to its
knees,"" he says.

? SoCal Conference Call Highlights

SoCal Conference Call- The following comments are notes from the SoCal 
conference call for defaulted debt holders, held 1:30 p.m. PDT, 13 July 2001:

? Ted Kravner, the SoCal spokesperson, indicated that there are ""a lot of 
bills floating around.  There's not a lot for us to say at this point.""  
After such a long delay, he stated that, ""We are encouraged to see real 
action at the legislative level.""  Also, the company could not comment as to 
whether the plans made the utility creditworthy; ""We are evaluating that with 
Senate and Assembly leaders.""

? The spokesperson stated that on Monday the company will make a regular 
interest payments on the 5 7/8 notes totaling less than $6 M.  The company 
will also make payments on its other notes; the total amount to be paid will 
be $27 to $28 M.

? Yesterday the CPUC granted the company's motion on the QF fixed rate 
agreement with the gas cogen and renewable QFs.  The spokesperson stated that 
the PUC said SoCal can recover all costs associated with its payments to 
these QFs.


 Appalucia Management Questions to SoCal
 Q:   Will SCE defer payment on the ""quids"" notes, which are backed by a 
trust that has bonds issued against it?
 A:  Under the terms of the notes SoCal is allowed to defer payment for up to 
20 quarters.

 Q: Would the CPUC, after providing for the DWR to be reimbursed for 
purchasing power (through the California Procurement Adjustment, or CPA), 
leave enough revenue for SoCal to remain solvent?  This was based on reports 
in the press recently that the DWR had requested a 25% rate increase.  
 A: These reports were ""speculation"" and were based on numbers that DWR had 
submitted several weeks ago.  SoCal stated that DWR must update these 
numbers; therefore, no formal CPUC decision on reimbursing SoCal vis-.-vis 
DWR can be made at this time.  SoCal indicated that these numbers would be 
updated ""in a few weeks.""

 Prudential Questions to SoCal
 Q:  What bills are currently in process dealing with the MOU?
 A: There is the Polanco bill, which is the original MOU; the  Assembly 
(Hertzberg) bill AB 82XX, which uses the Polanco bill as its foundation; and 
a Senate bill crafted around Byron Sher's proposals.  SoCal stated that the 
Sher bill was ""less a matter of using Polanco"" and approaches the MOU ""from a 
different direction.""  SoCal indicated that ""people are currently studying 
the Hertzberg will to see what the components are.""

 Q: What is your (SoCal's) reaction to the negative article in the LA Times 
today regarding the legislature's perception of the MOU?  
 A: SoCal responded that ""the LA Times sees the glass as half-empty.  By my 
comments, I see the glass as half-full.  We are optimistic because there 
something tangible that people are working on.  The fact that Hertzberg's 
bill uses the governor's MOU as a foundation provides us with a level of 
optimism.""  However, he emphasized that the company was not in a position to 
say whether any of the bills would make the utility creditworthy.  

 Q: Can the governor keep the legislature from recessing in order to force 
them to pass an MOU?
 A: SoCal responded, ""yes, I understand that he does have that power.  We are 
running out of days.  The situation is becoming more critical.  We are on 
borrowed time from our creditors now.  Anything that moves us toward 
creditworthiness, we support.""  (NOTE:  In actuality, the Governor can order 
legislators to the floor for a vote, but they do not have to comply.  As 
Burton said in the press today, ""Only the legislature can force the 
legislature to stay."")

Deutsche Bank Questions to SoCal
 Q: Is the transmission asset sale off the table or not?  
 A: The sale is in the Assembly bill, but we ""think it's more of an option in 
the Senate bill, like it was in the San Diego deal.""

 Q: What are your (SoCal's) thoughts on how the California Procurement 
Adjustment (CPA) mechanism could be constructed to keep SoCal solvent and if 
a change in the mechanism for reimbursing the DWR would be needed?
 A:   ""We are highly focused on this.""  The spokesperson stated that if  
revenue is distributed in a manner ""that puts the utility in a deteriorating 
balance sheet situation, this will be seen as a very serious situation.  This 
would be unacceptable.  Our cash position is currently stable.  These 
changes, this would be a very serious event.""

 Q: Has SoCal reached an agreement on paying the non-renewables or gas-fired 
QFs 10% of what they are owed? 
 A: SoCal indicated that it is still in negotiations with 4 of the larger 
gas-fired QFs (IEP Projects).  SoCal indicated that it would make its 10% 
payments once the PUC order to pay is final (a 30-day appeal period is still 
in effect, according to SoCal).",Ted Kravner Polanco Byron Sher's Sher Burton,less than $6 M. $27 to $28,"SoCal Conference SoCal Senate Assembly CPUC QF PUC DWR the California Procurement Adjustment SoCal vis-.-vis Prudential Hertzberg LA Times the LA Times Deutsche Bank the California Procurement

1792,"The following are?summaries of today's appearance by  Sen. John Burton to the 
Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this  afternoon announcing a 
lawsuit against FERC.
?
John Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at  a?lunch with the 
Sacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about  the Edison MOU, 
which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee  for review, 
the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the  Natural 
Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.?  (One 
columnist commented that Burton would ""love it to death,"" meaning it would  
get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance.)
?
The MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight  by the PUC.? 
He said that will not be the case when it leaves the  Senate.
?
Burton is obviously troubled by?the MOU; he said ""some  people"" say it 
doesn't just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.?  He said the 
following would have to take place for the MOU to be  acceptable:
?

Back debt must be verified;
All creditors must take a 30% ""haircut"";
The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an  amount close to 
what the governor has mentioned;
$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay  back debt.

?
When asked whether $400 million was enough, he said ""no"" and  that he feels 
the parent should pay ""a ton.""? That led to a discussion of  the dedicated 
rate component, which he doesn't like.?He used  the example that if 
electricity costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is  $5, if prices drop 
to $10 people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.? A  larger infusion of 
cash from Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the  dedicated rate 
component. 
?
Burton called?the dedicated rate component a ""big  problem"" and said it could 
be the strongest argument for use in an initiative  campaign.
?
He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that  the state should 
set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything  more (note:? 
this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support  from radio talk 
shows and other media).? He later threw out the number  $200.? The state is 
going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top  dollar, he said, so this 
is one way he sees to fight back.? It's tough  medicine, but as he put it, 
""You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy,  but two days later 
you're over it and your stomach's OK.""
?
Burton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how  he believe the 
situation should be handled:? ""The only way to deal with  exploiters is to 
terrorize the bastards.""
?
Asked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU,  Burton said the 
MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing  progress there 
are allowances that would let the process go as long as into  December.
?
?
LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE
?
Shortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to  announce a 
lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the 
Ninth Circuit.? A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier  this 
afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.? If  
additional copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.
?
The plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the  Senate; Bob 
Hertzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City  of 
Oakland.? At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry  Brown, 
atty. Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty.  Clark 
Kelso, a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz  
Figueroa; and Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland.? 
?
The suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling  within 21 days.
?
Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not  fulfilling its 
statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.?  Hertzberg added 
that FERC had ignored the law and that they  were compelled to file suit for 
Californians' relief.
?
Joe Cotchett said the suit is ""very basic"" and is based on the  Federal Power 
Act, which he says limits power costs to ""fair and justifiable""  rates.??A 
primary?strategy in this suit is to present it as a  ""health and welfare"" and 
public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million  disabled children and 
12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely  affected by blackouts.? 
He said it is ""not an economic lawsuit -- it's  about senior citizens, 
disabled kids and convalescent facilities.""? Today  also happened to be the 
legislative day for the California Association of Health  Facilities (the 
nursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were  apparently 
asked to sit at the back of the room for effect.
?
Cotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were  opportunities 
to exert market power.? He also claimed that a Redondo Beach  facility 
(obviously AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant  off-line 
and substituting higher rates.? He said, however, that this order  had been 
sealed.
?
He cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of  blackouts this 
summer, which could mean four hours a day.? That could be,  he said, 
""potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in  refrigeration.""? Cotchett 
noted that only hospitals with more than 100 beds  are exempt from blackouts, 
which does not protect surgical centers or many  health facilities.
?
Jerry Brown added that ""prices are unjust and people are  suffering.""? 
Continued high prices could mean ""potential civic disruption,""  and that 
there will be ""more actions to mobilize"" Western mayors.
?
Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of  the lawsuit.
?
Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV  here as a 
legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy,  in 
his Press Club appearance.? He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the  
media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the  
suit.?Burton's lawyer's sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it  
to?join the legal team.
?
Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market  power for 
three years, and that the commission has delayed  action?unreasonably.? It 
has failed to define ""fair and justifiable"";  that failure, he said, violates 
the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of  the Constitution.
?
Kelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon  ""fellow 
Republicans"" to support the effort.
?
Joan Breuner (sp?), Oakland's vice mayor, said only that she  believed that 
if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than  California, the 
president and FERC would have acted long ago.
?
During the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing  is necessary 
because ""5 generators supply 90%"" of the electricity in CA and all  five have 
rate renewals before FERC.? He also said one of the cases that is  relevant 
is Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set  
standards (regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal  
Protection clause.? He also said six states have expressed interest in the  
case and have requested briefs:? Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington,  
Minnesota and one other he didn't name.? None of these states has yet  
committed to joining the suit.","John Burton Burton Phil Jim Steffes Scott Govenar Bob

Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who have also gouged California. 
""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind,"" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 million.

Davis sues Bush: If logic and science prevail, ethanol goes



(Published Aug. 15, 2001) 

It would be environmental and economic lunacy for California to blend oxygen-boosting ethanol into state gasoline supplies, as the federal government stubbornly and blindly requires. But for politically influential Midwestern farmers, the federal fuel rule is a pipeline into Californians' pocketbooks. They grow the corn from which ethanol is made. 

Last month, when the Bush administration rejected California's request to waive the fuel rule, it clearly sided with Midwestern farmers against California and common sense. Now, in defense of California's economy and its environment, Gov. Gray Davis has sued the federal regulators. Good for him. 

On the environmental side, California air regulators -- hardly slouches in the nation's clean air fight -- offer persuasive evidence that state refiners can produce a gasoline blend that exceeds federal clean air standards without using an oxygenate. MTBE, the oxygenate currently used in state gasoline, has been a source of serious water pollution. The Davis administration has wisely ordered a phaseout of MTBE by 2003. 

Studies show that ethanol, the most readily available alternative to MTBE, could actually harm California's air. While it reduces carbon monoxide like other oxygenates, ethanol increases soot and emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, the major ingredients in smog and the state's most persistent air pollutants. 

Ethanol imposes economic burdens as well. To produce an ethanol blend, refiners in California would have to convert their refineries at an estimated cost of $1 billion. That could add 3 cents to 5 cents extra to a gallon of gasoline at minimum. If the federal mandate remains in place, California's fuel needs would push demand for ethanol well beyond current supplies, driving prices up an additional 50 cents per gallon by some estimates. That would be an economic boon for Midwestern farmers, but a hardship for California consumers. In a state already reeling from an electricity crisis and a slowdown in its high tech sector, higher gas prices would be an unfair and unnecessary burden. 

California's message to the federal courts is simple: Let logic and science prevail. If that happens, California should win.



 

 

 

PUC turns spotlight on SDG&E debt deal

Hearing to examine plan negotiated by governor

By Craig D. Rose 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 

August 15, 2001 

Even though California has avoided rolling blackouts since May, for consumers, the electricity crisis hasn't disappeared. 

The California Public Utilities Commission has scheduled a hearing tomorrow at San Diego City Hall on the deal between Gov. Gray Davis and Sempra Energy, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, to do away with a $747 million debt racked up by customers. 

If paid in full, the debt will cost residential customers about $400 each and every business between $1,400 and $12,000. 

Consumer groups say the debt is fictitious -- the result of selective bookkeeping by SDG&E. The San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network says ratepayers really owe nothing. 

Here are the issues in the dispute: 

What is the deal between Davis and Sempra all about? 

When rates for SDG&E's electricity customers tripled last summer because of the state's deregulation law, the Legislature put a cap on customer payments. SDG&E continued to pay sky-high prices for power but could only collect a portion of those costs from customers. 

The company kept track of the shortfall in what is known as a balancing account. Davis and SDG&E have agreed on a plan to eliminate the debt and avoid charging customers a huge balloon payment. 

Consumer advocates say the plan amounts to ratepayer gouging. The deal requires PUC approval. 

What is the source of the dispute over the debt? 

It has to do with accounting, and it's a multimillion-dollar difference of opinion. 

A key disagreement is what should be done with hundreds of millions of dollars in profits SDG&E made by selling power during the crisis. The PUC twice this year said profits from two contracts should be returned to customers. 

UCAN says the profits amount to $450 million and says SDG&E misled the public by portraying itself as simply a distributor of power. The utility says the disputed contracts belong to stockholders and has refused to disclose their value. SDG&E points out that the agreement calls for it to contribute $219 million of the profits to the state and that the state has audited the contracts regularly. 

Didn't SDG&E say it was passing along the cost of power without any markup? So how did it make the profits? 

As required under law at the time, SDG&E bought power for its customers from the state Power Exchange and passed along those costs without markup. However, SDG&E was also selling electricity into the Power Exchange at that time. 

SDG&E says the PUC earlier allowed it to keep these gains. The commission says it never granted such approval and ordered the profits returned to customers. The company is challenging that order in court. 

What does the law say? 

Under the law passed last fall that capped customer payments to SDG&E, the utility is to be repaid for shortfalls, if it prudently purchased electricity. 

The law also states that any losses incurred by SDG&E should be offset by profits derived from buying less expensive power for its customers, such as the electricity purchased under the disputed contracts. 

If that's what the law says and the commission has already ruled on these profits, why isn't the matter settled? 

The deal worked out between Davis and Sempra Energy asks the PUC to reverse its earlier ruling and award the contract profits to company shareholders. 

Two more provisions are key: SDG&E says it will contribute $219 million to reduce the customer debt. But SDG&E will also earn an additional $120 million from selling power to the state from June till the end of the year. 

Why would the governor push to reverse a commission ruling that could bring even more to consumers? 

SDG&E has filed an appeal in state court to overturn the commission ruling on the power-sale profits. The utility says it convinced Davis' negotiators that it has a strong case and would win in court. If that occurred, none of profits would go to consumers. 

UCAN and the state Office of Ratepayer Advocates, an arm of the PUC, say it is unlikely that SDG&E would prevail. 

What does SDG&E say? 

The utility says the deal is a fair compromise and good for consumers because it eliminates the possibility of lengthy litigation over several issues. 

SDG&E obtained electricity at below-market rates over the past year because it entered into the power-buying contracts several years ago, before rates skyrocketed. SDG&E says that if energy prices had dropped and the contracts turned out to be a bad deal, the utility and its stockholders would be liable, not ratepayers. 

Conversely, when the contracts turn a profit, the utility contends its stockholders should benefit. SDG&E also points to the $319 million in concessions it agreed to in the pact with Davis -- $219 million in returned profits and an additional $100 million in penalties to settle unrelated charges that it improperly purchased power on customers' behalf. 

What do consumer groups say? 

UCAN says all SDG&E profits from selling power should be returned to customers. The group also says the $100 million in penalties is a good deal for the utility because state regulators had not finished their review of SDG&E purchasing practices. 

What happens tomorrow? 

The PUC will hold a hearing over the plan to resolve the debt. The meeting runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the San Diego City Council chambers, on the 12th floor of the City Administration Building, 202 C St. Members of the public can testify between 2 and 4 p.m. 

The commission is not scheduled to vote on the issue until Aug. 23. Other provisions of the Davis-Sempra agreement will be considered separately later this year. 

What's the deadline for paying the debt claimed by SDG&E? 

Under the law passed last fall, SDG&E must wait at least until the end of next year for payment of any undercollections. And the utilities commission can bump the payment deadline one more year to the end of 2003. 

Why are we dealing with this now? 

Both Davis and SDG&E said they were motivated by customer concerns over so large a debt hanging over consumers' heads. Political observers say Davis is eager to settle the debt now so it is less likely to be an issue when he seeks re-election next year. 

What does the city of San Diego say? 

Along with UCAN, the city intervened in the suit seeking to recover the disputed SDG&E profits for residents. But San Diego will not take a position on the proposed deal to settle the debt because it does not have sufficient information, City Attorney Casey Gwinn said.


 
 
 
 
 
 
SoCalEd owes $3.3 billion, raises specter of bankruptcy

ROSEMEAD, Calif. - The struggling utility Southern California Edison owes $3.3 billion for power and other costs, has only about $1.7 billion of cash, and may be unable to avoid bankruptcy if it does not get help, its corporate parent said on Tuesday in a regulatory filing. 

SoCal Edison, left nearly insolvent amid California's power crisis, remains ""unable to obtain financing of any kind,"" the parent, Edison International, said in its quarterly report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Deregulation left SoCal Edison and the larger Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unable to recoup their soaring wholesale power costs. 

SoCal Edison agreed in April with Gov. Gray Davis on a rescue plan, known as the ""Memorandum of Understanding,"" or MOU, which called on the state to buy the company's transmission assets and called for the utility to sell ratepayer-secured bonds. This required approval by the California legislature and the rate-making California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). 

The MOU expires on Wednesday, five days before the legislature returns from recess. Rosemead, California-based Edison is meeting with state officials in the meantime. 

""SCE's future liquidity depends, in large part, on whether the MOU is implemented, or other action by the California legislature and the CPUC is taken in a manner sufficient to resolve the energy crisis and the cash flow deficit,"" Edison said in the filing. 

""Without a change in circumstances ... resolution of SCE's liquidity crisis and its ability to continue to operate outside of bankruptcy is uncertain,"" it added. 

According to the filing, as of July 31 SoCal Edison owed: 

- $1.2 billion to power generators known as ""qualifying facilities;"" 

- $878 million to the California Power Exchange, a clearinghouse for electricity buyers and sellers, and the California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's power grid; 

- $531 million on matured, defaulted commercial paper; 

- $230 million of energy credits; 

- $400 million of two defaulted note issues. 

The latest filing shows a deterioration in the company's financial situation in the past three months. As of April 30, SoCal Edison owed $3.1 billion for power and other costs and had about $1.9 billion of cash, according to an earlier regulatory filing. 

Pacific Gas, a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , filed for bankruptcy protection on April 6.

Governor appointee liquidates stocks / DISCLOSURE: Her divestment was made after 'crusade'
Robert Salladay

The San Francisco Chronicle 
FINAL 
Page A.1

California 's chief environmental official and head of the agency that has purchased billions of dollars in power acknowledged yesterday that she recently owned stock in energy firms while they were selling electricity to the state. 

Mary Nichols was appointed by Gov. Gray Davis as secretary of the state Resources Agency, which has political control over the Energy Commission and the Department of Water Resources, both of which exert tremendous power over California energy policy. 

Stanley Young, a spokesman for Nichols, said the investments did not represent a conflict of interest, but Nichols nevertheless sold all the energy stocks two weeks ago ""when we realized there was this crusade"" to review the statements of economic interest filed by Davis administration officials. 

The disclosure comes amid a series of revelations about Davis appointees who have owned energy company stocks at the same time they were making energy policy or orchestrating the purchase of power for California . The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating possible conflicts within the administration. 

""It's a troubling pattern within the Davis administration,"" said Jim Knox, executive director of Common Cause, ""which seems to place a very low priority on identifying and avoiding potential conflicts."" 

Young said the energy stock belonged to Nichols' husband, John F. Daum, a partner in a Los Angeles law firm. Until two weeks ago, the couple owned stock in Enron, the world's largest energy trader, in power generators Williams Co. and Puget Sound Energy and in oil giant Chevron, all of which have financial interests in the workings of her energy-related departments. 

Nichols was not required to list the number of shares owned or the value of the energy stocks, only a range. According to her economic disclosure statement filed in March, the stock's value was somewhere between $40,000 and $400,000. 

Nichols and her husband have numerous other stock holdings, including substantial interests in Eli Lilly and Co., a pharmaceutical firm, Oracle, Time Warner, Worldcom Inc. long distance, Corning manufacturing and Wells Fargo Co. 

STOCKS BOUGHT BEFORE CRISIS 

The financial disclosure forms show that Nichols held her energy stocks well before California was plunged into crisis late last year when energy companies began charging unprecedented prices for power. The most recent purchase was her stock in Enron on May 24, 2000, listed at between $10,001 and $100,000, and the Williams Co. purchase on Aug. 9, 2000, also valued in the same range. 

The state Department of Water Resources has been steadily purchasing power for California consumers, filling a gap left by the financial failure of the state's investor-owned utilities. An estimated $43 billion in long-term power contracts have been signed, including one with Williams Co. The California Energy Commission has been working to speed construction of new power plants. 

Young said that Nichols' energy stock was sold to avoid the appearance of impropriety and that ""the secretary has absolutely no say over the individual purchase of energy or decisions on the siting of (power plants) or the negotiating of contracts."" 

'NO IMPROPRIETY HERE' 

""She is at an extremely high level in the development of the policies of departments under her purview,"" Young said. ""From that respect, there is absolutely no impropriety here regarding her holding these stocks."" 

State law requires that public officials stay clear of decisions that could affect their investments. But many exceptions are made, including if the public official avoids work or public statements that might directly change the value of their stock holdings. 

""(Nichols) has control, but the key is whether she is actually making decisions with regards to energy contracts or purchases,"" Knox said. ""If she was in a decision-making capacity, then she would have conflict."" 

$311 MILLION DEAL WITH WILLIAMS 

A review of the first three months of spot market purchases by the state shows that the Department of Water Resources bought just over a million megawatts of power from Williams for $311 million. The average price worked out to be $278 a megawatt hour. 

The agency also bought 246,800 megawatts of power from Enron for $45 million, or an average of $181 a megawatt hour. Puget Sound sold California 100 megawatts during the height of the power crisis in January for $40,000, or $400 a megawatt hour. 

Puget Energy Inc. is the holding company for Puget Sound Energy, a regulated utility providing electric and gas service to Western Washington, and InfrastruX, which provides contracting services to the electric power, telecommunications and natural gas industries. 

The reports also showed that Nichols owned between $10,001 and $100,000 in General Electric Co. stock, but Young could not immediately confirm whether the stock was sold two weeks ago by Nichols and her husband. The stock was purchased in December 2000. 

G.E. is a major manufacturer of gas turbine generators that are in short supply and vital for the operation of power plants being built around California . 

Without commenting on whether Nichols violated any ethics rules, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the state Fair Political Practices Commission has ultimate authority over any possible conflict with any state official.

Pricing plan is guilt by association / BILLING: New system backfires on thrifty homeowners group

Emeryville's Watergate Community Association is no energy hog, although it's being treated like one. 

Timothy Sutherland, general manager of the homeowners group, has been dimming hallway lights, installing motion sensor light switches and screwing in low-wattage bulbs -- all in hopes of cutting back energy use. 

It has worked. He's shaved off about 10 percent in electricity usage compared with a year ago. 

But he just about had a heart attack when he saw the June bill from Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the same kind of shock being felt throughout California this summer as many homeowners associations peek warily at their PG&E bills. 

Sutherland's June bill doubled to nearly $30,000, and he can blame the California Public Utilities Commission, which in May approved a five-tier electricity -rate increase designed to punish power hogs. 

But the 1,249-home Watergate is more of a miser than a hog -- so why the humongous bill? It's a classic Catch 22. Because all of the Watergate's common-area power usage is routed into just 11 PG&E meters and because each of those meters has relatively low baseline levels, the excess electricity is being charged at much higher amounts. 

In the past, those meters didn't even have baseline amounts. Now, with the new five-tier rate system, the same meters are alloted baseline levels similar to a single-family home's. Go over those baselines -- and the Watergate does by leaps and bounds -- and your electricity bill goes through the roof. 

""Once they made that decision, they threw the baby out with the bathwater,"" Sutherland said of the PUC. ""It's completely unfair. . . . It's a way of saying common interest developments must pay the highest (energy) rate allowed by law."" 

Homeowners associations that manage large condominium buildings or townhouse complexes with lots of amenities, such as power-draining swimming pools, are being hit the hardest. 

""We're starting to get calls from our members,"" said Karen D. Conlon, president of the California Association of Community Managers. ""Basically, people are saying their ( electricity ) bills have doubled."" 

California has 33,000 homeowners associations, and about 8.5 million residents are believed to be a part of one, she said. 

Because annual budgets are already set for most associations, managers are left to dip into reserve funds while stalling renovation projects and freezing staff hiring, Conlon said. 

Unless the PUC comes up with a solution quickly, the increased costs would inevitably be passed on to residents when new budgets are set for next year, she said. 

BOOSTING FEES 

In San Francisco, at least one condominium complex has increased the monthly homeowners association fee by 10 percent to cover electricity bills that have skyrocketed by 80 percent. 

""If we didn't, we would have a deficit,"" said Pat Clock, general manager at Opera Plaza, which has 451 units in three separate towers on Van Ness Avenue and Turk Street. ""And that's what a lot of people are doing around here."" 

At the Watergate buildings, under the new tiered system, each of the 11 meters was allotted only 7.7 kilowatt hours of baseline power per day in June and 10.4 kilowatt hours in July. The baseline takes into account variables such as climate and season. 

But with 7,098 light bulbs illuminating 6.4 miles of hallways, 27 elevators, 27 building lobbies and stairwells; 45 light fixtures shining on four streets and 353 parking spaces; lighting for six parking garages with 1,300 parking spaces and a 20,500-square-foot bayfront boardwalk, Watergate is way beyond the top tier of 300 percent above the baseline. 

In June, when the new baseline levels went into effect, Watergate's usage was 5,000 percent over the limit, and in July, more than 4,000 percent over the baseline. 

""It doesn't make any sense. We don't mind paying more if we use more, but if we use less than prior years, we shouldn't be paying more,"" Sutherland said. 

PLEA FOR HELP 

Last month, he fired off letters detailing Watergate's woes to the state PUC, PG&E and state public officials, including Gov. Gray Davis. 

So far, nobody has written back. 

Representatives of both PG&E and the governor's office told The Chronicle that it is a PUC problem. 

Paul Clanon, the PUC's energy division director, called the conundrum an ""unintended"" consequence. 

""Nobody anticipated (this) was going to happen,"" Clanon said. ""I wouldn't point any fingers. . . . We understand the problem and we're looking at how to fix it."" 

The PUC has received numerous complaints from managers of homeowners associations, Clanon said. The issue will be addressed in public hearings later this year as the commission grapples with a variety of complaints about the new tiered system. 

ADJUSTING THE BASELINE 

Many argue that the baseline levels need to be reformulated because they haven't been updated since 1994. 

One possible solution for homeowners groups is to simply give them higher baselines, said Clanon. But until there's a fix, the bills will have to be paid. And refunds down the road aren't in the cards, he said. 

Not all homeowners associations are griping. 

At the mammoth Woodbridge Village Association in the Orange County community of Irvine, encompassing 9,000 single-family homes, Executive Director Bob Figeira isn't fretting. 

Despite having 50 swimming pools, 35 parks, 24 tennis courts, 11 volleyball courts and two lakes, the local grid is divided among more than 100 electric meters -- each with separate bills. 

""We're all divided, so each one of those meters uses less power than a single home,"" Figeira said. ""But I could see how some associations might have some big problems. . . . Some of these (associations) will go broke if it goes on like this.""

Bush names Texan to chair energy panel

Page A.9

President Bush completed a long-expected change of leadership at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday by naming his friend and fellow Texan Patrick Wood III as chairman of the much- criticized agency that oversees the nation's energy system. 

Wood, nominated to the commission by Bush in April, will replace Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., who announced last week that he will resign Aug. 31. 

In an interview with The Chronicle, Wood agreed with critics who say the agency has failed to monitor and respond to market abuses by energy firms -- a problem he says he will address immediately. 

""It requires a certain level of aggressiveness that we have not done,"" Wood said. 

The soon-to-be chairman said he is already working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to add $6 million to next year's regulatory commission budget. Wood said he will use the money to hire traders and other energy company employees to work for the government as watchdogs. 

""The best kind of hire would be someone who has done this on the other side,"" he said. 

By appointing Wood, Bush installed an ally at the helm of the agency, which has been sharply criticized for not responding to skyrocketing energy prices in California and the West over the past year. Wood was chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission when Bush was governor. 

Wood has also found an unlikely ally in Gov. Gray Davis, who has bashed federal regulators but praised the Texas regulator as someone who could improve the agency's response to the state's energy woes. 

""The governor has generally felt that Pat Wood has been very open and receptive to at least listening to what California 's issues are,"" said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Davis. 

Wood said yesterday that his job had been made easier by the efforts of California consumers to conserve energy. He praised the governor, the utilities and the California Public Utilities Commission for their efforts to stave off blackouts. 

""I've been proud of what California has done in terms of energy conservation,"" Wood said. ""I think that's going to be the story of the summer."" 

But Wood also praised what he called the ""much-vilified Texas generators"" for keeping their plants running to keep power flowing to the electricity grid. 

Despite his cozier relations with the state, Wood may clash with Davis and other California leaders on some key issues. 

Those include California 's claim it is owed $9 billion in alleged overcharges for electricity , an issue before a regulatory commission administrative law judge. 

""If the parties want to settle, fine,"" Wood said. ""We've given them a deadline. . . . We just need to do that and get it over with and move on to something more positive and future-oriented.""

Enron's CEO Steps Down After 6 Months Energy: Jeffrey K. Skilling cites personal reasons for his abrupt departure, which follows several setbacks for the power giant.
THOMAS S. MULLIGAN

NEW YORK -- Jeffrey K. Skilling stunned the energy industry by abruptly resigning Tuesday as chief executive of energy-trading giant Enron Corp., barely six months into a job for which he'd been groomed for years. 

Skilling's departure follows a series of setbacks for Enron, including seeing its huge investment in the fiber-optic telecommunications sector turn sour and facing accusations of electricity price-gouging in California . The company's stock price has lost half its value this year. 

Skilling, 48, called his resignation ""a purely personal decision"" having ""nothing to do with Enron."" 

By leaving voluntarily, Skilling will forfeit a severance package that would have been worth several million dollars. The normally outspoken Skilling declined to offer further explanation, prompting analysts to ask whether another shoe might drop. 

Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay told reporters and analysts in a conference call Tuesday evening that he would immediately assume Skilling's duties and extend his own employment contract by two years, through 2005, to provide ample time to craft a succession plan. 

Skilling and Lay were the main architects of Enron's spectacular transformation from a natural-gas pipeline firm into a lean, high-tech trader of everything from oil to wood pulp to pollution credits. 

Though solidly profitable and much admired for its innovativeness, Enron has stumbled lately and seen its stock price decline from a peak of $90.75 last August. 

Shares of Houston-based Enron closed at $42.93 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, up 78 cents. However, the stock tumbled in after-hours trading on word of Skilling's resignation, which came after the market close. 

A major setback has been the near-collapse of the telecommunications sector, where Enron had made a big push into the trading of fiber-optic bandwidth. A promising start for that business quickly turned into losses that reached $102 million before taxes in the quarter just ended. 

""It's very clear that they have been struggling with their business model of late,"" Raymond James analyst Frederick Schultz said Tuesday night. 

Enron is one of the independent power suppliers accused by California officials of price-gouging during the state's electricity crisis. In the meantime, however, natural gas and electricity prices have fallen, and Wall Street has grown concerned that federal efforts to push for energy price caps will affect long-term growth. 

Skilling's sudden departure may anger some institutional investors, Schultz said, since the executive has spent time in recent months wooing mutual funds and pension funds to invest in Enron stock. 

The analysts and reporters for the trade publications that follow Enron most closely seemed flummoxed by Tuesday's developments. 

Curt N. Launer of Credit Suisse First Boston asked whether the company anticipated filing ""any disclosure to tell us any other items behind this surprising news."" 

""There's nothing to disclose,"" Skilling replied. ""The company's in great shape."" 

Prudential Securities analyst M. Carol Coale found Skilling's timing odd, in that he was recently engaged to be married and has just completed construction of a large home in Houston. 

""Something's just not sitting right with me,"" she said. ""It seems odd that he would walk away from a severance worth millions."" 

Lay explained during the conference call that the severance pay called for in Skilling's contract, which expires in 2003, does not take effect if the separation is voluntary. 

Skilling last year cashed in stock options for gains of $62 million, according to Enron filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Lay's gains were nearly double that, at $123 million in 2000, according to the documents. 

Such cash-outs were part of the cause of a volatile exchange between Skilling and Boston-based analyst Richard L. Grubman of Highfields Capital Management during a conference call in April to discuss Enron's first-quarter earnings. 

After Grubman criticized Skilling for not having certain financial information available, Skilling fired back, calling the analyst a vulgar name. 

""He's got some nerve,"" Grubman said afterward, according to the Toronto Globe & Mail. 

Top Enron executives sold 7 million shares at prices in the $70s and $80s, Grubman said, adding, ""Now the stock is in the high $50s, low $60s and I'm an . . . because I ask about the balance sheet?"" 

Lay, who was Enron chief executive for 15 years before giving way to Skilling in February, has been scrutinized recently for his close political ties to the Bush administration. 

Lay acknowledged Tuesday that he has met once this year with Vice President Richard Cheney and had two telephone conversations with President Bush's top political aide, Karl Rove. 

However, ""most comments about my influence on energy policy or on the administration are grossly exaggerated,"" Lay said. 

Lay insisted that Skilling's decision should not be seen as a sign of a conflict over Enron's strategy. 

""There is absolutely no change in our business direction or business strategy,"" Lay said, noting that he and Skilling had been working together to formulate the strategy since the 1980s, when Skilling was still a consultant at McKinsey & Co. 

Analysts said Skilling may have chafed at the length of time it took him to finally be elevated to chief executive. They believe he forced Lay's hand last year by putting out word with analysts that he had been offered another post in London. 

Whatever personal issues may have influenced Skilling's resignation, the job was doubtless a pressure cooker. 

Skilling spent part of last week in England, offering the company's condolences on the death of three workers killed in an explosion at an Enron-owned power plant there. 

The company also has been embroiled in a long dispute with the Indian state of Maharashtra over that government's refusal to buy power from an Enron-backed plant.

California Edison Hangs Hopes on Sacramento Utilities: Execs say debt load can't be eased without legislative help. A deadline passes without action.

Legislative action in the next month probably will determine whether Southern California Edison escapes filing for bankruptcy, executives at the troubled electric utility said Tuesday. 

Edison executives said they were resigned to seeing the original deadline for state lawmakers to craft a rescue plan expire today without action but expected lawmakers to address the issue when they return to Sacramento on Monday. 

Theodore Craver Jr., chief financial officer of Edison International, the utility's corporate parent, said the next few weeks will prove crucial as the Legislature heads for its next recess Sept. 15. 

""We need legislative or regulatory relief to get the revenue to pay"" back debt, Craver told creditors in a conference call. 

The Legislature adjourned last month without agreeing on a rescue plan for the Rosemead-based utility, which piled up billions of dollars in losses on power sales when energy prices spiked late last year and earlier this year. 

The state Senate passed a bill last month that would allow SCE to pay off $2.5 billion of its debt through collections from ratepayers but still leave the company with about $1.4 billion in debt and interest charges that it would have to finance on its own. SCE, which has about $1.7 billion in cash, said such a plan would leave it short of the investment-grade credit ratings it needs to refinance debt and conduct business. 

Besides paying off its back debt, Southern California Edison also needs to have the state change the rules of deregulation to allow the utility to routinely recover what it pays for electricity as wholesale prices rise or fall, Craver said. 

Credit-rating and Wall Street analysts agree that without such a legislative change, investors would be reluctant to lend the company money because a sudden rise in the cost of power could tip the utility back into insolvency. 

An Assembly proposal would be more generous, allowing the utility to use ratepayer-financed bonds to cover all but $500 million of its past debt. The bill has passed through several committees but has yet to be voted on by the full Assembly. 

An earlier agreement between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis called for the state to buy SCE's transmission lines for $2.8 billion and issue ratepayer-supported bonds to pay off its remaining debt. Under terms of that agreement, the Legislature was to have passed enabling legislation by today, but the plan failed to gain the support of lawmakers. 

Separately Tuesday, the utility filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission warning--as it has for months--that without state action it could be headed into U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 

SCE said it had a total of $3.3 billion in unpaid and overdue debts as of July 31. That includes $1.2 billion to a group of generally small or alternative-power generators known in the industry as qualifying facilities; $878 million to the California Power Exchange, the now-defunct power market in which the utilities and large independent power generators did business; $931 million in defaulted notes and bonds; and $230 million in other debt. 

After factoring in its cash holdings, SCE has a deficit of $1.9 billion, the company said in its filing. 

Consumer advocate Doug Heller said Edison's bankruptcy alarms are intended to pressure the Legislature and Public Utilities Commission into approving a plan to pay off the utility's debts. 

""It's pretty clear that they will use the threat of bankruptcy to get as much money out of ratepayers as they can,"" said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights, a Santa Monica-based activist group. 

Despite the dire warnings by Edison, its financial situation has improved because of a rate increase of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour that went into effect in June and declining prices for natural gas, a key component in generating electricity . 

Nevertheless, the utility has told the PUC that it fears another rate increase will be needed to cover its own power costs, the projected electricity costs of the California Department of Water Resources and other transition costs. The water agency has been buying electricity for SCE and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. since mid-January, when the utilities ran so low on cash that generators refused to sell to them. 

SCE, PG&E and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric, in filings Tuesday with the PUC, again called for public hearings on the water agency's revenue needs. 

Pacific Gas & Electric said Tuesday that the agency had vastly overestimated the amount of money it needs to pay for the agency's power purchases. The San Francisco-based utility said the state overestimated both the price of power on the spot market and how much natural gas will cost in future years. 

Shares of Edison International rose 8 cents to $14.06 on the New York Stock Exchange.

THE NATION Bush Selects Ex-Texas Regulator to Head FERC

WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Tuesday named Patrick H. Wood III, a former Texas utility regulator with a pragmatic, hands-on style, to be the next chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 

Akin to a national utilities commission, FERC has the power to set wholesale electricity rates, making it a key player in California 's efforts to recover from the energy crisis. But the commission initially took a hands-off approach, drawing bitter criticism from state officials. 

In June, FERC finally imposed price limits throughout the West, while also ordering generators to sell any available power when needed. Wood--then a new commissioner--helped create the consensus for that decision, which has been cited for helping to ensure an unexpectedly calm summer. 

Wood is an advocate of electricity deregulation who nonetheless believes that markets must be closely policed and government should intervene if consumers aren't benefiting. 

""Pat Wood is someone who accepts the proposition that markets have to be constructed,"" said Mark Cooper, a regulatory expert at the Consumer Federation of America and frequent FERC critic. ""He understands that markets are not born as mature adults--they can go very wrong and when that happens, they have to be disciplined."" 

Wood said Tuesday that his main goal will be to help deregulated electricity markets take root in all 50 states. About half the states have taken steps toward deregulation, but many are holding back in view of California 's problems. Wood said he would also ask Congress for authority to set up regional market monitoring offices around the country. 

""My top one priority is to get competitive energy markets in this country,"" Wood said. ""That is what I am about. That is what I was picked for. To do that, we need to be credible, adept and open-minded. . . . People may not care about who we are, but they do care about what happens as a result of what we do."" 

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a leader on energy issues in the state's congressional delegation, welcomed Wood's appointment. ""As a sensible problem-solver, Pat Wood places practicality over ideology,"" Feinstein said in a statement. Wood ""will hopefully give some needed teeth to an agency that for far too long has delayed in coming to the aid of California ."" 

Since being confirmed as a commission member by the Senate in late May, Wood, 39, has taken an increasingly active role at the agency. A longtime political ally of the president, Wood was immediately chosen by Bush to be his special intermediary to California Gov. Gray Davis. 

Wood also made common cause with FERC Commissioner William L. Massey, a Democrat who for months had been the lonely advocate of a more activist role. Wood's arrival shifted the balance of power on the five-member commission toward those who favored intervention to head off further problems in the West. 

When FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. announced last week that he would resign at the end of the month, it cleared the way for Wood's long-expected promotion. Separately, Entergy, a New Orleans-based energy conglomerate, announced Tuesday that Hebert will join its ranks as a senior lobbyist. 

Industry officials also said they were pleased with Wood's appointment, which will take effect Sept. 1 and does not require further Senate action. 

As chairman, Wood will set FERC's agenda and oversee a staff of 1,200 with a budget of $175 million. But his honeymoon may be short-lived, as he faces resistance on several policy fronts. 

For example, with regard to California , FERC is unlikely to order anything like the $9 billion that Gov. Davis is demanding in refunds from power producers. 

And the agency is on a collision course with the governor over the independence of the nonprofit entity that operates the state's electric grid. Under a new California law, Davis appoints the governing board of the California Independent System Operator. But FERC policy requires the board to be insulated from political control. 

""Stay tuned,"" Wood said. ""That's not anything I'm willing to discuss at this point.""

New FERC Chairman Appointed

President Bush yesterday named fellow Texan Pat Wood III to be chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, putting an unconventional ally at the head of the federal agency that oversees the restructuring of the nation's electricity industry. 

Wood, the former chief energy regulator in Texas, was appointed a FERC commissioner by Bush and joined the agency in June. But his appointment as chairman had to await the resignation of Chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr., which takes effect at the end of this month. 

A strong advocate of energy deregulation, Wood has surprised some industry officials and analysts by pushing for around-the-clock electricity -price restraints in California and other western states, and supporting California 's bid for refunds from power suppliers. 

Yesterday, Wood said he wouldn't discuss his plans for FERC until after he talks with its other commissioners. ""I want us to do the agenda as a team as opposed to a Pat Wood show."" 

But he said there is a clear need to strengthen FERC's oversight and investigative staff to see that the deregulation of electricity produces competition, not monopoly profits. ""People say, 'He's not for free markets.' Yes, I am. But we have to get there first. 

""At the beginning of a market it's like a teenager. The parents let you out with the car, but they stay up all night until the kids get home. And one day it all works.""

1802,"""Plan B""
As folks know, there's a group of moderate Democrats in the CA Assembly that 
has been working on a ""Plan B.""
They've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the Governor's 
MOU with Edison.
The Plan B group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders, including 
Republicans, to get input into how ""Plan B"" can improve upon the MOU.
First the good news about Plan B:  a fairly bright group of legislators is 
rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to 
the problem, and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be 
bi-partison about it.  (There is at least one idea in Plan B that is 
attributable to a Republican--Keith Richman--that Ken Lay met with a couple 
of weeks ago.) So the beginnings of a process to resolve California's crisis 
may be emerging.
Now the bad news:  because they are trying to build a consensus, Plan B is a 
mish-mash, isn't focused, includes some pretty bad ideas, excludes some good 
ideas (like re-establishing Direct Access immediately), and is going to 
require a lot more work to get right.
Update on Efforts to Achieve a Settlement
In the meeting with the suppliers that Steve Kean and I participated in 
yesterday, one of the financial consultants hired by the Governor criticized 
several of the Plan B proposals as unworkable.
On today's call with the Governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat 
apparent that the Governor isn't going drive a resolution, but will leave it 
to the Legislature to take the lead role.
The staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits, investigations, etc. were 
not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks, and that 
attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter.
Instead, the Governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of 
the discount that suppliers would be willing to take.
The suppliers pushed back, stating that including haircuts in the talks while 
excluding the lawsuits, investigations, etc. is one-sided and unworkable.
The staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the Legislature, but 
made it fairly clear that the Governor would not be the one to pull the 
necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution; his staff 
implied instead that it's up to others, i.e., the suppliers, to get the 
process of negotiations underway.
Next Steps
If the Governor's financial consultants are prepared by Friday, they will 
brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to 
resolve the State's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power 
deals with CDWR.  It they are not ready by Friday, the suppliers will meet 
separately to discuss next steps.
Finally, there's been some confusion.  My apologies.  
Sandi faxed to Jim and Harry yesterday a copy of ""Plan B.""  Sandi mentioned 
that the Governor gave the Plan B group an analysis of the Plan.  For those 
that have a copy of Plan B, see the 10-page memo dated May 12th, attached to 
the back of the Plan.  The memo is from Joe Fichera to John Dutra, Fred 
Keeley and Joe Nation (3 of the Plan B Democratic legislators).  Joe Fichera 
is the head of Saber Partners, a financial consulting group that the Governor 
hired to advise him on the crisis.  
If anyone has not yet received a copy of Plan B, please let me know and I'll 
get it to you.

What do you think about sending the information Jeff prepared for McNealy to

Ken needs to meet with the UC Chancellor while he's in LA (probably around 
lunchtime), but are there any other meetings you think he should have while 
he's in California?  

For a briefing package, I'm putting together info (bios, company info) on all

1808,"California State Treasurer Phil Angelides held a press  conference this 
afternoon to announce that $3.5 billion in interim financing has  been 
arranged through J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers, and that an additional $1  
billion in financing is expected to be completed next week from an 
undisclosed  source.
?
The financing is in conjunction with an executive order issued  yesterday by 
the governor that allows bond?sales for energy purchased by  the Department 
of Water Resources.? Previously, Gov. Davis and Treasurer  Angelides had 
sought legislative approval of the bond issuance, but were not  successful.? 
Further review by state attorneys determined that the governor  could 
authorize the issuance of bonds by executive order with the difference  that 
the bonds can only be used for energy purchases going forward and cannot be  
used?to backfill past general fund expenditures.? 
?
A one-page?handout summarizing the financing has been  sent to Houston.??The 
vital statistics are:

The authorized loan amount is $5 billion, with an initial  $3.5 billion 
committed;
The rate is 4.75%, but will jump to 7% if the bonds are not  issued 
successfully by October 31, which is the scheduled maturity date of the  loan 
(Angelides emphasized that this is not the due  date).

The goal of the financing is to stem the flow of funds from  the general fund 
for power purchases and avert a cash crisis.? The  financing, which also 
provides working capital for continued?state energy  purchases,?is secured by 
revenues from electricity sales and will be repaid  by the bonds.
?
Angelides noted that the financing, which he hopes to have  totally closed by 
July 1, precludes generators from walking away from contracts  under the 
clause that requires financing by a certain date.? He said it  satifsies 
""most"" DWR contracts and?precludes arguments made by generators  for a 
""credit premium.""
?
Angelides also said that the financing is important because it  ""builds 
momentum"" for the huge revenue bond sale and that it ""sends a powerful  
signal to Wall Street that the bond issue is real.""
?
According to his figures, the general fund is currently out  about $5.2 
billion net ($6.1 billion in purchases minus $900 million in  revenues) in 
power purchases through June 12.
?
Steps still must occur before the bonds can be issued, he  said.? The PUC has 
to adopt rate agreements, adopt a servicing order with  the utilities to 
collect revenues to repay the bonds, and has to enact rate  increases of 
about 3 cents/kwh in SDG&E's territory.? Angelides noted  that the lenders 
have made their financial commitment event though these PUC  actions are 
still outstanding.
?
The bonds will not be issued until early September.?  Angelides said late 
August is a terrible time because the financial community is  on a pre-Labor 
Day holiday and that the state would hold off until the more  favorable 
period following the holiday.
?



?
Earlier in the afternoon, the Foundation for Taxpayer and  Consumer Rights -- 
Harvey Rosenfield's group -- held a press conference to voice  opposition to 
the Edison MOU.? They all seem to agree that the MOU is  likely dead, but are 
afraid of it arising at a later date in some form.  
?
When asked about the business community being asked to  shoulder the costs of 
utilities' debt, Rosenfield said that a problem has arisen  in that business 
wants direct access but DWR has already purchased the power  they ""don't 
want.""? He believes Edison alone should be responsible for its  debt; it's 
government's role to go forward, he said, and Edison's job to ""clean  up its 
mess.""
?
Rosenfield cautioned that if legislators ""make the mistake of  paying one 
more penny"" towards a bailout there will be a referendum on the  bailout and 
the legislators voting for it.? He said they would be  held personally 
accountable.
?
(Exactly what he means by this is unclear.? In  California, a ""referendum"" -- 
which is the word he used -- is a little-used tool  to overturn legislation 
that has been passed and signed.? Whether he was  threatening recall attempts 
is also unclear.)
?
Rosenfield added that depending on how things progress, there  could be an 
initiative and it could include a public power  component.
?
The press release issued at the press conference, which also  featured Harry 
Snyder of Consumers Union, has been forwarded to Houston.?  It is also 
available through this link:

1809,"Hertzberg called.  We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us 
to build for him.  I've attached the file.  the supporting spreadsheets are 
not included.  If folks would like them, let me know.  Please keep the file 
confidential.  

Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers 
if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to 
noncore customers.  
Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases 
when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to 
businesess (i.e., to noncore).  (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is 
below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.)
Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates 
significantly above the Lynch rates.  
Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that 
it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by 
the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates 
again soon. 
In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which 
will require yet additional increases.
I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or 
tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail  (he would still like to put 
100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive 
market and out from under Loretta).
I will report back after we've spoken.
All ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome 
and appreciated.

I have previously forwarded to you the Gramm changes that I received from Ken

through the changes to see if they are beneficial to Enron.

For example, the changes being made to solve the ""Blackbird Issue"" (see p. 29 
and 30 of Gramm's changes) seem to be beneficial for Enron Online.  Also, 
Gramm's Swap exclusion language of section 107 seems broader than the 
existing language.

If Gramm were to ask Ken Lay if we were supportive of these changes how would 
we respond?  I have a hunch our response is that a perfect bill would be 
ideal, but it is not likely that such a goal is attainable in this Congress 
or the next Congress.  Nonetheless, I would appreciate help listing the 
changes that are helpful to enron and those we just don't care about.

I looked at the specific industry for the companies that you requested and then I backed up to the ""Overview"" for the industry.

In ""The Center for Responsive Politics"" website, the ""Top Recipients"" are based on contributions from PACs, soft money donors, and individuals giving $200 or more. Due to the voluminous nature of the Top Recipients listed, I printed them out and they are available for your perusal.  On the spreadsheet, I continued the analysis on the Top Recipients and what was donated, in the election cycles 1998 - 2000, across the 3 industries.   Because you asked for a combination of Oil & Gas Companies and Electric Utilities, I showed Electric Utilities and Oil & Gas data, separately and then combined.  

Numbers that are listed in ""bold"" indicate the group who had the largest donations within each research area.  The split on the ""Top Presidential Democrat and Republican Candidates"" are calculated from the ""Overview of Sectors '98 - '00"".

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.


 
Thanks!

As you know, the Corporate Responsibility group has commissioned a survey of Enron's stakeholders to gauge their opinions on corporate social responsibility and how they perceive Enron in that regard (along with comparison companies so it will not be obvious that it is Enron that has commissioned the survey.)  Lists of stakeholders to be surveyed have been compiled with the help of various corporate and business unit staff to get to a sample of 100 (50 companies,  25 government/regulators, 10 non-governmental organizations, and 15 from media, finance and academia).

The survey questionnaire is attached below.  It was written for the company respondents, with some adjustments for government, NGO and others in bold pink font.  Kelly suggested that the questionnaire would benefit from your review.  Please provide me your comments, or any questions, by Monday, September 24.

	The Government Affairs group is involved in diverse and complex activities.  Tracking and quantifying these activities is important for several obvious reasons - to keep upper management apprised of our activities; to illustrate the value added and risk managed by our group; and to keep each other properly  informed so that we can better coordinate our efforts.

	Currently, these activities take place on an ad-hoc manual basis, which is time-consuming and inefficient.  We have a tool already in place to track our activities - the Project Tracking database in Lotus Notes.  Currently this application is used primarily for RCR's, but beginning November 1, 2001, the Government Affairs group will use this application to track all projects and efforts  - replacing the need for manual updated spreadsheets and activity quantification ""fire-drills"".  The Projects have several features to allow capture of sub-sets of information, including Updates, Risk, Origination and Valuation.

	**  Please note that this will become the only way that we'll gather this information.  In other words, if you don't enter your data into Project Tracking, we won't know what you're doing! **( all other reports will be eliminated)

	The current Lotus Notes application will be discontinued as of October 31,2001 and will be converted to a web-based product.  You'll find the web-based version as easy or even easier to use than Lotus Notes.  Additionally, conversion to a new database structure will allow for more versatile report extraction.

	Before the conversion of the project data from Lotus Notes to Oracle, we need to do some data cleanup.

Calif. seen facing next power crunch in May 2002
 

LOS ANGELES, Oct 15 (Reuters) - California looks to have sufficient power supplies to get through the winter without blackouts, with its next supply challenge likely to occur next May, according to a report issued by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) on Monday. 

""Based on currently available data with the possible exception of May 2002, the CAISO anticipates sufficient capacity margins throughout the winter season..,"" the agency, which controls most of the state's power grid, said in its winter assessment report. 

The report, which covered October 2001 through May 2002, projected that resources would cover expected load each month with the exception of May, when demand rises significantly as the region starts to heat up. 

""Operating margins for May 2002 are slim with the current level of planned outages. However, the May peak generally occurs late in the month and planned outage levels usually decline significantly throughout the month,"" the report noted. 

The report also said that new generation should play a key role in helping to avert blackouts in May. 

""It is expected that sufficient new generation will become available such that the projected deficiency for May 2002 can be avoided,"" the report said. 

An additional 1,612 megawatts is expected to be operational by the end of 2001. During 2002, an additional 6,490 MW of new generation capacity is expected to be added based on currently announced plans. 

""This additional generation is in varying phases of development and it is uncertain how much of this new capacity will become available during the January through May 2002 period,"" the report said. 

Forecast peak load was seen mostly running slightly below an average covering 1998-2001. In December, for example, a peak load of 33,586 MW was projected versus an average of 33,937 MW, ISO figures show. 

Demand has been running below year earlier levels each month this year. 

""The CAISO foresees that there will be some lasting effects due to conservation efforts, but anticipates that the magnitude of conservation may decrease over time,"" the report said. 

California, hit with a severe power shortage linked partly to a flawed law deregulating its electricity market, endured the year's sixth and so far last rolling blackout on May 8. 

The lights stayed on throughout the summer, when the threat of blackouts was seen to be greatest due to heavy use of power hungry air conditioning systems. 

Conservation and new power plants are believed to have played important roles in preventing blackouts.

 
 
Texas Ready For Jan 1 Start For Deregulation -Official
  
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Texas will be ready to implement full-scale deregulation of the retail electricity business at the beginning of next year, despite challenges from critics, the top official at the state's power-grid operator said Monday . 

""We believe that we've come a long way,"" said Tom Noel, chief executive officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. ""My confidence is very high that the Ercot system will be ready to go Jan. 1, 2002."" 

A coalition of Texas consumer groups filed with the state's Public Utility Commission last week to urge a delay. A pilot program for 5% of Texas' investor-owned utility customers has been in effect since late July, and it started after a nearly two-month delay linked to system glitches. 

The consumer groups, including AARP and Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports, want to delay the start of full competition until Ercot proves its systems are up to the task. The groups cited problems with switching customers from their utility to alternate suppliers, among other issues. 

""It is in the best interests of consumers and the industry to be sure that when the market is open it is also functional,"" the groups said in comments filed with the PSC. 

But Noel said most glitches have been fixed or will be fixed in time to meet the Jan. 1 deadline. So far 11,952 of 78,825 customers that requested a switch to a new provider have been switched, and the others are moving through the planned 45-day switching process, he said. There was a backlog of customers waiting to switch in August, caused by system malfunctions, but those have mostly been resolved, he said. 

Ercot has had other trouble making sure its system gets customer information to the new power supplier, but it believes those systems will be fixed by mid November, Noel said. 

Noel also said Ercot's settlement system will become more accurate over time as more data is collected to provide better cost estimates. The settlement system calculates costs for large and small wholesale power customers and has been a source of dispute in the state. 

""The market's working very well,"" Noel said. ""What we have is a data problem."" 

Ercot's systems are designed to handle about 20,000 customer switches a day. So far, the system has received and processed a peak volume of between 10,000 and 15,000 switches, Noel said.

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday its third-quarter earnings rose as its core wholesale marketing and trading division delivered strong returns. 
The company said earnings rose to $393 million, or 43 cents per share, from $292 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. The company reported a share loss of 84 cents after $1.01 billion of nonrecurring charges.
""After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energybusinesses,"" said Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman and chif executive officer. 
Enron's non-recurring charges included $287 million related to the write-down of its troubled water venture, Azurix, as well as $544 million writedown related to various investments including its retail electricity provider New Power Co. and $180 million related to restructuring of its broadband operations. 
Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected earnings of 42 cents to 45 cents per share, with a mean estimate of 43 cents. 
The results met expectations for a rocky quarter that included the surprise departure of President and Chief Executive Jeff Skilling in August, after just six months at the helm. 
Enron shares closed on Monday at $33.17, down $2.64 or 7.3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year, the stock has fallen some 60 percent, far worse than the 25 percent loss of the Standard & Poor's utilities index .

Enron Has Loss of 84 Cents a Share in Third Quarter (Update2)

     (Adds profit excluding charges in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, said it had a third-quarter loss after taking
$1.01 billion in charges for restructuring, investment losses, and
the planned sale of a water business.

     The loss was $618 million, or 84 cents a share after
preferred-dividend payments, Houston-based Enron said in a
statement. A year earlier, Enron had net income of $292 million,
or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion from
$30 billion.

     The charges totaled $1.11 a share. They included $287 million
for asset impairments by water company Azurix Corp., $180 million
to restructure the company's unit that trades fiber-optic
bandwidth and $544 million for losses on investments including New
Power Co., a retail energy-sales venture.

     Excluding the charges, Enron said it would have earned
$393 million, or 43 cents a share. That matched the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.

     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp is expected to report later today third-quarter earnings per share of 43 cents, compared with 34 cents a year earlier, according to the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of 17 brokers. 
The integrated energy company is expected to meet near-consensus results driven by its wholesale services division, analysts said.
Montgomery Securities analyst Daniel Tulis is calculating third-quarter EPS of 42 cents, 1 cent below consensus. 
Full-year EPS stands at 1.85. 
Enron's third quarter was marked by the unexpected departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling, for personal reasons, with Chairman Ken Lay reassuming the key position. 
Lay is likely to remain in the position until it is filled within 12-18 months, Tulis said. 
The company remains embroiled in arbitration proceedings in India after its 2.9 bln usd Dabhol power plant in India was closed. The plant's sole client, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), failed - and later refused - to pay bills that now total about 45 mln usd.

Reliant Hires Merrill to Find Buyer for Dutch Power Producer

Reliant Hires Merrill to Find Buyer for Dutch Power Producer

     Amsterdam, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Reliant Energy Inc., the
owner of Houston's utility, said it hired Merrill Lynch & Co. to
find a buyer for its Dutch power-generation business, two years
after acquiring the company from the government for $2.3 billion.

     Reliant has already been approached by possible buyers, said
Clyde Moerlie, a spokesman for Reliant Energy Europe. The unit,
which doesn't have any household customers, earned $9 million in
the second quarter compared with $26 million a year earlier.

     The U.S. company may struggle to get the price it paid for
the Utrecht-based unit, formerly known as UNA, analysts said, on
expectations heightened competition will erode profit further and
as utilities increasingly seek customers as well as power plants.

     In the Dutch generation market, ``there aren't many
opportunities, but prices will fall to much lower levels as
growing competition pushes down tariffs,'' said Steven de Proost,
an analyst at Delta Lloyd Securities in Antwerp.

     Houston-based Reliant paid 2.9 times sales for UNA in 1999,
while Electrabel SA, Belgium's dominant power provider, paid 2.7
times sales for Epon, the biggest utility in the Netherlands. E.ON
AG of Germany paid 1.6 times sales the same year for the generator
NV Electriciteitsbedrijf Zuid-Holland, or EZH.

     Reliant joins rivals TXU Corp. and Edison International in
reassessing its European business amid disappointing earnings.
Reliant in July tied the second-quarter profit drop in Europe to
increased competition and falling margins in the Dutch market.

                            Enron Cuts

     Enron Corp. said last week it will cut 10 percent of its
European workforce, while Edison Mission Energy agreed to sell two
U.K. power plants to American Electric Power Co. on Monday.

     The U.S. utility said last month it was considering a sale of
the Dutch business after it was contacted ``by a number of parties
who have expressed an interest'' in its European assets, and as it
reallocates capital to fulfill ``growth objectives.''

     Merrill already advised the Dutch state on the original sale
of UNA to Reliant, the only time a U.S. company has taken control
of a continental European utility. This year, Merrill ranks sixth
in advising on transactions involving a European utilities target,
with $6.9 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions.

     Potential buyers for UNA, which provides about 20 percent of
the Netherlands' electricity, are likely to be companies already
present in the Dutch market, such as Nuon NV, Eneco, or Spain's
Endesa SA, analysts said. UNA may also attract generation
companies including Mirant Corp. and International Power Plc.

     Atlanta-based Mirant and International Power predecessor
National Power Plc both bid for UNA when it was first put up for
sale. Central and Northern Europe are ``areas we're interested
in,'' said Aarti Singhal, an International Power spokeswoman.

     ``We're looking at all options,'' said Fransce Verdeuzeldonk,
a spokeswoman for Nuon, in an interview.

                         Spanish Interest

     Endesa, Spain's largest power producer, agreed to buy Remu
NV, the No. 4 electric utility in the Netherlands, for 1.5 billion
euros last December. The completion of the transaction has been
held up by the Dutch government, which wants at least 51 percent
of utility company shares to remain in the hands of public
authorities until at least 2004.

     An Endesa spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the
company would be interested in UNA. Endesa said in July its
purchase of an Italian generator was enough to meet its goal of
having 8,000 megawatts of capacity in Europe outside Spain.

     Based in Utrecht in central Netherlands, UNA is one of the
four main power generation companies in Holland, operating six
power plants. It had 1998 sales of about $800 million and is one
of the only generation companies in the market up for grabs.

     Germany's E.ON owns EZH, Belgium's Electrabel controls Epon,
while EPZ, another big power producer, is owned by Essent NV.




India: IDBI signals SOS for Rs 3,000-cr equity

10/16/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd

NEW DELHI, Oct. 15. INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India (IDBI), the country's largest development financial institution, appears to be heading for some serious trouble. 
A revised set of figures placed by the institution to the Ministry of Finance has indicated a cash requirement of Rs 7,000 crore over the next three years, much of which it is finding difficult to tie up. Besides, it has also placed a request for a Rs 3,000-crore equity infusion from the Government.
The revised financial projections were placed before the Finance Ministry last week by an IDBI team headed by the Chairman, Mr P.P. Vora. The meeting was attended by the Advisor, Ministry of Finance, Dr Rakesh Mohan, the Additional Secretary, Capital Markets Division, Mr S.K. 
Purakayastha, and the Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Mr G.P. Muniappan. 
At a meeting on October 5, IDBI had placed its capital infusion requirement at Rs 2,500 crore and immediate fund requirement at about Rs 5,500 crore. 
Officials have been particularly concerned over IDBI's admission that it has been struggling to raise resources from the market due to the rating downgrade in August despite its massive requirements. It has also admitted to the Ministry that it may be heading for losses during the current fiscal. According to sources, the institution has admitted that the losses could spill over to the subsequent year unless assistance comes at an appropriate time. 
IDBI has said the capital infusion of Rs 3,000 crore is being sought to write off a portion of the institution's huge portfolio of non-performing assets (NPAs), which at the end of fiscal 2000-01 stood at over Rs 9,000 crore in gross terms. 
The institution has argued that only a massive NPA write-off would enable it to get back its rating, thereby allowing it to tie up the funds requirement from the market. IDBI's rating was downgraded by Crisil from AAA to AA+ recently. 
IDBI, which was directed by the Government to submit a three-year cash flow statement during the October 5 meeting, has said the additional cash requirement for the three years alone stands at Rs 7,000 crore. 
Of the cash requirement, the immediate need includes a Rs 2,200-crore repayment arising out of the institution's decision to exercise the call option on its earlier bonds series. The repayment would be due in March 2002. 
Moreover, the institution also wants to keep itself ready in the event that Enron, the promoters of Dabhol Power Company, invokes its guarantee of about Rs 1,800 crore.

BOMBAY, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Tata Power Company, India's largest private utility, on Tuesday reported net profit for the July-September quarter rose 74 percent over a year earlier, far above analysts' expectations. 
The company, which is negotiating to buy Enron Corp's stake in a troubled Indian unit, said net profit rose to 2.42 billion rupees ($50.42 million) from 1.39 billion a year earlier on sales that rose 17.54 percent to 10.99 billion rupees.
The performance was boosted by a profit of 660 million rupees from sale of long term investments in the quarter, against 210 million a year earlier. 
A Reuters poll of 14 brokerages released last week forecast net profit for the quarter would drop to a median 1.27 billion rupees from a year earlier, on an 8.45 percent rise in sales to 10.11 billion rupees. 
Tata Power generates thermal and hydro-electric power, and distributes electricity across the western state of Maharashtra, including its capital Bombay. 
Ahead of the results, its shares closed down 0.62 percent at 96.65 rupees while the Bombay benchmark index ended 0.54 percent higher. (US$1=47.99 Indian rupees).

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Enron said on Thursday it will shut its European broadband telecommunications business in London within the next six months and move the operations to its headquarters in Houston, Texas. 
""Poor demand for broadband services is being exacerbated by falling prices, requiring Enron to consider the best options for managing its global broadband business,"" a spokesman told Reuters.
Enron recently scaled back its European broadband operations ahead of this latest consolidation, he added. 
The spokesman was unable to say how many people were employed in the business in London. 
Enron's CEO Kenneth Lay said earlier this month the company was reviewing options for the loss-making broadband operations which could include selling it or finding a partner. 
The broadband unit, which owns an 18,000 mile network, posted a loss of $800 million in the third quarter of the year. 
Enron launched its broadband business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but has recently admitted it overestimated the market's early potential. 
Problems with the broadband unit were one reason behind the sharp drop in the company's shares this year. 
The fall accelerated in recent days after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced an investigation into off-the-balance sheet deals with former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
On Wednesday, the company announced Fastow had taken leave of absence and would be replaced by Jeff McMahon.

FERC extends $1,000 price cap on NY ISO power
 
WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday agreed to extend a price cap of $1,000 per megawatt hour for wholesale electricity bids handled by the New York Independent System Operator. 

The New York ISO asked FERC to approve an extension through April 30, 2002, for the price cap, which first went into effect in July of last year. 

However, FERC said it expected power supplies in New York City and Long Island to remain tight through the summer of 2002. The ISO would likely request another bid cap extension at that time. 

Therefore, FERC said the price cap will last as an interim measure until the new Northeast Regional Transmission Organization is up and running. 

""We believe that our decision ... will promote price certainty and market participants' confidence in the New York ISO-administered markets, which will increase supply, improve reliability and ... lower energy prices,"" the agency said in its order. 

The New York ISO operates one of the nation's biggest wholesale electric markets with billions of dollars in transactions. 

The $1,000 price cap was first adopted to control market manipulation and prevent artificially inflated prices. The cap is supported by several large utilities, such as Consolidated Edison Inc. , which were concerned about high wholesale power prices that occurred after the New York ISO took control of the state's power grid. 

FERC aims to create four huge Regional Transmission Organizations to replace the New York ISO and similar groups in managing the nation's power grid. Federal regulators see the RTOs as a way to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter, in which the antiquated U.S. grid prevented more power from flowing into the state. 

Under FERC's plan, the RTOs would be for-profit groups in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access, more reliable power and lower rates for consumers. 

However, some utilities have been hesitant to join an RTO because they will some lose control over the rates they charge other companies to use their power lines. 


Creating chaos out of order ; Power play: Federal order to merge electric transmission grids will hurt Maryland consumers.


USING scare and bully tactics, the federal government is trying to force Maryland electricity consumers into paying higher prices for less reliable service and less local control. 

That's the outlook for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's plan to create four new large regional power transmission groups to manage the nation's electric grid. The efficient, stable, economical PJM Interconnection grid system that's taken over 70 years to refine would be twisted and subverted to serve the needs of high-cost New York. 

Maryland's carefully crafted deregulation plan to benefit consumers and utilities is also threatened by the FERC order to create a Northeast regional transmission organization within three years. 

Challenges by Maryland, Virginia and Washington to the federal agency's mandate have been ignored. So have protests from Vermont and New Hampshire. 

Curiously, FERC cited the PJM network, which includes Maryland, as a model for the nation. Then it ordered a hasty merger of PJM with less able New York and New England systems. 

Warning of California -type energy problems for the rest of the nation, FERC has pressed its theory that bigger is always better. It ignores the fact that California is the largest U.S. electric market and still failed due to arrogant mismanagement. 

Some opposition to the FERC plan is based on loss of control by state regulators and existing regional systems. States opposed to deregulation fear the plan will force that change on them. 

Even within PJM, which serves five states and Washington, members hold differing positions on forming mega-regional networks. 

But PJM is the largest competitive wholesale power market in the world and has served its 22 million customers well. There's little benefit and a lot of risk in forcing it into a shotgun marriage with less capable Northeastern partners.

 
Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter
 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. 

The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. 

In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. 

Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. 

The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. 

According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. 

The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. 

Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. 

The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. 

The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders. 
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. 
During the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. 
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while ""we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well."" Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. 
Mr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was ""very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about."" He added ""we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy."" 
Internal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. 
During the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. ""There's the appearance you are hiding something,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. ""You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board."" 
Mr. Lay responded, ""We're trying to be as transparent as we can.""

Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts
By FLOYD NORRIS

c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities. 
In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.
But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. 
The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. 
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. 
After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' 
Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' 
Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. 
Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. 
Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' 
Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. 
Mr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. 
The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. 
After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.

Surge in Optimism Prompts Straddles In Enron and Cisco
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Bullish calls traded heavily early as investors, encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares, bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies. 
At one point, the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange fell to 0.28, compared with 0.68 Friday and Monday's three-month closing low of 0.42.
The surge of optimism -- also evident in the CBOE market-volatility index, or VIX -- prompted traders to begin covering the downside, just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat. Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. 
Buyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. 
The implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. 
The volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. 
To be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.

Company's credibility questioned

Enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chief financial officer ran two investment partnerships that did business with Enron, the company's chief executive officer said Tuesday. 
The Houston-based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's former role with two partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron. 
Enron disclosed Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an ""informal inquiry"" into transactions between Enron and the two partnerships. 
It declined to say if the SEC is looking into other transactions. 
After the disclosure, Enron's stock fell almost 21 percent Monday. Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. 
The news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. 
Tuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. 
It remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. 
""I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions,"" he said. 
Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. 
He did say Enron was aware an ""inherent conflict of interest"" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. 
In response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. 
""There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron,"" he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. 
Lay and Enron's board continue to have the ""highest faith and confidence"" in Fastow, he added. 
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. 
Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. 
It took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. 
During the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. 
They stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. 
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. 
""I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call,"" he said.

Busy signal 
Enron should know plenty about bandwidth.
Through Enron Broadband Services, the giant energy company boasts about ""developing an open and efficient market for bandwidth that provides liquidity, reliability, price transparency and guaranteed service levels"". 
But there were no guarantees about service levels yesterday, when Enron held a conference call to ""address investor concerns"" about its financial dealings. 
Despite the bandwidth expertise, the call - the first time that Andrew Fastow, chief financial officer, has faced questions about the transactions from analysts - was available to just 300 lucky telephone diallers. A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. 
Those investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on.

USA: Enron mulls ways to cover portfolio shortfalls-WSJ.

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. 
Enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.
The report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, the report said. 
According to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report said. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward repaying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron. 
Glisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" 
According to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. 
Enron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor concerns after U.S. regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than $10 billion in value over the past week. 
Enron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in cash flow, depending on commodity prices and market hedges.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

10/24/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron (ENE) shares, diluting the position of current shareholders.
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months. 
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share.

Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750-million loan, ensuring access to credit if the beleaguered company is cut off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter. 
Enron's shares and bonds plunged after the firm said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its finances.
The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75% this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends on a $3-billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations. 
As a second-tier commercial paper borrower, any ratings drop may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market and raise costs of short-term debt. 
Enron shares dropped 86 cents to close at $19.79 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars over the next 18 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, treasurer Ben Glisan said. The possible shortfall related to about $3.2-billion (U.S.) in notes that related entities sold to investors since 1999, he said. Proceeds from those notes were invested in various Enron assets. Mr. Glisan said those notes come due over the next 18 months and Enron still hopes to sell enough assets to fully repay the notes. However, making up any shortfall with funds raised by selling stock has become more expensive as Enron's share price has plunged. Over the past week, shares of the energy trading giant have fallen more than 40 per cent.

Abreast of the Market
Everest Re, St. Paul and Providian Drop, but Markets Stay Resilient
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

10/24/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements. 
Shares of drug maker Pharmacia fell $4.37, or 13%, to $38.39, after the company issued third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, but also issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed.
In fact, several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. 
Shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. 
Power utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. 
Nevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. 
""Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market,"" Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. ""Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it."" 
Some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. 
Whatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. 
Investors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. 
Consumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. 
There were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. 
Vitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. 
NetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Chartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. 
Shares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. 
EarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. 
AT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Several steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31. 
McKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug distributor and health-care information technology provider posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. 
Watson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its rating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings projections for the company. 
Furniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating on the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers.

NEW DELHI -- Following Enron Corp. U.S. energy company AES Corp. has turned to the Indian prime minister for help in settling its grievances with a state government. 
In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India is being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.
A copy of the letter, dated Oct. 1, was made available to the Associated Press. 
AES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. 
AES and Enron are the only major American power companies to make big investments in India since the government allowed foreign investment in the sector in the early 1990s. 
In his letter, Mr. Bakke drew Mr. Vajpayee's attention to the ""expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation . . . and direct interference with day-to-day management"" by the state government and its agencies.

UK: LNG delays could spawn shipping crisis - analysts.
By Pete Harrison

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The transport chain supporting the global LNG industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines, shipping analysts warn. 
More LNG tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the Far East, many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand, which might emerge later than scheduled.
""The issue is timing,"" Jarle Sjo, shipping equity analyst at Oslo-based investment bank First Securities told Reuters. 
""Historically, LNG projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about six months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term,"" he added. 
The world fleet of LNG tankers currently numbers 123, but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004, according to shipping database Fairplay. 
Gas industry analysts expect some LNG projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn, excess capacity at existing plants in Asia and a sharp fall in U.S. natural gas prices this year. 
Svein Erik Amundsen, Managing Director of Norwegian shipping group Bergesen, said that a sustained economic downturn could have ""consequences."" 
""I wouldn't be surprised by project delays,"" he told Reuters. ""This could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment."" 
""I think you can say we're still optimistic, but more cautiously optimistic than before,"" he added. Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. 
STOP AND THINK 
The world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. 
Golar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. 
""There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered,"" Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, ""The only risk is things might be delayed."" 
Stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. 
Golar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. 
""We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender,"" Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. 
He said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. 
""It's a good time to wait,"" said Saverys.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- British Gas has offered India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) equity in its exploration acreage in Brazil and a cash settlement in lieu of operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields, the Economic Times reported Wednesday. 
ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) are claiming operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields following Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd.'s 30% stake sale to BG, according to the report.
State-owned ONGC holds a 40% stake in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields and Reliance owns 30%. 
The Enron Oil & Gas stake sale will fall through if BG isn't given the operatorship of the oil fields, Nigel Shaw, vice president of BG India said in the report. 
Shaw said the equity partners are in discussions on the issue of operatorship, the report said. 
British Gas is a unit of BG Group PLC (BRG). Enron Oil & Gas is a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE).

Private Investors Align to Upgrade California's Path 15;=20
Project Causes New State / Federal Conflicts=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] The federal government has reached a deal with a c=
oalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central Califo=
rnia under a $300-million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving=
 electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state.=
 Construction on the so-called Path 15 project, which was announced by Ener=
gy Secretary Spencer Abraham, will begin in the spring of 2003 and could be=
 completed by as early as summer 2004.=20

Analysis: The California energy crisis, which clearly subsided over the sum=
mer of 2001 due to new generation that came online in the state, mild weath=
er patterns and conservation efforts, is generally considered the result of=
 a severe supply / demand imbalance. While this may be true, what often get=
s overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the state-the lines=
 that actually transport power from point A to point B-also played a primar=
y role in creating the tremendous instability of California's energy market=
. This problem still persists today, and as California heads into the winte=
r season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing. The Dep=
artment of Energy (DOE) has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing=
 a massive upgrade to California's main transmission line. While this is a =
positive step, the upgrade creates a new level of state / federal disputes =
for California and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into th=
e hands of private companies, which creates a whole new set of potential co=
nflicts.=20

Amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the Path 15 upgrade, there a=
re some things that we know for sure. First, Path 15, which is owned by Pac=
ific Gas & Electric Co., is a 90-mile high-voltage section of transmission =
capacity that essentially carries power between Northern and Southern Calif=
ornia. During the peak of the energy crisis in California, Path 15 became r=
ather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks (points at which transmission c=
ould not transport high volumes of power). This pre-empted any transport of=
 power from Southern California (and Arizona and Mexico) to the north, whic=
h resulted in rolling blackouts in San Francisco and other Northern Califor=
nia cities. As noted, these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly=
 acute during times of peak power demand, which is obviously a concern as w=
inter approaches.=20

The deficiency of the California transmission systems is arguably the last =
piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the stat=
e's energy market. Ironically, power supply is no longer seen as an imminen=
t problem. New reports from the California ISO indicate that the state shou=
ld have operating reserves of between 2,000 and 2,200 MW this winter, which=
 has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous=
 winter season. However, the report on the state's transmission system is n=
ot as positive. If the Northwest continues to experience a drought, then No=
rthern California will still need to import more power from the south. Heav=
y dependence on the strained Path 15 could once again cause reliability pro=
blems for California.=20

Thus, deficiencies along Path 15 can be seen as a symptom of larger problem=
s that continue to plague California, and problems that have been the focus=
 of both state and federal intervention for months, if not years. In fact, =
there is a history here that is worth noting, especially as it relates to f=
ederal / state jurisdiction. When President Bush released his national ener=
gy plan in April of this year, he directed the DOE to explore efforts that =
would relieve congestion along Path 15. Following through with this order, =
Energy Secretary Abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited respo=
nses from 13 companies interested in participating in the expansion of Path=
 15. The current contract, which will add a new line to the existing Path 1=
5, is the result of that previous directive.=20

At present, it appears that PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG), the parent of Pacific G=
as & Electric Co., and six other companies have signed on to financially su=
pport the upgrade. The six other companies that will spearhead the project =
are the Transmission Agency of Northern California, Trans-Elect, Inc., Kind=
er Morgan Power Co., PG&E National Energy Group, Williams Energy Marketing =
and Trading, and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), a federal ag=
ency within the DOE that sells electricity from water projects in 15 wester=
n states and operates 17,000 miles of transmission lines.=20

Presently, Path 15 connects the Bay Area in Northern California to two of t=
he state's largest generation facilities-Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s Diabl=
o Canyon nuclear facility and Duke Energy's Morro Bay natural-gas power pla=
nt. The upgrade will reportedly include a new 500-kilovolt line that would =
boost transmission by about 1,500 MW from these two plants. Further, when t=
he upgrade is finished in 2004, Path 15 should be able to carry a total of =
5,400 MW of power.=20

Of course, the first question that I asked was: Who is going to pay for the=
 upgrade? The way it appears at this writing is that the WAPA will retain 1=
0-percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for=
 acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line. The rema=
ining 90 percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting d=
ifferent amounts of capital to fund the upgrade. The exact percentages of i=
nvestment (and ownership) have yet to be defined, but should be revealed in=
 a subsequent plan outlined in the next 90 days. You may ask why these comp=
anies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in California. Th=
e answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments thr=
ough fees charged to use the new transmission line. This could result in a =
hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project, who presumably ant=
icipate that California will remain a high-demand state through which huge =
amounts of power will need to be transported.=20

As I mentioned, there are some potential conflicts that might arise with th=
is upgrade plan. First, there is the issue of potential state / federal reg=
ulatory conflicts. Presently, state governments have jurisdiction over powe=
r line siting. Thus, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) had =
already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for Path 15 prior to Secretary A=
braham's call for private-company bids. Specifically, the CPUC had directed=
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which it regulates, to upgrade the bottleneck =
spots along Path 15. As seems to be a growing occurrence, we may find that =
there is a state / federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulator=
y body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in Cali=
fornia. Gov. Gray Davis and the CPUC certainly seem to believe that it is t=
he state's prerogative, and have issued strong criticisms over the DOE's ve=
nture into this territory. However, in his energy plan, President Bush seem=
ed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obta=
in transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission ca=
pacity. If there is indeed a dispute between the CPUC and the DOE, it is no=
t known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area. In any=
 event, representatives from Trans-Elect, one of the participating companie=
s, have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state (=
and public and private) interests will be one of the key challenges for the=
 upgrade project. Note that Trans-Elect was the company that had unsuccessf=
ully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of Southern California E=
dison earlier this year.=20

Also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the DOE's upgrade plan for=
 Path 15 are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a =
major piece of California's transmission grid. The DOE-sponsored upgrade, u=
nlike the one that the CPUC has directed, reportedly would not be subject t=
o review or approval by either the California ISO or the CPUC. Further, bec=
ause the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the n=
ew line, these companies will be able to charge ""tolls"" to the power market=
ers that use the lines to transport power. This is most likely a point of c=
ontention for California officials, especially Gov. Gray Davis, who has sou=
ght state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on p=
rivate-company ownership of generation facilities in the state. The positiv=
e side of this issue is that, according to the DOE, the bids from private c=
ontracts enable the upgrade of Path 15 to proceed without any increase to ""=
either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of Am=
erica.""=20

As a side note, in addition to Path 15 the CPUC is also proceeding with a n=
ew transmission line in Southern California, known as the Valley-Rainbow In=
terconnect transmission line. Although the timetable has been delayed until=
 2005, San Diego Gas & Electric is proceeding with a 500,000-volt transmiss=
ion line that would connect Southern California Edison's Valley Substation =
near Romoland, Calif., with a future substation to be located in the Rainbo=
w, Calif. area, just south of the Riverside-San Diego county line. The new =
transmission line would provide a second interconnection between SDG&E's an=
d SCE's transmission systems. The first interconnection is at the San Onofr=
e Substation near San Clemente, Calif. The project is designed to deliver a=
pproximately 1,000 MW.=20

Moreover, the expansion of Path 15 is a necessary step to help California l=
ower its risk for further reliability problems. Due to generation developme=
nt, the imminent threat of the California energy crisis has diminished, but=
 the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors=
. The state government still has its hand in power purchases, which represe=
nts a huge part of the state's energy market. The state has accrued $12.5 b=
illion in debt to buy power for the state's utilities, the recovery for whi=
ch remains an unresolved issue. While Gov. Davis has preferred to increase =
the state's role in California's energy infrastructure, this new DOE-sponso=
red project on Path 15 puts ownership of transmission assets into the hands=
 of private companies.=20

Nuclear Experts Respond to Yucca Mountain IssueAlert 


By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President

Brian O'Connell, P.E., Director of Nuclear Waste Program Office for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and Janet Schlueter, Chief of Staff and Nuclear Materials Assistant for Commissioner Edward McGaffigan of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), sent us several clarifying points concerning Yucca Mountain and nuclear waste, which we believe should be shared with our readership. 

The action taken by the NRC on October 23 was not an ""approval"" of the Yucca Mountain site. What the NRC approved was the ""site suitability guidelines""-the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Part 963 general repository siting guidelines that the DOE will use to evaluate Yucca Mountain when it submits a recommendation to the President on whether the site is ""suitable"" for the repository purpose. Then, after the unusual approval procedures of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), the next step would be to submit a license application to the NRC to build the repository. The Commission's concurrence on DOE's general repository siting rule is separate and distinct from any comments NRC may have on DOE's preliminary site suitability recommendation. 

According to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), 2,000 metric tons are generated by the nuclear industry per year, not 30,000 tons per year as we reported. The entire industry has produced about 40,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel over the past four decades. 

Finally, the federal government may not be able to avoid responsibility for the actual transport of nuclear materials to Yucca Mountain. Section 137(a)(2) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act does call for the DOE to ""utilize by contract private industry to the fullest extent possible."" Regardless of whether the shipments are made by the government or contractors, all shipments must meet NRC and other federal and state regulatory requirements.

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch-NY-October 25, 2001: Fitch places the following Enron
securities on Rating Watch Negative: senior unsecured debt
`BBB+'; subordinated debt `BBB'; preferred stock `BBB-`;
and commercial paper `F2'. Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated
senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and
Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch
Negative.

The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital
market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The
loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it
continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and
access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability
to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced
a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in
the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet
equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of
structured transactions. Since that time, there have been
several damaging news reports on the company and its
management. More importantly, investors have voiced
concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and
spreads on its debt have widened.

The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly
stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its
business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is
available under committed bank lines.

An additional concern is that certain structured
transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II
and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment
exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying
assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is
derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily
convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to
repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120
days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger
event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred
stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the
senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on
its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a
payment obligation of Enron, representing a general
unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade
of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by
one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with
specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over
three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a
forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was
being made to register the shares. The total amount of
Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron
has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch
has no information to indicate that there are any
fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail,
and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact
with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor
ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.


STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. 
At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.
Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. 
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to ""buy- speculative,"" from ""buy-high risk"", to reflect his concerns that ""lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations."" 
""This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked,"" he said.

2001-10-25 14:13 (New York)

   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit
quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in
policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the
companies said Thursday. 

  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of
the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall
by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial
structure. 

  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this
week. 

  ""We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,"" said John
Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). ""It's business as usual."" 

  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made
no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and
gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. 

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.

  ""Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"" said
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 

  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't
expect to make any drastic changes. 
 


Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues
By Andrew Dowell
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. 
The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.
The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. 
""It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO,"" Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. 
Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. 
Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. 
The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. 
As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. 
Willing To Renegotiate 

Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. 
California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. 
Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. 
""We're always willing to sit down with a customer,"" Malcolm said. 
Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. 
Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. 
""To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away,"" he said. 
Downplaying Enron Opportunities 

Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. 
Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. 
""That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing,"" Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. 
Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. 
Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. 
""We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers,"" Malcolm said. 
TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.' Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co.

              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that

              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but
              I still think that--

              Kernen:  It's no longer the--

              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety
              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.

Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

State loses $25 million in power plays, ploys 
It sold some energy for loss, gave some away
 
Sacramento -- California sold electricity on a day it endured rolling blackouts and gave it away for free on another day earlier this year, according to documents that detail at least $25 million in power trading losses. 

The state Department of Water Resources, which has stepped in as the power buyer for troubled utilities, said yesterday that it sold 224,871 megawatt hours of electricity during the three-month period ending in June. That represents about 1 percent of the total traded during that period. 

Included were some sales for next to nothing -- or nothing at all. 

On May 26, the state sold 500 megawatt hours of power for 50 cents apiece to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The state paid an average of $271 a megawatt hour during May. 

Two days later, the state gave away 786 megawatt hours of power to a British Columbia utility. 

""We may not have had a buyer,"" said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the Department of Water Resources. ""It's not a storable product."" 

Giving the electricity away may have actually saved the state money, he said, because power grid rules can require buyers to pay a generator not to produce power if the system doesn't need it. 

Other Department of Water Resources records show that the state also sold power March 19, when 1.2 million customers statewide lost electricity in rolling blackouts for about 90 minutes. 

Officials said the fact that the state had to sell power that day was a reflection of how chaotic and fast-changing the electricity supply-and-demand situation was during the height of the energy crisis. 

State officials say it is normal for any energy-buying operation to have a surplus of electricity occasionally. Turning into a seller from time to time, they say, has helped the state to drive down prices and steadily lower monthly power-buying costs. 

But critics say the size of the losses is proof that the state locked in too much power at above-market rates in its early forays into the electricity- buying business. 

""I suspect that these (losses) are continuing and that they are continuing because (the Department of Water Resources) bought more power than we needed during the cool summer,"" said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine. 


 
Vote for public power no guarantee it will happen 
Two propositions on S.F. ballot
 
If San Francisco voters decide Nov. 6 that a public agency is a better bet to provide cheaper, more reliable power than PG&E, it will be some time before the switch is flipped. 

Propositions F and I, which only set up the first steps toward public control, also face possible legal challenges from Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and other large utilities that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars campaigning against the measures. 

There is also uncertainty about the costs. Neither measure has a price tag attached. 

For more than two decades in San Francisco, PG&E has lobbied City Hall vigorously and used legal maneuvers to keep public power off the ballot. But the company was thwarted in the past year by a voter-backed initiative drive and a Board of Supervisors that advocates local control over the electrical system. The move gained steam with the state energy crisis. 

If San Francisco voters take the initial steps toward public power on Nov. 6, they will join more than 2,000 public jurisdictions, including Sacramento, Los Angeles and Seattle, that provide electric power to about 40 million customers, accounting for 15 percent of the demand in the United States. 

Proposition I would establish a municipal utility district, or MUD, in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane that would be governed by an elected five- member board of directors. Measure-backers included Brisbane to meet a state requirement that more than one jurisdiction in a municipal utility district. 

The directors after conducting a feasibility study, could decide to provide electricity directly to residents and businesses. 

They then could use eminent domain to take over the electrical generation and distribution lines from PG&E and the San Francisco-owned Hetch Hetchy Water and Power agency. 

The other measure, Proposition F, would set up a Water and Power Agency for San Francisco only. The agency would be governed by an elected seven-member board of directors and would replace the mayor-appointed Public Utilities Commission. The PUC currently provides electricity to municipal operations and water and sewer service to homes and businesses. 

Like the MUD called for in Proposition I, the agency would have to conduct a feasibility study to review the costs and benefits of public power. 

Then, with the consent of the Board of Supervisors, the agency could take over PG&E's electricity system. No such board consent would be needed under Proposition I. The agency also would have the ability to issue revenue bonds under $100 million without approval by supervisors or voters. Anything over that amount would be subject to a referendum. 

The Prop. F plan is also designed to promote conservation efforts and renewable energy. 

Props. F and I both rely on elected directors, who ultimately will decide whether to create a public power system. 

The board would also set the rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity to whether to use more renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydroelectric and solar power. 

If both measures pass, Prop. I will take priority. Supervisors placed Prop. F on the ballot as a backup -- one they believe could better withstand the expected legal challenges from PG&E. 

The utility waged a 23-year battle to beat back public power in Sacramento - - and eventually lost. 

Opponents of the S.F. public power effort, with PG&E at the lead, already have spent more than $650,000 on the campaigns against the measures with more money expected in the coming weeks. AT&T and Pacific Bell also have been big contributors, fearful that the MUD directors will use state laws to take over the phone and communications utilities in San Francisco, as well. 

Public power critics say there are too many unknowns in the proposals, chief among them the cost. 

City Controller Ed Harrington noted that a disputed 1997 study commissioned by the San Francisco PUC estimated the value of PG&E's distribution system at $800 million. Other estimates have ranged from $300 million to $1 billion. 

""A lot of people are not happy with PG&E. But neither of these measures can guarantee that they're going to solve the state's power problem, or provide us better, more reliable or cheaper service,"" said Jim Mathias, vice president of public affairs for the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. ""The unknown could be worse."" 

Proponents, however, say a public power system answers to voters and ratepayers, not corporate shareholders. Historically, such public power systems have had lower rates. 

""The only unknowns are ephemeral because we've seen through the Sacramento MUD, the Alameda MUD and the Los Angeles public power authority that rates are lower and service is better,"" said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, a public power advocate.

THE MUD MEASURES


San Francisco voters face two public power measures on the Nov. 6 ballot. . 

-- PROPOSITION F 

Placed on the ballot by the Board of Supervisors, the measure would: 

-- Abolish San Francisco's Public Utilities Commission and replace it with a Municipal Water and Power Agency. The agency would be governed by an elected seven-member board of directors. 

-- Authorize the agency to take over the existing Hetch Hetchy Water and Power system, which is now operated by the city PUC. 

-- Order a feasibility study to determine the costs and benefits of providing public power to San Francisco consumers. 

-- Operate with the goal of ending Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s control of electricity distribution in San Francisco and create a public power system that would sell electricity directly to residents and businesses. It also would continue to provide water and sewer service, as the local PUC has. 

-- Allow the agency to issue revenue bonds without approval by the Board of Supervisors or voters. Any bond issue of more than $100 million would be subject to referendum. 

-- Require the new agency to maintain some ties to City Hall. For example, the Board of Supervisors would have to approve the use of eminent domain to take over PG&E's distribution lines and generation facilities. 

. 

-- PROPOSITION I 

Placed on the ballot by initiative, the measure would: 

-- Establish a Municipal Utility District for both San Francisco and Brisbane. The district would be run by an elected five-member board of directors. Candidates for the director posts also are on the Nov. 6 ballot. 

-- Give directors the authority to determine whether to take over PG&E's electrical and distribution system in San Francisco, as well as the Hetch Hetchy system, in order to provide publicly owned power directly to ratepayers. 

Requires a feasibility study of such an action. Subsequent voter approval of specific projects probably would be required. 

-- Allow the district to investigate whether it should provide water, transportation, garbage collection, telephone, communications and sewer services, as allowed by state law governing municipal utility districts. 

-- Give the MUD power as a state agency, independent of the Brisbane and San Francisco local governments, allow the directors to undertake eminent domain proceedings and provide authority to issue revenue bonds. 

 

Power plant assessment to be taken over by state

Over protests from cities that fear a sharp loss in revenue, the state Board of Equalization voted yesterday to take over the appraisal of power generators but postponed doing so for one year. 

The delay until Jan. 1, 2003, is designed to give the Legislature time to fix what opponents call a ""fatal flaw"" in the plan. 

Under the old rule, property tax revenue from power plants was assessed by the counties, with the property tax going to the redevelopment agencies in the city the plant is situated. The board changed that so that the state now assesses the plant, spreading the money out across the county. 

That means big losses for a city such as Pittsburg, which has been fighting the plan. The city -- which has two new power plants -- expected $10 million in property tax revenue. With the changes, that will be reduced to just $400,000, said John Knox, an attorney hired by the city. 

Pittsburg Vice Mayor Frank Aiello said the property tax revenue was one reason the city agreed to have the plants built in its community. 

""You'll see more and more power plants not being sited,"" he told the board. ""There will be an even bigger energy crisis."" 

He said the move will have a ""devastating effect"" on the city's redevelopment agency. 

Supporters of the plan believe power generators have gotten off too easy under local assessors. That is because counties are barred from increasing assessments more than 2 percent a year under Proposition 13.

 
 
Ontario Electricity Market Inches Closer To Deregulation
 
CALGARY -(Dow Jones)- The province of Ontario opened another door to electric deregulation Wednesday, issuing tough new emission standards for industry and lifting a two-year moratorium on the sale of provincially owned coal-fired generation plants. 

Loosening Ontario Power Generation's hold on the bulk of the province's power plants is critical to launching an electricity market slated to open by May 2002 - after three delays in as many years. 

""Putting additional generation assets in the hands of competition to OPG is one of the primary objectives,"" said John Dalton, director at Navigant Consulting Inc. in Toronto. 

The utility has five coal-fired power plants, including the 4,000-megawatt Naticoke and 1,975-MW Lambton stations where the government has accepted OPG installing selective catalytic reduction units to cut down smog, rather than converting to other fuels. 

""Right now, without putting these generation assets under the control of competition, essentially we don't have a power market, we have a regulatory scheme,"" Dalton said. 

Sale of the plants had been put on hold until the environment ministry finalized its anti-pollution regulations. The new rules issued Wednesday by Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer will cap emissions by fossil fuel-burning generation stations starting Jan. 1, and will be fully implemented by 2007. 

Under the government's plan for deregulation, OPG must sell or lease about 4,00 MW of non-nuclear power within 42 months of market opening. The utility owns 9,700 MW of fossil-fuel capacity, 8,728 MW of nuclear power and 7,309 MW of hydroelectric power. 

""Lifting the moratorium goes a long way toward OPG moving quickly to its decontrol program, and preparing for an open market,"" OPG spokesman John Earl said 

This latest move has the industry optimistic that the provincial government could open electricity markets by early rather than late spring. 

""We're working on being ready for March 1,"" an industry source told Dow Jones Newswires. ""There will be lots of supply on the market because the economy is slower than anticipated and demand is down. That's what the government wants, lots of supply and some choice for consumers."" 

A separate regulation finalized Wednesday ordered OPG's aging Lakeview plant to stop burning coal by 2005. 

The edict gave new life to the four units that faced being completely shut down, but still doesn't make them that attractive to buyers, Dalton said. 

Lakeview operates about 30% of the year at a lower fuel cost than cleaner-burning natural gas plants. Converting to an alternative fuel will increase cost on units that are last on the fossil fuel plant list to be dispatched - meaning they will run even fewer hours and at lower rates. 

  

FERC to give states a role in RTO formation 

WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - U.S. federal energy regulators on Wednesday pledged to create a new body to cooperate with state officials on the planning of regional transmission grid combinations after complaints that they were left out of the process. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the country's power grid operators, has ordered utilities in the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and West to combine their assets into a handful of regional transmission organizations (RTOs) by the end of the year. 

The agency has pushed hard to create the RTOs to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter, in which the antiquated U.S. grid prevented more power from flowing into the state. 

FERC commissioners acknowledged on Wednesday that some changes were needed to address criticism from state utilities regulators that they were left out of the RTO rule-making process. 

STATES GET SEAT AT THE TABLE 

FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell, a former Pennsylvania regulatory official, proposed creating a regional council that would share authority between FERC and states on setting RTO policies. 

Citing states' confusion about FERC's direction and inconsistent internal agency communication, Brownell, in a memo to commissioners, said the council ""can provide the necessary flexibility that we will likely need moving forward to RTO formation."" 

The request was made by David Svanda, commissioner of the Michigan Public Service Commission, on behalf of six other Midwest states at FERC's workshop on RTOs last week. 

The move is ""a ceding of jurisdiction ... to state regulators for us to co-govern the process with them,"" FERC Chairman Pat Wood told reporters after the meeting. Wood previously headed Texas' state utility regulatory agency. 

Of state commissions, Wood said ""they need to be invited with a nice seat at the table, not just standing at the door taking tickets."" 

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS PROMISED 

FERC also promised to prepare a formal cost-benefit analysis of RTOs for states and consumers, after some states raised concerns that the costs did not justify the benefits. The agency did not say when the study would be completed. 

On Tuesday, the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) released its own cost-benefit study, which asserted the creation of a large Northeastern RTO could boost consumer power bills by some $90 million a year. 

The non-profit New York ISO would also be put out of business by a regional for-profit RTO. 

However, a separate study issued last month by energy firm Mirant Corp , a supporter of RTOs, concluded that a Northeastern RTO would save consumers $440 million annually. 

At the meeting, FERC commissioners heard staff presentations on RTO development progress in the Southeast, Northeast and Midwest. 

But few new details emerged on the ultimate direction FERC will take in guiding utilities. 

Wood said that more specifics would be available at the next meeting on Nov. 7, just a month ahead of FERC's Dec. 15 deadline for RTO membership. 

Under FERC's plan, the RTOs would be for-profit groups in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access, more reliable power and lower rates for consumers.

Stocks Close Higher As Investors Cheer Earnings News
By Peter Edmonston

The Wall Street Journal Online 
Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03 after gaining 40.89 points Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, or 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session. 
Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50. 
Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened. 
The stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation. Additionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment. 
But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday. ""The market is really shrugging off this news,"" said Mark Donahoe, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 
Upbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seemed to give stocks an additional lift. 
Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness, Crepsi & Hardt. 
The uncertainty on the global front ""looks like it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair,"" Mr. Kroll said. ""I think stocks will revert back to being earnings-driven."" 
Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations. ""The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings,"" said Mr. Donahoe of U.S. Bancorp. That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he added. 
Still, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll argued. 
Third-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel posting results that met or topped analysts' estimates. 
The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m. EDT when index component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain items, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates. 
The financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cents a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cents a share, for the latest quarter. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, closing up 3.4% at $30.32. 
Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5.4%. The rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tencor. 
U.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy. But excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7% to $14.74. 
Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% decline in net income. And oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily beat analysts' forecasts. 
But not all the earnings news was cheery. Local phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates. Shares of SBC, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40. 
Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging, some analysts noted. On Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Steel told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be ""difficult."" 
Companies ""are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down the fourth quarter,"" said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt. He said that some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buying activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option contracts, an event known as ""double witching."" 
One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. Shares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65. 
Overseas, stocks closed higher. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower. 
In economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. The index -- a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, the Conference Board said. Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading. 
In August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous estimate of a 0.3% decline. Even so, the back-to-back declines paint a bleak economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. 
The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said. The overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown. 
In major U.S. market action: 
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares were traded, 1,813 stocks rose and 1,291 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.49 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note rose less than 1/16 point Monday, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.618%. The 30-year bond fell 1/16 point to yield 5.364%. 
The dollar rose. The dollar bought 122.56 yen, compared with 121.20 yen late Friday. The euro traded at 89.18 U.S. cents, down from 89.84 cents late Friday.

Enron Faces Holder Suit From Fincl Chief Pacts

10/22/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A shareholder of Enron Corp. (ENE) filed a derivative suit in Texas court alleging that Enron's board breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
In a press release Monday, a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest.
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars. 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it will take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships. 
On Oct. 19, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in Dec. 1999 principally to do business with Enron. 
Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments. 
Enron's New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on Monday following news that the SEC requested additional information. 
A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it does not comment on pending litigation.

Shapiro Haber & Urmy Files Class Action on Behalf of Purchasers of Enron Corporation Stock (NYSE: ENE) in The Period From July 13, 2001 Through October 16, 2001

10/22/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)
BOSTON, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP has filed a class action suit alleging securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), 515 Rusk Ave., Houston, Texas 77002, against Enron Corporation (""Enron"") (NYSE: ENE) and certain of its officers and directors. 
The case was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period from July 13, 2001 through October 16, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").
The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""the Exchange Act""), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period. The complaint charges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion. The price of Enron's common stock plummeted over 20% in just three trading days following disclosure of the financial losses resulting from Enron's dealings with these partnerships. 
Plaintiff seeks to recover damages suffered by class members and is represented by the law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP, which has successfully prosecuted numerous securities class actions on behalf of defrauded investors. More information about the firm and its qualifications is available on the firm's website at www.shulaw.com. 
If you are a member of the class described above, you may wish to join the action. You may move the court to serve as a lead plaintiff no later than December 21, 2001.

billion in refunds.  The filing is submitting comments to FERC.   The ISO 
said that the purpose of the filing is to ask FERC to be more aggressive in 
their approach to market mitigation and provide context to FERC for its 
decision.  The report the ISO staff has done covers the period from May 2000 
to Feb 2001 and calculates that prices exceeded what they would expect in a 
competitive market by $6.2 billion. The ISO states that it is not claiming 
that these are overcharges. They understand that other factors are in play 
and that the ISO does not  have access to the generator cost data -- so they 
are unable to say how much of the dollars are overcharges.

ISO General Counsel said he can't tell how much is an overcharge, how much 
should be refunded, how much might be unjust and unreasonable.  ISO is 
working with other state agencies, AG, CPUC, EOB, and don't know if the 
action should be taken at FERC, the courts, ...

likely come as a great shock to David, so I want your thoughts/input on how 
to handle.  For example, getting this type of news by phone would be tough.  
Do I need to go to Singapore, or does HR have someone in Singapore who can 
deliver the message directly/face-to-face.  The reasons for termination are 
as follows:

1  out of his depth on technical side of EBS;

2  Has been found to be deficient in some meetings in which he has 
participated with commercial team, e.g., has begun to explain, or interrupted 
explanations of others, and then been unable to complete explanation 
(probably due to weaknesses in item 1, above), but, in any event, makes for 
less than wholly satisfacotry meeting from commercial perspective (per Bill 
White, EBS Asia bandwidth trader);

3  Has been found sorely wanting in terms of being a good team player, taking 
credit for work of others, being patronising, and too easily asking for 
assistance from others (including me) when he could do his own research 
(especially after I have given him a pretty clear steer on where to do the 
research);

4  Has not really ever understood the Enron business model (market making; 
assets not for assets sake, but to serve the trading platform).

The positive:  good work ethic, good written communications.  I found him 
pleasant, but I do not discount that when dealing with peers/subordinates, he 
did suffer the behavioural deficiencies noted in point 3 above.

My thoughts are that we provide him sufficient advance notice, and pay, so 
that he is not left in a far away and expensive place, without income (though 
he is a retired foreign service officer, so he will ot be suffering 
hardship).  I need your guidance on this.  He is almost certainly over 40 
(though I do not make his age my business), so I will also look to you to 
make sure that this is appropriately handled for someone in a ""protected 
class"", as I would appreciate the employment laws.  I think we need to commit 
to move him back to the USA at our cost, though if he gets new employment in 
singapore, or an employer who is willing to pay for his move, we should not 
be on the hook (though if our paying to move him back to the USA helps him 
get a job, then that should not be an issue or impediment).

Late last night, the House on a 240-189 vote passed, as amended, H.R. 4 -- the Securing Amerca's Future Energy (SAFE) Act of 2001.  Here is what happened on the three amendments of interest to Enron:

	1.	The House overwhelmingly defeated (154 to 274) a Waxman Amendment (D-CA)  to impose cost of service rates on wholesale sales of electricity in the WSCC for 18 months.  Only three House Republicans supported the amendment (all from California -- Gallegly, Issa and Hunter); 57 Democrats opposed the Waxman Amendment, including all of the Texas Democrats EXCEPT Frost, Hinojosa, Rodriguez and Doggett (these four SUPPORTED the Waxman Amendment).  Thus, our collective lobbying efforts in recent months focusing on California Republicans, Texas Democrats and other moderate Democrats worked out in the end.

	2.	The House also overwhelmingly defeated the Cox Amendment (R-CA) to grant California a waiver of the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline.  The vote was 125 to 300 (44 Republicans, 80 Democrats and 1 independent voted for the amendment; 173 Republicans, 126 Democrats and 1 independent) voted against it.

	3.	The House also defeated the Green Amendment (D-TX) to repeal the Natural Gas Act's ""Hinshaw Exemption"" as it applies to California's intrastate natural gas pipelines.  The vote was 154 to 275 (123 Republicans and 31 Democrats voted for it, while 95 Republicans, 178 Democrats, and 2 independents voted against the amendment).

Please call or e-mail with comments or questions.  The Senate Energy Committee is starting its work this week on an energy package with consideration of an R&D title (other issues will be taken up in September, including electricity).

We have people leaving as we reorganize or reduce activities in certain areas and we have people moving to other areas or being hired into areas where we are starting new businesses or growing.  We simply have not had the mass layoffs that other companies have announced.

1909,"I initiated the group earlier this year, with the attached terms of 
reference.  To kick the process off, I included some key documents on market 
structure issues we have been working on in England and Wales.  
Unfortunately, I got no response to my suggestions for the groups working 
methods nor any additional contributions on market structure issues from 
other group members.  As a result, although the group has not been 
terminated, I cannot really claim that it functioned as a group either.

I saw the deliverable from the group as exchanging information and ideas to 
use in our individual efforts.  I did not see the group as having concrete 
deliverables (eg, a global Enron position on X which would be unlikely to fit 
the unique circumstances of each of the markets that we find ourselves 
operating in).  The question is whether this information exchange needs to be 
achieved through a formal group with limited membership or through extension 
of our internal Govt Affairs network.  A valuable way in which this has been 
achieved is through group ""get togethers"" such as the conference, our UK 
offsite which some US colleagues attended and the Thailand effort - all of 
which provide a good way to meet our colleagues and establish contacts.  A 
formal group is always likely to suffer somewhat from conflicting, immediate 
priorities.   The challenge is to ensure that on those occasions where such 
exchange makes a real difference to the outcome of our regulatory efforts 
that we leverage our internal contacts and international experience 
appropriately.  I suspect that much of this work already gets done 
informally, eg, recent exchange of information notes on California, help from 
London on performance standards to support our Indian efforts etc.

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com

Phone glut

Lucent continues to suffer. Will the stock recover anytime soon? And will
overcapacity problems in the industry spread to other telecom stocks?

By Michael Sivy

Lucent [LU] is the Florida of the telecom sector. It's big, it's booming
and it can't stop bungling. Lucent's latest foul-up was announced Tuesday:
The company said it would have to revise down the results reported for the
September quarter because of errors in the way sales were recorded. Even
worse, management said it won't be able to provide analysts with reliable
earnings guidance for the current quarter.

The real problem isn't the money -- third-quarter earnings will be hit by
just about 2 cents a share -- it's the principle of the thing. Investors
always turn skeptical when a company overstates its prospects only to lower
its sights later on. And Lucent has been pulling the rug out from under
analysts all year. Investors get even more nervous when a company mentions
accounting mistakes, no matter how small or innocent they seem. So Lucent's
most recent announcement sent the stock as low as $16.50, down more than 75
percent from the start of the year, before recovering to $17.75.

Lucent's latest troubles raise several questions for investors: What are
the company's problems? What are the implications for the entire telecom
sector? And what do Lucent's recurrent selloffs mean for value-oriented
investors in today's market? The last question is easiest to answer. We're
in the middle of a downtrend for technology stocks. Companies that
disappoint investors will receive little mercy. And it's very easy to get
burned by a stock that appears to have bottomed. I feel that particularly
keenly, since I recommended Lucent in July as a value play at $44 a share,
after it was already down nearly 50 percent from its all-time high (see
""The shining"").
[ http://www.money.com/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000731.html ]

As for Lucent's problems, two are unique to the company itself, and both
result from its spinoff from AT&T in 1996. For more than a century, Lucent
had been able to rely on the Bell System as a captive customer, and so the
newly independent company failed to keep up with competitors in key areas
like optical technology. Second, Lucent is still reshuffling top management
to find a team that can get both the product line and the accounting system
in good running order.

The broader question is what Lucent's troubles indicate about the telecom
sector. Basically, the entire sector is suffering from various forms of
overcapacity. All the telecom companies geared up in one way or another for
much more business than has actually materialized. The result -- when
supply outruns demand -- is cutbacks in purchases of capital equipment and
falling prices.

Those short-term problems can be painful, but excess capacity always gets
used up -- and often far faster than analysts expect. So I imagine that
within a year or two, all telecom companies will face a firmer pricing
environment and their share prices will rally.

I believe that investors who want to build a long-term position in
technology need to own telecom stocks. It's impossible to know when any
particular stock will bottom -- in the short run, any telecom-related stock
could go lower, and not even the most successful, such as Cisco [CSCO] and
Nortel Networks [NT], are completely safe. But stocks like AT&T [T] and
WorldCom [WCOM], as well as Lucent, all are trading at least a third below
their asset value. You have to buy when stocks look undervalued and then
hang on without flinching if they go lower. The long-term profit potential
is there. And the best protection is diversification and patience.

1952,"Joe Henry and I met with Andrew Kidd and David Field of El Paso today to discuss the timeline and status for the sale of Cornhusker.  Additional topics included the incremental land/option agreement between the project comapny and Tenaska (a potential $7.5 mm deduct from our sales proceeds) and the requirement of El Paso to purchase the ""black box"" equity to finish their due diligence on the equity and the prior ""facilitation process.""

SCHEDULE

El Paso will be meeting with Ralph Eads tomorrow afternoon to present a final valuation and risk summary.  After this they will forward over their marked PSA and would like to meet Thursday/Friday to finish the agreement.  After finishing the agreement, the deal will go to El Paso for Capital Review Board and BOD meeting.  We will then have only the ""black box"" purchase/put timing and HSR to go for closing/funding.

VALUE

David and Andrew pointed out their aggressive discount rate a number of times and point to increasing insurance costs on power facilities as the ""90%"" driver of a likely decrease in purchase price (our insurance folks can attest to the increase).  El Paso estimates an 8 to 9 mm dollar price reduction from these increased costs.  The latest increase from our insurance was substantial too, but not this high.  We are doing a quick variance on our numbers vs the ""sent"" model and will match insurance parties at El Paso and Enron today/tomorrow.

El Paso doesn't have any interest in the incremental land/option (nor do we), so Ponderosa is going to sell the project company with the option to Tenaska intact.  This outcome is the lowest legal risk for Enron and almost a ""no-cost"" alternative which maximises our net cash received from the purchase.

El Paso will assume the Siemens Westinghouse long term service agreement risk and has not asked for an indemnification on the matter.  Hopefully the PSA will match.

FUTURE UPDATES

I will send an update to this same distribution list as frequency demands.  If any of the recipients believe I should include additional people, please email the names back to me.

1.  Increasing contract price of no more than $6.2MM, from $46.5MM to $52.7MM (note however that this increase is spread over the construction schedule - no cash out until NTP is given).
2.  Lowering the specific performance targets for line losses on the asset from 5.9% to 4.3%.  The NPV associated with the lower line losses offsets the increase in contract price.  
3.  ENA option to give NTP any time between June and December 31.  After NTP is given, ABB will have 15.5 months to deliver the asset.

We sent a proposal to ABB (providing for a contract increase of only $3.0MM even though $6.2 works economically) last week (attached).  On the customer side, Enron de Mexico is still working with DeAcero and the CFE.  The current agreement with DeAcero expires a the end of June.

We are also pitching the deal to GM and Ford in the U.S., as well as Kimberly Clark in Mexico.  I am trying to get to Detroit within the next couple of weeks (we are exchanging CA's with GM).  We have filed the Presidential Permit application - it should be public in a week or so.  I am hoping this will help stir demand in the U.S.

There should be no change in valuation.  We have run the ABB proposal by RAC and they approved it, subject of course to management approval.

1973,"I have just been informed that our P&L was overstated by approx $6 million on Friday.   Since it is quarter end, we are re-calcing to avoid numerous audit issues that would result.   The mistake was due to vol curves rolling forward one month (May became June, June became July, July became Aug, etc.).

Starting tommorow, Harry will be responsible for marking all vol curves for East Power.   The vol curve changes that Harry will be making over the next two days will result in a marginal gain in desk P&L (1-2 million).   Most of the regional books gain value due to short vol position, however, the New Albany spread option loses a corresponding amount.

The recent risk group difficulties are compounded by the Portland risk group being down to 2 people (total experience of 3 months) and many of our resources are getting sucked into West issues.   Continued system difficulties combined with understaffing has resulted in more frequent mistakes.

The $23 million of P&L for Friday business can be reconciled as follows:
$6 million from Thursday mistake (P&L understated on Thursday because Wednesday curves were used after Port Calc failed)
$10 million in ""true"" Friday P&L (summer 01, Cal 02 & Cal 03 all down approx. $1/Mwh)
$6 million overstated due to vol curve being off by one month from incorrect roll in vol curves.

The final P&L issued by 2:00 pm today (for COB Friday) will be approx. $17 million.

1975,"Louise - some news and views for yourself on this credit.

Hedging this name for any duration past 5 years is all but impossible at present.
Insurance companies will write protection, with 10% first loss being taken by ENE; but proof of loss must exist and all covents must be adhered to otherwise payout can be made void.   Believe the offering you have from Zurich should be used to cover first 35 mil of 65 mil exposure at the front end.   This is the cheapest alternative but does come with certain hindrances; ie timeliness of payments and proof of loss.   An additional constraint here is the BB or better private rating ENE must get for Deacero.

What EnronCredit can offer is to hedge the excess exposure above the insurance coverage.   We would cover failure to pay and bankruptcy of said name.  We would offer protection in either a 2 or 3 year rolling tranche format.    Protection can either be bought for the duration (15yrs NPV) at 3.5%, cash settlement (Louise you get paid out 100- recovery (of financial assets)= payout).  Or on a rolling basis at 30 Bpts over where EnronCreit hedges itself in the market (expect to get 2 yr protection off at 2% per annum at present).    We have the ability to structure this tranche on an accreting or amortising basis to either suit the P95 or actual exposures (payment can be made digital; cost would be stated cost/(1-.35%(expected recovery)).

Louise if you want to call me today to discuss I will be in till 18:00 London time.

This marketing effort is at the core of what ENA - Wholesale Gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help.

2013,"Market Forces - ENymex still on launchpad.

09/07/2001
Energy Compass
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved

The New York Mercantile Exchange has been thinking about shifting some of its
business online since early last year - - and possibly before that - when it
was invited to join the electronic IntercontinentalExchange (ICE). It rejected
the offer - which rival International Petroleum Exchange has since gladly
accepted - instead unveiling plans last May to build its own electronic
trading platform for over-the-counter and smaller futures contracts. But its
cyberspace initiative is still on the launchpad.

Called eNymex, the online system was supposed to launch in October 2000, at
the same time as the Big Oil-backed ICE. But October came and went, and while
ICE appeared, eNymex failed to show. Its start date was pushed back to late
2000 - and then to the first quarter of 2001, and then to the second quarter
of this year. Nymex held to that second-quarter target for months, before
again failing to deliver. It's now given up on the third quarter as well, and
exchange executives have stopped trying to predict when the electronic trading
platform will be ready to go.
That's not the only blow to Nymex's e-trade strategy. Delays are also plaguing
an internet version of its existing Access after-hours electronic trading
system, although it remains available as a proprietary, dial-up system to
existing customers.

Late last month, Nymex announced plans to make Access available over the
internet - at www.nymexaccess.com - in a move designed to widen its customer
base. But just a few days before the planned Sep. 3 start date, the exchange
pulled back (EC Aug.31,p3). As with eNymex, a new date has yet to be
scheduled. Launched in 1993, the dial-up version of Access handled 2.1 million
contracts last year, equal to 2% of Nymex's total trading volume. Nymex
executives say that putting Access on the web could triple the volume of
business completed on the platform. The exchange's new Brent crude oil futures
contract and other existing pit-traded contracts are available on Access.

Compared with ICE - which is steadily unveiling new services and products on
its e-trade system - the New York exchange's path to building an electronic
platform has been bumpy. Earlier this year, Nymex ended its relationship with
Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting), which had been involved in managing
the exchange's transition to an electronic trading platform almost from the
start. Some observers characterized the move as a cost-cutting measure; Nymex
says Accenture was dismissed because its work was done.

Nymex blames many of the delays on GlobalView Software, one of its technology
partners, with which it is involved in a bitter legal dispute. In April, Nymex
filed a breach of contract lawsuit in a New York court against GlobalView,
alleging that the Chicago-based software firm had stopped work on eNymex, and
seeking unspecified damages. GlobalView chief executive Jon Olson admits that
his company did indeed stop work, but says it was because Nymex stopped
paying. It is countersuing, seeking around $26 million for fees and damages.
Nymex president Bo Collins is also claiming that GlobalView has gone bankrupt.
But Olson says business is good for the 20-year-old company, which has around
150 clients in the energy industry.

With GlobalView off the project, Nymex has decided it will build the
""front-end"" piece of eNymex - the part that GlobalView was working on.

When it's all complete, Nymex will have an e-trade platform for derivatives
and smaller futures contracts, and a separate e-trade service for its
after-hours customers. It will also have its existing pit-traded contracts,
which it has no intention of ditching.

With so many different pieces, some observers wonder what Nymex is up to.
Collins, a one-time natural gas trader at US-based El Paso, responds that
Nymex aims to build an ""electronic cloud"" around its successful pit contracts.
Rather than disrupt a successful business, Collins says the exchange is
creating new, electronic trading opportunities around its pit-traded products.

""The reality is we have a system of pit trading that provides immense
liquidity to the market,"" he says. ""So I have got to figure out a way to marry
the technology to the humanness of the process.""

For example, Nymex's Henry Hub natural gas futures contract is successful, and
several types of contracts trade on other exchanges based on the Henry Hub
price. That's where eNymex will come in, Collins says: The e-trade platform
will offer spread and basis swaps contracts based on prices of Nymex's pit
contracts - thus marrying technology and the trading pit.

Some observers suggest that the eNymex roll-out has taken a back seat to the
exchange's newest product, a Brent crude oil futures contract challenging the
IPE. The new contract, which started trading on Sep. 5, was joined the
following day by a new Brent options contract. On Sep. 7, the New York
exchange started offering a Brent-WTI spread options contract.

The battle for the hearts and minds of Brent traders will rage in the
traditional trading pits of New York and London for another year, at least.
But over the next 12-18 months, all of the IPE's business will be shifted
online to a futures trading platform being built by ICE.

The IPE's strategy is clear. By agreeing to be acquired by ICE, the London
exchange obviously sees a future where commodities trading takes place in
cyberspace - not in a trading pit. Nymex is betting that its ""electronic
cloud"" strategy - whereby e-trade is married with pit trading - will pay off.

In the end, though, the e-trade versus pit trade battle being waged by the
world's two biggest oil futures exchanges may become secondary to the battle
for Brent. If Nymex can create liquidity in its new Brent contract, its bumpy
path toward e-trade may be forgotten.

In response to some considerable concern voiced by Presto, we are re-evaluating our Broker Client relationships.  I'm planning to send the following email to each of the desk heads.  It is intended primarily to generate feedback from the desks, but my ultimate plan is to shut down the relationships and essentially start over with the desks making the transaction decisions instead of EOL.  Before I launched it, I wanted to get your thoughts.

Thanks,
Brad



Earlier this year, Enron executed deals with certain Broker's which allows the broker to execute transactions for their clients via a Broker Client which is linked to the EnronOnline platform.  All executions done on Broker Client are free of brokerage charges.  To date, about 80% of the 3,400 broker trades executed on-line have been in the US Power segment.  The companies that have access to read and execute transactions using the Broker Client are as follows:

APB Energy, Inc. (Canadian Nat Gas, Canadian Power, US Nat Gas, US Power, US Coal, US Emissions, US Weather, US Crude, US Bandwidth)
Natsource LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Nat Gas, US Coal, US Emissions)
Amerex Natural Gas I, Ltd. (Asian Crude, Bandwidth, US Crude, US Nat Gas, Belgian Nat Gas, Canadian Nat Gas, European Crude)
Amerex Power, Ltd. (Australian Power, Austrian Power, Bandwidth, Canadian Power, Dutch Power, German Power, Nordic Power, Spanish Power, Swiss Power, UK Power, US Power)
Power Merchants Group, LLC (US Financial Nat Gas)
Prebon Energy, Inc. (US Nat Gas, Canadian Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Power, US Coal, US Emissions, US Crude)
Prebon Marshall Yamane (UK) Ltd (UK Gas, UK Power, Continental Power, Continental Gas, European Crude, European Weather, Asian Weather, Asian Crude, European Bandwidth)
Natsource Tullett Europe Limited (UK Nat Gas, UK Power, Continental Gas, Continental Power, European Coal)
GFI EnergyNet LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Gas, Canadian Power)
TFS Energy, LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Nat Gas, Canadian Power, US Bandwidth)

A significant concern has been raised that these relationships have amounted to a free option on the part of the brokers, who will transact with Enron on long-dated product only if they can't find an equal or better price from a supplier who will pay brokerage.  While I am confident that this possibility was discussed when the deals were struck, the current situation calls for some changes.  Accordingly, our plan would be to exercise our right to shut down all Broker Clients immediately.  As a result, we would be forced to return approximately $1.2 MM in fees paid by the brokers listed above.

Let me be clear that this does not preclude future Broker Client arrangements.  The decision to engage in future deals should be made on a commodity-by-commodity and region-by-region basis.  In other words, we can grant access to whichever product types the desks feel comfortable with.  If particular desks have broker relationships that they would like to move on-line in support of their market, the technology and resources are available to make this happen.  What we are currently seeking is simply a reset on the Broker Client product so that we are not employing a ""one-size-fits-all"" solution.

I would welcome your thoughts and comments on this course of action before we decide to proceed.

Thanks,
Brad Richter","Brad

 As we have discussed, when Enron sold HPL to AEP, Enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name ""Houston Pipe Line Company"" as of June 1,2001, were the sole property of AEP/HPL and that no Enron Entity would use that name.
 On or about the first of June, the EOL Long Product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the GTC's for physical natural gas provided that all Enron transactions in Texas were to be deemed HPL transactions, that such language was overridden by the Long Product description.
Notwithstanding this modification to the Long Product description, AEP is claiming that the continued use by EOL in EOL's GTC's violates the Purchase and Sale Agreement and impinges on its trademark ""HPL"".  As we discussed last week, we have  received a letter from AEP threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to HPL from the EOL GTC's.

Based on what has been happening in the past several days, I completely concur that we should not require that any EOL Counterparty ""re-accept"" the physical natural gas GTC's in order to trade with ENRON.

I advise that we either (i) do nothing and risk being sued by AEP, or (ii) that we forget about making any other ""cleanup"" changes requested by Stacy and merely notify the applicable Counterparties that as evidenced by the Long Product description for physical natural gas transactions, all such transactions will continue to be with Enron, not HPL, and that the EOL GTC will be modified as of [date] to eliminate any reference to HPL.

I would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible....such as on the remittance statements in/on our checks to these Counterparties or on our invoices.  We should not ask any Counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this, nor should we request any reacceptance of out EOL GTC .

You have inquired as to the possibility of getting AEP to enter into an agreement with Enron to not change our online GTC at this time.  Frankly, at the present time the relationship between Enron and AEP is quite antagonistic..... we have several matters pending which need to be resolved.......in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the HPL name we would need to ""make it worth their while""..... and due to some of the positions Enron is currently taking, AEP would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions . 

Thus, as I stated earlier, we should either ""do nothing"" and wait for the lawsuit....or go the ""innocuous notice"" route.

I have spoken with Mark Taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances, these are preferable routes to the POP-Up and reacceptance  route which had been in the works for the past few months.

Please fell free to call me with any questions or comments.  If we decide to go the ""notification route"", I will promptly draft the exact language to be used.

2056,"The objective seems to have gotten alittle lost here.

We want the terms to be firm and as specific as the version we had on Friday (although I take point about arbitration and vesting of rest stock - although we have to insert something in here). Bear in mind Umbrella had agreed to these terms and Mark M and Lance were to run them passed Top Gun. Presuming they did, seems to me it is reasonable to assume this is what the deal will actualy be (Lance also mentioned creditor committee had seen Umbrella's term sheet last week).

 The covering memo should be explicit in asking the ee to confirm that if a deal was presented in substantially these terms, they would sign them. The wording needs to be tight and regardless of it's enforceability make above clear. In other words let's make it look as binding as we can.

If we really can't do above let's say so and we can look at plan b. John, it may be best we can achieve here is an indicative draft which we talk with top 20 about and tee them up for real thing circa Jan 10. However let's wait and see if we can get one more draft done for Weds.

Is this the new deal?  For the template and the Wind deal?  Also, does 3.1 (b) allow Enron to sell the processes covered by the patents without any restriction on field of use?

The numbers in the sheet represent what was shown to the DIP lenders last weekend in order to obtain  financing. In many cases all revenues and other items were completely eliminated leaving only operating expense and capital expenditures. We were trying to be as conservative as possible but also show a viable entity going forward. I hope we were not to far off.

What we would like you to do is populate this format with the numbers you believe to be true going forward based on the recent changes. We also need a detailed explanation of what is in the numbers. A few things to remember are:

	This estimate should contain no allocations except for what you believe you salaries and wages would be post reduction (normally paid by Corp)

	Operating expenses includes salaries, outside services, benefits, employee expenses and any other items normally in operating expenses including 
		non employee expenses and taxes other than income taxes.  Please provide as much detail as possible.  There is space for detailed opex at 		the bottom of the page.Call me if you have questions.

	Although in Chapter 11 interest and income taxes are not paid, please provide these to the extent your business unit pays them. We will adjust for 
		entities that are in the filing.

	I understand there is a big global effort to identify assets for sale but please provide your best estimate to date along with the detail and we will 		compare to the global effort.

	Capex and investing should be mandatory only. Please provide detail back up.
	
	To the extent your business has any financing activities please provide. again we will adjust for filing entities.

	We need this as soon as possible but no later than Friday morning 9:00 am.

Our bankruptcy filing requires a cultural change in the cash management pro=
cedures of Enron.  Because of our fiduciary obligation to our creditors, we=
 now must move to centralized cash management.  These new procedures will a=
mend our prior policy.  As management of the ""Debtor"", we should approach e=
ach decision about our business, including cash receipts and disbursements,=
 from the perspective of, ""Does this enhance the value of the Debtor's esta=
te?""  This memo addresses the new policies that are to be immediately imple=
mented both for entities in the Chapter 11 reorganization and entities that=
 have not filed.  There will be a meeting Wednesday, December 5, 2001 at 2:=
00 PM in the Board Room on the 50th floor to discuss the new policies. =20

As a debtor-in-possession (""DIP""), we have new cash flow reporting obligati=
ons and we must develop and adhere to a cash flow budget.  Failure to adher=
e could have serious consequences to our DIP financing availability as well=
 as diminish our credibility with the creditors with whom we must negotiate=
 our ultimate exit from Chapter 11 as a reorganized entity.

All Enron business units (not just the ones in bankruptcy) will need to con=
form to these new requirements because additional entities are likely to be=
 included in the bankruptcy filing, and because it is extremely important f=
or Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirement=
s for the Company. =20

There are special procedures outlined at the end of the memo specifically r=
elating to the business units in bankruptcy (the Debtor business units).

New Processes and Procedures

Until further notice, a newly formed committee, the Cash Flow Management Co=
mmittee (the ""Committee""), will meet daily to review and approve daily paym=
ents and 5-day projections for each business unit.  The Committee will be h=
eaded by George Wasaff and will also consist of Ray Bowen, Dave Gorte, Tim =
DeSpain, Bob Butts, Julia Murray and Lisa Mellencamp.  The Committee will b=
e assisted by our financial advisor, Batchelder & Partners and our outside =
counsel, Weil, Gotshal & Manges.  The Committee will review payments only a=
fter approval by the business units.  Business units remain responsible for=
 their own internal approval processes.

George Wasaff will be the Company's ""Cash Czar"".  His responsibilities will=
 include (i) a review of weekly cash budgets from all business units, (ii) =
presentation of weekly budgets to the Committee for approval, (iii) a revie=
w of daily disbursements for the current and immediately succeeding days an=
d (iv) comparison of actual to budget variances for cash receipts and disbu=
rsements. =20

As outlined in Rick Causey's memo of December 4, 2001, all business units m=
ust provide weekly cash flow projections.  Each week's submission should be=
 accompanied by a sufficiently detailed explanation of any variances betwee=
n budget and actual cash receipts and disbursements for the preceding week.=
 Further details of the exact requirements and format of these projections =
will be provided at the meeting.

All divisions must also provide rolling 5-day cash flow projections through=
 the intranet system by 9:00 am each day.  These 5-day projections must inc=
lude a projection of all cash receipts and disbursements for the subsequent=
 5 business days.  Copies of all supporting documentation should be sent to=
 George Wasaff, Mary Perkins, and Tim DeSpain.  Each business unit will be =
responsible for pre-screening weekly budgets and eliminating any non-essent=
ial payments.  This projection should agree to weekly cash flow projections=
 provided on each Friday for the ensuing calendar week with variances clear=
ly identified.  By working with 5-day rolling projections, we can eliminate=
 the last minute scramble to assure that  the payment is consistent with ou=
r situation.

In order to be eligible for payment, items must appear on the weekly and da=
ily cash flow projections.  Failure to include on both will result in non-p=
ayment.  Since our payments are subject to heightened scrutiny, our general=
 rule is that the practice of same day and manual wires will be discontinue=
d.  In addition, please flag any payments made to related parties as these =
may require separate reporting to the Court.  Any questions on this process=
 should be routed to George Wasaff.

Special Procedures for Debtors (Companies in bankruptcy)

See the attached Exhibit A for a list of the current Debtor Companies.  Add=
itional companies may be added with each having its own petition date.  As =
a general rule, we are legally prohibited from paying any pre-petition liab=
ilities.

The standard for what constitutes pre-petition is:
?=09Were goods delivered to Enron prior to December 2, 2001 (or specific pe=
tition date for entities filing after Dec. 2)?
?=09Were services provided prior to the petition date?
?=09If requests for payment are not clear, the business unit must contact v=
endors and request them to provide an invoice, signed by an officer, statin=
g what portion of the goods or services were delivered pre-petition.
?=09If you are unsure or have any questions, please contact George Wasaff.

You must segregate any pre-petition claims for payment.  In virtually all c=
ases these claims will not appear on the cash disbursement list because we =
are generally prohibited from making payment.  However, the Company does ha=
ve very limited authority to make payment to pre-petition vendors deemed to=
 be ""critical"".  In order for a pre-petition disbursement to be approved, s=
uch disbursement must:  (1) make sound business and operational sense; (2) =
be mission critical; and (3) there must not be a substitute vendor.  The bu=
siness unit heads will be responsible for ensuring that recommendations to =
the Committee for any disbursements to critical pre-petition vendors meet t=
his test.  The Committee's presumption will be that a vendor is not critica=
l.  If you believe that a pre-petition claim clearly meets the ""critical"" t=
est, you may submit it as a clearly flagged item, stating your reasons for =
requested payment.  The Committee and corporate management will consider th=
ese recommendations by the business unit.

Internal Controls

We need to reassess internal controls and determine if changes are required=
, especially in light of recent personnel changes.  All internal controls, =
new and existing, will be subject to review by Andrew Parsons.  He will be =
communicating with you regarding his assessment and requirements for any ch=
anges to be made.

Subject:	RE: Govt Affairs Org Chart

Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.    

Thanks,

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Dear Sir or Madam :
	Enron Corp. (""Enron"") believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron. Further, Enron's Business Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.
 	Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

 
	Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you.
Very truly yours,

Beth has reorganized the front and back office groups enough now that I don't know all of the key individuals anymore.

I have included at the bottom a small list of ""cannot lose"" individuals.  In such a small organization, it would be critical, of course, to have people that can solve problems in any system.  If EnronOnline was shut down, I would also put Belmont, Guadarrama, Hillier, Jenson in the ""cannot lose"" group, and I would make sure that Amanullah was one of the remaining Oracle DBAs.

2136,"It's the week-end!  This is just a general overview , if anyone wants detail, please give me a ring.

In general we are doing OK.  In terms of cash out the door today, we were actually going to be positive until Kinder Morgan refused to send our cash back.  We should be ($5.81mm).

Cut us off:
1. 	FPL (balance of month transactions only)
2.	Enbridge (Consumers)
3.	Proliance
4.	Con Agra
5.	Los Angeles Department of Water
6.	Apache
7.	PSEG (physical gas sales only)
10. 	PowerEx (Cash and Real time only)
11. 	Salt River Project
12.	Pacificorp (NorthWest Cash only)


Issues:
1.	PJM Interconnection LLC - want $30mm LC, we are working with them on their calculation methodology.  Awaiting a letter before we react.
2.	AEP  - We completed $50mm of assignment transactions with them on Friday night.  We also sent them $50mm earlier in the week when they had no contractual rights to it.  They'll be back on Monday!!!!!!!!  They have not cut us. They blinked first!!!!!  
3.	Mirant - Still want the physical gas collateralized.  We have offered to sell it to them.  They are still scheduling.  
4.	NGX -  They have taken our lines to zero.  Peter Keohane is working on it.
5.	Sempra - Sempra are still trading but wanting to take their positions to zero.  
6.	Spinnaker - We MAY have agreed to monetize a position and therefore pay out $3mm plus.
7.	Kinder Morgan - Asked for collateral for the first time ($39mm).  Sent a letter suggesting material breach of contract, we have responded by letter to Park Shaper CFO.
8.	Conoco Contract - Equiva (we gave it to them), Apache, Conoco, Pogo, Sempra, ConAgra, Vitol have all attempted to get collateral under the adequate assurance clause.  
9.	GISB - We appear to have been confirming some transactions under the GISB rather than the Masters.  This is causing problems as it includes the 'adequate assurances' clause.  W&T Offshore Inc, Mirant, Devon, Sequent.  Letters have been sent.

LCs to Cash this week
1. 	Sempra - 50mm
2. 	Reliant - 78.5mm
3. 	Engage - 19mm
4. 	BP - $46.5mm

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
""Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. ""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year."" 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a ""lagging"" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or ""junk""-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. ""That is a positive for credit quality."" 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson.

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a ""death spiral"" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or ""shareholders' equity,"" by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
""Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story,"" Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
""We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company,"" Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. ""This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point."" 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for ""personal reasons."" When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
""I don't know anybody who said that,"" Wasden said. ""What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?"" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
""Enron has been a cult, more than a company,"" he said. ""Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside."" 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
""There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants,"" he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) current problems aren't sending i=
ts key employees running for the door, according to two executive recruiter=
s.=20
While employees at Enron's underperforming units are shopping around for ne=
w jobs, those working for its core wholesale energy trading and retail ener=
gy units seem content, the recruiters told Dow Jones Newswires.
""We've been getting resumes from their international group over the last ye=

 its been a very well-known fact that they're getting out of those business=
es.""=20
Another Houston recruiter, who didn't want to be identified, said he has go=
tten ""a flood"" of resumes from employees at Enron's natural gas and power a=
ssets in South America.=20
Employees at Enron's broadband unit are also sending out resumes, said the =
recruiter. That business has brought the company losses of more than $100 m=
illion this year despite hundreds of layoffs. Enron continues to cut costs =
in its telecom business.=20
Neither recruiter has seen many resumes from Enron's big moneymakers - the =
wholesale energy trading group and the retail energy services group.=20
Some of the lower-level employees of those units have sent out resumes but =
Peterson said he hasn't seen higher-level executives in the job market. How=
ever, he attached a caveat to that statement.=20
""Quite a few of the senior people at Enron have left over the last 6-12 mon=
ths,"" he said.=20
When Enron's share price was flying high last year and early this year, som=
e of Enron's top executives cashed out their stock options and left the com=
pany.=20
Those executives included Cliff Baxter, former vice chairman and chief stra=
tegy officer; Ken Rice, former head of Enron Capital and Trade as well as f=
ormer chief executive of Enron Broadband Services; Kevin Hannon, former pre=
sident of Enron Broadband Services; and Lou Pai, former chairman and chief =
executive of Enron Energy Services.=20
The lure of cashing out lucrative stock options won't cost Enron any more e=
mployees any time soon. The company's share price has fallen too far too qu=
ickly, leaving the options underwater.=20
The company's shares traded as high as $80 early this year. By July the pri=
ce had dropped to around $50, leaving employees with options that were virt=
ually worthless. So Enron told employees it would issue new options in Augu=

Dog Fight

George and Osama decided to settle the war once and for all.  They sat down 
and decided to settle the whole dispute with one big dog fight.  They agreed

that they would have five years to breed the best fighting  dogs in the 
world and whosever dog won would be entitled to dominate the world.

Osama and his dog handler Mohammed found the biggest, meanest Dobermans and 
Rottweilers in the world, then bred them with the biggest, meanest Siberian 
wolves they could find. From the litters, they selected the biggest and 
strongest puppy and trained it day and night to fight to the death.

After five years Osama and Mohammed came up with the biggest, meanest dog 
the world had ever seen.  It's cage needed steel bars that were five inches 
thick and nobody could get near it.

When the day came for the dog fight, George and his dog handler Boudreaux, 
showed up with a nine foot long Dachshund.  It was the strangest looking dog

anyone had ever seen.  Boudreaux said it was a Cajun Dachshund.

Everyone felt sorry for George and Boudreaux because they knew there was no 
way that this poor excuse for a dog could possibly last 10 seconds with 
Osama's big, mean animal.

When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund slowly came out of it's cage, 
wagged it's tail, then waddled over towards Osama's dog.

The Doberman/Rottweiler/Wolf snarled and leaped out of it's cage,then 
charged the poor Dachshund.  But when it got close enough to bite the 
Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened it's mouth and ate Osama's dog in one

bite. There was nothing left at all of the snarling beast.

Osama came up to George and Boudreaux shaking his head in disbelief.  ""We 
don't understand how this could have happened.  We had our best people 
working for five years with the biggest, meanest Dobermans and Rottweilers, 
and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves in the world.  How did you do this?""

""Da's easy"", said Boudreaux, the Cajun.  ""We 'ad our bess plasic surgins 
workin' fo' five year for to make dat alligator look like a weenie dog.""

2192,"Dear John -

The attached worksheet has my perspective on how the tolls should be escalated.

I still think this is a conservative view, since I feel that we would be able to go to these pipes and negotiate a fixed toll for the remainder of the term, or even negotiate out of these contracts for a fee. (I'd love to take a crack at that!)

TCPL is still a wild card, and I did not change the escalations that were shown.  More will not be known with them until they get through their new rate design process, which will probably be another year (since they haven't even filed anything yet).

Call if you have any questions..

Earlier this year when the decision was made to purchase our new GV aircraft, 
we agreed to move forward with plans to sell one of our Falcon 900B's by 
year-end.

This allows for Aviation to maintain a six aircraft domestic fleet, once the 
GV is delivered and operational at the beginning of the 2nd quarter of next 
year.  Our '01 budget forecast is based on this assumption.

A year-end sale avoids ad valorem tax issues.  It reduces our fleet to five 
during the 1st quarter, which is also the limit that we can operate aircraft, 
i.e., several pilots unavailable (at GV flight training during this period).

Gary Fitch advises that Jeff and Joe do not have a preference on which 
aircraft to sell.  Gary prefers selling the Falcon 900B (#N5733), since it 
has only one lavatory.  The aircraft is 12 years old, in excellent condition, 
and has a market value of $20-22 million (lease buy-out of $19 million).

With your concurrence, we will contract with an aircraft broker and place the 
Falcon on the market.

2235,"Ken, at your request, my staff and I met with Robert Hatchett and his team.  
They offered Enron an opportunity to invest in a patented method of 
generating electricity by converting methane to hydrogen and burning hydrogen 
in a high efficiency turbine.  This patent represents an idea, without any 
exhaustive quantitative analysis or research and without any prototype 
demonstrated in the field or a lab.

We politely told Mr. Hatchett that we would review his proposal and get back 
to him.

Subsequently, we conveyed to Mr. Hatchett that a) methane consumption rate 
for an integrated facility based on the subject patent is higher than the 
conventional plant efficiency b) the result in fuel cost is higher c) the 
overall Co2 emissions are probably higher d) there is no economical or 
technical justification to support an investment of Enron funds.  

We informed Bob Hatchett that we would recommend to Enron that Enron not 
invest in the development of this effort.  While we invited Mr. Hatchett to 
respond back to us regarding our analysis, I see no further action required 
by us at this time.

Please let me know if you want us to draft anything from you to Mr. Hatchett 
regarding this subject.

2239,"At UTC's request, yesterday Mike Jackson and I met with Kent Brittan, VP, 
Global Sourcing, and members of his sourcing group.  As you remember, we 
first met Kent when Tom White, Dan Leff, Harold Buchanan and I called on him 
two years ago.  At the time, we presented an early version of a fully bundled 
energy outsource in partnership with Fluor Daniel and a local real estate 
management firm.

Over the last two years, UTC attempted various energy procurement strategies, 
failing to execute any.  

Brittan was very pleased with the content of our revised proposal yesterday, 
and told us he would be taking the revised partnership strategy we discussed 
directly to George David, CEO.  

Brittan will also be taking the preliminary concept to UTC Corporate 
Treasury, to gain its buy in on the financing aspects of the deal required to 
support the demand side management infrastructure investments it so 
desperately needs to affect the energy  consumption reduction to which David 
committed two years ago.

Barring a problem there, it appears we have finally engaged UTC in an 
exclusive negotiating relationship that would yield a large scale outsource 
of energy supply and demand side investment operations in all the UTC 
companies, excepting Carrier.    Carrier continues to insist it be treated 
separately, and Brittan has decided to carve it out, rather than hold up the 
entire deal.  I think that strategy is part of what he will be speaking to 
David about.

I requested, and Brittan agreed, that Karl Kropic (COO) be the executive 
sponsor.

Mike Jackson who has worked on and off with UTC over the past 18 months will 
be the lead Originator for EES moving forward.","Mike Jackson Kent Brittan Kent Tom White Dan Leff Harold Buchanan George David David

Military illiteracy  
Washington, DC -- The April 1 collision between a People's Liberation Air  
Force F-8 fighter and a US Navy EP-3 over the South China Sea has revealed a  
striking military weakness. As the 11-day standoff over the fate of 24 of our  
military personnel detained by the communist Chinese unfolded, the masters of  
the media went into high gear to explain to the American people what was  
going on. The potentates of the press did an adequate job of reporting on the  
political dynamic in our nation's capital; on the diplomatic exchanges  
between Beijing and Washington; and on the anxieties of loved ones waiting at  
home. But when it came to reporting on the military aspects of the incident,  
they failed miserably. Strangely enough, almost no one noticed -- in large  
part because the American media and the American people suffer from the same  
malady: military illiteracy. Some examples: From the day of the collision  
onward, nearly every US media outlet referred repeatedly to the damaged US  
aircraft -- a 45-year old, four-engine turbo-prop -- as a ""spy-plane."" It's  
not. A ""spy plane"" (the U-2 or SR-71, for example) is designed to overfly an  
adversary's territory. The sturdy old EP-3 however, is designated as a  
""reconnaissance and surveillance"" aircraft, and it conducts its mission of  
collecting electronic emissions by flying in international airspace or over  
""friendly territory."" The difference between ""surveillance aircraft"" and ""spy  
plane"" is not a simple matter of semantics -- it is an important distinction  
that affords the EP-3 and its crew protections in international law. Not  
unexpectedly, the use of the term ""spy plane"" in the US media was immediately  
picked up by the international press and Communist China's propaganda  
machine. A less egregious example of military illiteracy is evident in  
listening to what the media call those who serve in the Armed forces. At  
various times during the 11 days our 24 military personnel were detained,  
network newsreaders referred to them as ""soldiers"" or ""troops,"" and  
occasionally as ""intelligence specialists."" The cable ""news hounds"" made  
similar errors last October, when terrorists attacked the USS Cole in Yemen  
and the masters of the media repeatedly described the sailors killed and  
wounded aboard the vessel as ""soldiers."" It is tempting to ascribe these  
inaccuracies to media malevolence, an undercurrent of antipathy toward the US  
military. And members of the armed forces can perhaps be forgiven their  
paranoia when they are treated to ""investigative reports"" like CNN's  
""Tailwind"" broadcast, in which it was falsely alleged that US forces employed  
Sarin nerve gas against US ""defectors"" in Vietnam. But in fact, it appears  
that most of the factual errors in today's media coverage of our military  
stem less from malice than from ignorance. And that's not just a media  
problem -- it's becoming a national predicament. How is it that so many know  
so little about military life today that they cannot distinguish between a  
""soldier"" and a ""sailor""? The answer lies in part with the ""success"" of the  
""all volunteer force"" -- now in its 26th year. Once we abandoned selective  
service -- the draft -- military recruiters were forced to appeal to an  
increasingly narrow cross-section of young Americans to fill the ranks. Gone  
is the challenge of patriotism and service that had motivated young men from  
all walks of life to join the military. Douglas MacArthur's ""Duty, honor,  
County"" was replaced with a bald bounty system. Sheer greed -- cold hard cash  
-- became the Pentagon's answer to enlisting those with critical skills  
essential to today's increasingly complex and technology-based military. In  
1963, when my Naval Academy classmates and I first swore to ""support and  
defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and  
domestic ..."" it was the commander in chief who administered the oath. Many  
have found fault with John Kennedy since that day, but not in his appeal that  
we should ""ask not what our country can do for you, but what you can do for  
your country."" That sentiment is heard no longer. And the effect is seen not  
just in military recruiting shortfalls, but throughout our society. General  
James L. Jones, commandant of the Marine Corps, recently noted that, ""The  
average citizen, even the average congressman, neither knows nor cares about  
national security ..."" and that ""congressmen and senators no longer vie for  
seats on the House or Senate Armed Services Committees."" He's right. Fewer  
than one in 10 new recruits even knows a military veteran, and only four out  
of 100 Americans personally know someone in uniform. It should be instructive  
that the military hero of the moment, Navy Lt. Shane Osborn, who saved the  
lives of his EP-3 crew by successfully piloting his badly damaged aircraft to  
a safe landing, says that he was motivated to become a flyer by his high  
school football coach, an Air Force veteran. But Osborn's experience is  
increasingly rare. Today, many educators, especially those who came of age  
during the ""Vietnam era,"" remain hostile to military service and even go so  
far as to deny military recruiters access to high schools. George Orwell  
wrote, ""We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night  
to visit violence on those who would do us harm."" If we expect to remain safe  
in our beds, we would do well to get smart about our armed forces ","Oliver North

PC Connection Buys Exploding Gerbils

Cyberian Outpost and its Outpost.com site, best known for gimmicks
such as free overnight shipping and amusingly tacky commercials, have
been scooped up by rival hardware seller PC Connection. All things
considered, this was probably a better move than that Super Bowl ad
with the gerbil cannon.

PC Connection will acquire Outpost in an all-stock deal alternately
described as ""complicated"" and ""complex."" We won't attempt to explain
it, either; News.com did a pretty good job. It's simpler to describe
Outpost's sorry state: Various reporters noted that the company cut 30
percent of its staff last month, it has credit problems, and
executives have been fleeing in Yahoo-like numbers. And those
off-the-wall commercials exemplified bad dot-com marketing circa 1999,
since they cost a fortune and didn't even mention what Outpost.com
sold. Plenty of journalists ignored Outpost's notorious marketing
history - whether out of respect or amnesia, we're not sure.

Cyberian Outpost is more than a dot-bomb, so a few outlets tipped
their hats to the six-year-old biz. It ""pioneered selling computer
equipment on the Internet,"" said the Newsfactor Network, and it ""has
long been known for its customer service efforts."" The AP said the
deal ""combines two of the Internet's best known computer and software
resellers"" and quoted PC Connection's CEO gushing about Outpost's
""very strong following.""

The Hartford Courant seemed to mourn the sale of Outpost, ""one of
(Connecticut's) best-known Internet retailers,"" though Outpost.com
will hang on to its brand name and continue operating out of
Connecticut. Home-state loyalty aside, the Courant's John Moran
provided solid coverage of Outpost's rise and fall.

PC Connection's CEO acknowledged that job cuts are likely, though he's
""hoping that we can achieve a lot of it through attrition."" As long as
he doesn't shoot anyone out of a cannon. - Jen Muehlbauer

Despite an onslaught of earnings warnings from tech  companies lately, the 
consensus expectation for Oracle (ORCL) is for  at least a penny earnings 
surprise and possibly a two-cent positive  surprise.

Bert Hochfeld at Josephthal & Co., one of the more accurate  analysts 
following Oracle, is one of two analysts that have an official earnings  
estimate of $0.11 per share. Mr. Hochfeld told clients recently that the 
company  would meet his expectations with strong U.S. sales offset by 
disappointing  European sales.?

The consensus among the 28 analysts is for Oracle  to earn $0.10 per share on 
revenue of just under $2.7 billion, yet even the more  conservative analysts 
are optimistic. Gretchen Teagarden at Salomon Smith Barney  is one of the few 
analysts with an estimate below $0.10 per share, but her  revenue estimate is 
slightly above the consensus revenue estimate.

On  Tuesday Chris Shilakes at Merrill Lynch told clients that he is 
projecting  earnings of $0.10 per share on revenue of $2.68 billion. However, 
he added that  revenue might be slightly better than his projections and 
Oracle's continued  improvement with operating margins should lead to 
earnings of $0.11 to $0.12 per  share.?

Last week Jim Pickrel at Chase H & Q told clients that  he expects the 
company to meet or beat his earnings estimate of $0.10 per share  and revenue 
estimate of $2.6 billion. He stated that Oracle's ""pipeline appears  robust"" 
and that the company should achieve 52% revenue growth or better in its  
applications business.

The pressing issues regarding Oracle among the  analysts are next quarter and 
the recent management turnover. Mr. Pickrel stated  Oracle's Senior Vice 
President Gary Bloom's departure would not have much of an  impact, but 
turnover in other key management positions is an issue. Yet, the  recent pact 
with CitiGroup (C) adds some  confidence in the current team. Richard Davis 
at Needham & Co. told clients  recently that this quarter would be fine but 
still downgraded Oracle's stock  because of the departure of Bloom and Senior 
Vice President Ray Lane reduces the  company's earnings visibility and may 
encourage others to leave the company as  well.

Mr. Upin said that Oracle could have a tough February quarter and  could see 
its toughest test of its performance in the applications space in the  May 
quarter. Yet, overall the analysts like the stock and believe the recent  
stock price is a buying opportunity.?

As result, the company will  need to at least meet or beat the $0.11 Earnings 
Whisper number and provide the  analysts comfort with the current management 
team and the upcoming quarters. If  this can be accomplished during the 
conference call on Thursday, some analysts  believe the stock could reach $35 
in the very near term. You may listen to  Oracle's conference call at 
http://www.nasdaq.com/reference/broadcast_oracle.htm  beginning at 5:30 PM ET 
on Thursday.

2285,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

2289,"Netiquette.  What's that?  

Well, in case you didn't know, Netiquette is the proper use of e-mail.  
Because we all spend a large portion of our day communicating with customers, 
vendors and co-workers via e-mail, here are some tips to help you polish your 
e-mail skills and send you on your way to Netiquette success. 

Short & Sweet
Keep your messages concise and to the point.

Cluless In . . .
The subject line can be a couple of words or a short phrase that gives the 
reader a hint to the contents of your message.

ARE YOU ANGRY?
The use of UPPERCASE text is the equivalent of yelling in the world of 
e-mail.  Lower the case and, thus, your e-mail voice.

Are You Still Angry!!!??
Watch out for excessive punctuation like exclamation points.  If something is 
important, put it in words, not exclamation points.

We Can Become Too Attached
Think of your reader and, whenever possible, put your message in the body of 
the e-mail rather than in an attachment.

Does Everyone Need To Know?
Be careful when you send replies to ""all recipients"" of an e-mail.  Ask 
yourself if everyone really needs to see your response.  If not, you'll be 
using up disk space, cluttering inboxes and slowing the mail servers 
unnecessarily.

Spellcheck Is Your Friend
Like printed documents, e-mail deserves a review to assure that grammar and 
spelling are correct.

Privacy On The Net?
There is no such thing as private e-mail.  Never send anything by e-mail that 
you would not want to see on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper.  There 
are no security guarantees with electronic mail.

Eyes Only In Cyberspace
Avoid sending any confidential or sensitive information via e-mail.  
Remember, it's very easy for someone else to forward messages you considered 
confidential.  Even messages sent as ""Confidential"" can be copied.

Quick Tips -- Refine Your Skills
Long paragraphs are hard to read.  Break them up into smaller ones of two to 
three sentences.
The use of abbreviations should be minimal.
When sending e-mail outside Enron, keep it plain and simple.  That means no 
elaborate use of formatting tools, such as bold, indent, etc.
Your e-mail signature should be the same one you use on printed documents.
Address people in business e-mail the same way you normally would in person 
or in a letter (e.g., Bob: or Ms. Smith:)
Sarcasm is dangerous to use in e-mail.  Remember, e-mail does not convey 
emotions.",Netiquette Bob Smith,,Enron

Top Gas Gorillas Show Strong Volume Growth
The year 2000 was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing, with 
huge increases in gas prices, enormous volatility, continuing growth in sales 
volumes and major potential for profits. Physical gas sales volumes for the 
top 20 marketers in NGI's ranking grew 17% to nearly 150 Bcf/d, and profits 
among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as Williams 
reporting 2,000% profit increases in their energy merchant segments. 
However, for many of the smaller players it was a tough year. ""The big news 
here is probably the price pressure the marketers have had to withstand,"" 
said Ben Schlesinger, president of Maryland-based consulting firm Schlesinger 
and Associates, which tracks energy marketing. ""These people have price 
exposure on both sides of their business: the buy side and sell side. They've 
actively sought to hedge these risks, but there's no question that there have 
been some real stresses in their businesses as a result of quadrupling gas 
prices in 2000."" 
Significant shuffling has begun to take place and will continue, not just 
among the leadership but among the whole roster of 500 marketing companies, 
predicted Schlesinger. ""For the first time I'm not sure all 500 will make it 
because of the price volatility, and the stresses that it creates on their 
balance sheets and their ability to meet the different needs of their 
customers."" If you are on the wrong side of a transaction these days in 
California, you are going to suffer significantly. It's not much different at 
the Henry Hub either, he noted. The harsh reality is that only the strong 
will survive. 
Ronald J. Barone of UBS Warburg believes the California energy crisis and 
fears of lack of gas supply and capacity are driving customers to the 
strongest marketers. ""I think that over the long term it will be a positive 
for the bigger players, such as Enron. Customers want to go with somebody who 
is big, has facilities, somebody who is going to guarantee it, somebody who 
can do risk management for them. Enron is the 800-pound gorilla here."" 
Enron has been the 800-pound gorilla in gas marketing for years but there 
were always plenty of 750-pound gorillas around. Last year, however, Enron 
found a way to trade natural gas over the Internet and at last glance was 
well over 1,600 pounds, more than double the size of its next closest rival 
gorilla, Duke Energy. Enron sold 23.8 Bcf/d of gas last year compared to only 
13.3 Bcf/d the year prior and compared to the 11.9 Bcf/d sold by Duke Energy, 
which came in second place in NGI's ranking of gas marketers by physical 
sales volume. 
Enron catapulted itself to the next level with the help of its handy new 
tool, EnronOnline, its web-based proprietary energy and commodity trading 
system that now handles about 3,000 mainly natural gas transactions each day. 
In 2000, Enron completed its first full year of deploying EnronOnline, which 
quickly became the world's largest web-based e-commerce site. During the 
year, Enron executed 548,000 transactions online with 3,000 customers, 
totaling $336 billion of gross value. 
The tremendous success of EnronOnline led many observers to wonder whether 
market concentration was beginning to take place in the industry. When you 
look at Enron's massive increase in wholesale transactions you have to wonder 
about that concentration. Enron's 23.8 Bcf/d is pretty large (35%) when 
compared with the 69 Bcf/d that is actually consumed in North America. But 
you have to factor in multiple trades ","Williams

The Rofr option, which grants the shipper the right to lock in the 
transportation rate (max rate) for next
a few years, is priced as a spread swaption. 

I priced two scenarios for you:  the strip starts 1) Nov.1-00 and 2)Nov. 1-01.
For the first one I assume that the shipper makes decision on Oct. 31,00 (54 
days  to maturity)
and  on Oct. 31,01(419 days to maturity)  for the second case.

The second case has longer time to expiration, therefore larger option time 
value. See the attached
spreadsheets for more detail.

2315,"El Paso Says It's Open to Expansion of System
El Paso Natural Gas ""is willing to expand its system"" to the California 
border if ""sufficient support"" for such a project can be demonstrated through 
long-term capacity contracts, the pipeline told FERC. 
The pipeline's comments were in response to a Commission inquiry asking El 
Paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed Line 2000 
crude-oil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline 
capacity crunch in the West.  Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of 
Energy Projects, raised the prospect in a Jan. 3 letter to El Paso, saying 
that modifying the project ""could assist the difficult situation"" now facing 
the California gas market. 
Specifically, the Commission has recommended that El Paso amend a pending 
application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 
1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and 
convert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends 
from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service 
a 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line 
2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a 
system expansion. 
However, ""there are several ways that an expansion could be accomplished,"" 
wrote El Paso Vice President Al Clark on Jan. 15. ""El Paso could add 
compression to the proposed Line 2000 project, or it could replace or 
recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon 
in place."" As a third option, he said El Paso could add new compression to 
its existing system or loop either the existing system or Line 2000 project. 
The ""preferable method will have to be determined by a careful analysis of 
the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity, 
i.e. where they want to put gas into El Paso's system and where they want the 
gas delivered,"" Clark said. 
As a ""first step"" towards gauging market support for an expansion, he noted 
that El Paso on Jan. 12 posted 1.2 Bcf/d of California-bound pipeline 
capacity for sale effective June 1 of this year. The capacity currently is 
held by affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy, whose contracts expire May 31. 
When the posting results are known, ""El Paso will determine whether another 
open season is needed to solicit expressions of interest in additional 
pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of California."" 
If El Paso finds there is an ""unmet demand for additional capacity"" on its 
system, the pipeline at that time ""will evaluate whether an expansion of the 
existing system or a modification of the Line 2000 project, or both, is the 
appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion,"" Clark noted. 
In the meantime, he urged the Commission to approve El Paso's application for 
the Line 2000 project as it was filed. Not only will the project ""increase 
the operational flexibility"" of El Paso's current system, but converting the 
line from oil to gas service will be a ""necessary prerequisite"" to any future 
expansion of the pipeline's system, according to Clark.

With that review, it was decided by our management since we are  not as well established in California as other areas, it would be best not to  send in any  bid at this time.

Given today's e-mail traffic, I would like to invite everyone to attend next
month's EMCA meeting.  We will be talking about major projects that we may
want to undertake in the coming year.  I went to the PIP meeting last week
and we discussed the the process involved for setting up an official
citizen's patrol in our neighborhood.  If we, as a group, decide this is
necessary, then we can work with the Storefront to get rained and then the
police will provide us with all of the official signs to post on streets and
patrol cars.  They said  that crime normally shows a significant decrease in
neighborhoods that have taken on the responsibility of a patrol.  Also, my
husband, Bruce Hastings, has volunteered to be the PIP representative this
year, so he will be interested in tracking these trends.

I hope that everyone will try to come on the February 19th for the discussion
of what we want to put on our plate for next year.

See you there!

One important requirement under that transaction is that Enron Operations Services Company has agreed to continue providing certain services to Northern consistent with our past operations.  Northern will be billed for those services, and we will be required to demonstrate the basis for those billings.  

Effective, Feb. 1, all employees in the ETS family of companies that perform any services for Northern or related to Northern's operations in any way should keep timesheets documenting the amount of time spent on Northern projects or supporting personnel and activities related to Northern projects.  

If there are any questions about this requirement, please communicate with your department head or with me.  Thanks for your help in implementing this important requirement.

I am passing along the following changes to all three (3) of the letter
agreements:

Section 3(g):  The addition of ""in ENA's possession"" should be deleted
from Section 3(g).  We were told that Exhibit T (or Exhibit B-2 in the
case of the ABB) was deleted from the Facility Agreement because the
documents had already been furnished to ENA.  If all these documents
have been furnished by GE (or ABB), then the addition of ""in ENA's
possession"" is not needed.  If all of these documents have not been
furnished by GE (or ABB), then the Facility Agreement should specify the
documents not yet furnished and bind GE to furnish those not yet
furnished, and in the letter agreement ENA should covenant to deliver
the specified documents which have been furnished.

Section 6(b):  Clause (iv) of Section 6(b) should be revised as
follows:

""(iv) following the date from the execution of the Facility Agreement
through the closing of the Transaction, neither ENA nor the LLC
will not have agreed to or issued agree to or issue any written election

2406,"Hi Carolyn,

Here are my intial comments on the letter agreement and LLC:

1.  Will there be a second set of documents for the LLC getting the 
transformer as well as the turbine?

2.  Tax liability - I think we should broaden the tax section to offload 
responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the 
equipment, not just the sale.  I believe this should be a TEH responsibility.

3.  Terminology - Breakout contract should be Facility Agreement, and 
commercial operations should be as defined in the Facility Agreement (a 
reference is fine).

4.  Confidentiality - any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the 
confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement?  If fact, please review 
the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss 
same.

5.  Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here.  We should 
specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity, or guaranteed 
by a credit worthy entity.  

6.  Timing of delivery of contract and funding -  in discussing this matter 
with our commercial lead, Ben Jacoby, he indicated that he believed that the 
obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility 
agreement, or stated another way, a condition precedent to the obligation to 
fund as opposed to existing (as a signed document) as of the time of signing.

7.  Reps - as we discussed, Enron should rep that it has the ability to 
convey the equipment, or other such language, as opposed to getting into the 
nitty gritty of our financing structure.

I'm still reviewing and collecting comments, but this gives you an idea of 
where we are headed.

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Pontiac TSS.  
Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission 
Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of 
receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the 
ComEd queue.  If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the 
ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C. 

Call me if you wish to discuss.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk

structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and

1. ENA Legal is responsible for deal documentation and legal sign off for the 
transaction, and is typically responsible for all transaction-related 
agreements documents such as MOUs/MOIs, Participation or Development 
Agreements, and any Agreement, which directs the operation of the project 
(O&M Agreement, Steam Agreement, Gas Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement, 
etc.).  

2. ENA Legal represents the interests of  advises the origination and 
development team (and other members of ENA management as appropriate) on all 
legal aspects of a transaction, accessing internal and external resources as 
required. and reviews/synthesizes comments from the all the groups.  

3. ENA Legal works with origination team, Accounting, Global Finance and Tax 
in structuring the transaction, and communicates with EECC (and others) as 
required during the execution of the project to faciliate compliance with the 
structure.


Recommendations for improving the interaction between EE&CC and ENA:
1. EE&CC Legal should be involved in the beginning of the process of drafting 
documents by EE&CC Contract Administration, unless other procedures have been 
agreed.  
2. Due to conflicts of interest, EE&CC Legal cannot represent NEPCO  while at 
the same time working with the deal team. to procure equipment for the same 
project. ENA Legal and EECC Legal should be advised early in the process of 
any project-related agreements being generated by EECC, so that compliance 
with overall deal structure and risk profile can be ascertained.
3. Comments returned to EE&CC  need to either be incorporated in the next 
draft, or if there are issues on the comments, they need to be discussed with 
the ENA Legal representative or Origination contact, prior to distribution to 
vendors.
4. EECC Legal and ENA Legal should communicate regarding issues common to 
both companies so that consistency in position can be achieved as much as 
possible.  Forms of ""standard"" agreements should be discussed/agreed to 
enhance consistency.
5. Service and consulting agreements not specific to a particular transaction 
which can be untilized by multiple Enron companies via tasking letters should 
be prepared by EECC.  EECC should provide information concerning the 
existence of such service agreements.
6.  ENA Legal would should work closely with EE&CC contract administrators in 
drafting equipment in the preparation of contracts which the contracts 
personnel have been tasked to prepare. EECC Legal can assist by providing 
input, but is not required by ENA to sign off on such contracts.",,,"ENA Legal ( TBD ENA Legal Power Purchase Agreement ENA Accounting, Global Finance EECC EE&CC Contract Administration NEPCO EECC Legal Enron"

We won't have any site specific technical info, so we will  have to fly 
without it.  I know that seems strange, but there is no designated site for 
this equipment as of now.

Here's co#1:



Each of these units has one dual fuel option.

The master list of serial numbers is in this document:




We use the unit serial numbers as opposed to turbine or generator serial 
numbers.  I'm sending you the whole enchilada since this is a handy reference.

I agree with adding 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option to the January 
payment.  Unit 17  to company 1 is fine.  The maximum liability price (or 
whatever we call it) will be the base price allocation, plus the dual fuel 
option amount.

Good question on the retention.  I guess we should set it up as if each is in 
a stand alone project. As far as I know they may be intending to put these at 
separate sites.

I just realized that this is at the same time as our GE conference call.  Can 
we adjust the time of the GE call?

I have a feeling that Roger's presentation is the generic mark-to-market

to the lease accounting rules and other stuff specific to Turbine Torture.  
Do you have any follow up questions from last week you want me to ask?

dropped the ball on that one, although I wish I had expedited them more.  I 
still haven't heard from Kent, despite email, voice mail, and calling Lee.  I 
hope he is ok, because being non-responsive is not Kent's style at all.

1. Advantages to the single contract:

Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one.
Better from a liability standpoint.
Easier to administer.

Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?

2. Repayment/prepayment

I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.

3.  Assignment to Mitsui

Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested 
payment within 3 days of executing the contract.  This means that the 
assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE 
contract.  I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence.  
Peggy is checking on this, also.

4. Parent guaranty.

GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.  From a quick review of the draft 
contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the 
current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment 
to a certain class of assignees.  If I am correct, then I suggest consider 
inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after 
execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if 
necessary.

Here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the European/Oslo  weather 
situation.  Mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to 
review it this week.  Personally, I think that this is the wrong answer from 
a Corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth 
any more of our time.  For what it is worth, I think our communication 
strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed 
to be.  These groups will be expected (and held accountable) for good and 
consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well.   For a P&L that is 
this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this.  There 
is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to 
bigger and better things.

I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the 
other issues and problems on my plate.  Let's discuss upon your return on our

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;

			 Split after 2Q

If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further

I am very interested in both the Signac and Cross.

A few  questions about the pieces.  You referenced Meier Graefe for ""Pan"" for 
both pieces.  I don't know what that means could you please clarify?  Also I 
don't understand the reference to an Album.  Is the Signac numbered?  Are 
either signed on the stone?

Thanks for the update.  I will not have an opportunity to talk with you right 
now.  I am in Tokyo and my next destination may change due to business events 
in the middle east.

I am very interested in acquiring Blue note, however,  I do want to know more 
about the price.  I was close to locating one via a gallery via ebay for a 
lot less.  Also, your price was $4,500 for the same piece framed.  Is there 
room on the price if I give you a firm commitment.  The ebay price is 
significantly discounted but they are not ready to close the deal yet 
either.  If you can't get them down on the price,  it is worth me chasing 
down the other option for a while.

Please let me know via email and I will attempt to be responsive via odd time 
zones.

Thanks,

Stan Horton has been invited to attend a series of meetings associated with  
INGAA in Tokyo.  I believe that Stan is the Chairman of INGAA.  There are 
some Tokyo companies that are a part of the organization.  Bill Smith, CEO of 
Sonat (now El Paso) and will be talking about LNG and Japanese requirements 
and will be going to Tokyo.  Stan has asked both Sherriff and me if this is 
worth his attendance.  I thought you would be the best answer to that.  I 
also told him that you could represent Enron very well in any meeting in 
Japan. 

Please call Stan at 713 853 6177 and discuss with him.  He can fill you in 
better on the details.  Your call.

2553,"Mike - I think we are doing a good job of isolating ourselves from the direct 
risk of owning synfuel machines.  The equity owners are the ones at risk for 
any amendments to Section 29 of the tax code.  Further, we have identified 
the ""Class A"" machines in the market, those with the strongest PLR 's, legal 
facts, and credit worthy owners, and have concentrated our activities on only 
those machines.
  
We will be responsible for supplying coal to the machines, a short position 
we enjoy today with our term sales of equity coal to Florida Powers' synfuel 
group and traded coal to Sempra, and act as sales agent (obviously with 
obligations to sell) for the resultant synfuel. The deals we are currently 
negotiating with AIG and PacifiCorp are even more favorable then our Sempra 
deal in that we will not be acting as operator of the machines.  We also 
expect to receive mark to market  accounting treatment on the new deals.  As 
point of reference we think AIG will be worth about $25 mm and PacifiCorp 
north of $50 mm.  Although we have yet to mtm the Sempra deal, it is worth 
about $25 mm on a mtm basis. 

Between the above three deals we have over $100 mm of potential income this 
year.  In addition we will enter into long term short positions with the 
machines, which will allow us to expand our physical flows, and continue to 
grow our business.  As an example, this year we will deliver about 12 - 15 mm 
tons of eastern coal.  If we successfully conclude the AIG and PacifiCorp 
deals, we will move an additional 11 - 13 mm tpy of eastern coal.  Sempra 
will add another 2 mm tpy, for a total of 13 - 15 mm tpy.  We will be in a 
position to virtually double our physical flows of eastern coal next year.

Synfuel has already had a significant impact on a number of regional markets. 
Not only do we want to be in the synfuel business, we need to be in the 
business in order to understand, anticipate, and take advantage of rapidly 
changing market dynamics.  Synfuel represents a significant, fundamental 
change in the coal business.  This changing market  will present new 
opportunities for us to develop and exploit.  The key obviously is to be a 
major player in both the synfuel and underlying coal markets in order to take 
advantage of the information flows generated by each market. 

We are already in the process of meeting with international customers about 
supplying them with synfuel.  We have received a favorable reaction from both 
the international utilities and steel mills.  We will gain a significant 
competitive advantage in the international market by being in a position to 
offer synfuel not only through Pier IX in Virginia (Sempra), but also through 
New Orleans (AIG and PacifiCorp - via terminal sites on the Ohio River 
system).

We have asked our regulatory people to stay on top of any activity in 
Washington, and to date synfuel has not been a significant political issue.  
Jordan has directed our outside tax people to monitor the IRS' temperature,  
and their response to any letters they receive regarding synfuel from members 
of Congress or the industry. The noise in the system has been primarily 
generated by Arch Coal Co. who are not active in the synfuel market; and the 
State of West Virginia, who would like to tax the production of synfuel. 

The tax issue is one we will try to solve by pushing back on the equity.

 Arch is no match for the combined legal and lobbying capabilities of the 
large players now in the synfuel business - Florida Power, SCANA, PGE, AIG, 
Sempra, PacifiCorp, Kentucky Utilities, TECO, Keystone Conemaugh, DQE, 
Norfolk Southern, Fannie Mae, Drummond, Peabody (Lehman Bros.), Alliance 
(Chase), Massey (Fluor) and Southern Company Services. In addition Aquila. 
PSE&G, Duke, CP&L, VEPCO, Santee Cooper and others are working to locate 
machines at their river terminal and generation sites.

I will be in Pittsburgh and West Virginia all of next week.  I would like to 
schedule a meeting time for the group, and I will call in - preferably Monday 
mid - afternoon or Tuesday late afternoon.  Angie will coordinate with 
everyone to set a convenient time.

Thanks,

2560,"trip last week was disappointing on several scores:

1) veba debt found out to be 13 million dollars.  both an operator within gm 
and veba themselves confirmed these numbers to different people
within enron.

2) gm starting to not supply customers.  they have been living hand to mouth 
and cash flows are reaching critically tight levels.   both q8 and totalfina 
have 
not been able to get gasoline from gm since thursday of last week.  the 
stocking 
out of gasoline is more to do with the fact that gm's term gasoline supplier, 
vitol, 
will only supply them gasoline if they pre-pay their entire months volume.
we are looking to step-in and work gasoline thru ectric as we do gasoil 
presently.  
that means that enron sells the product to ectric and ectric hold the product 
in tankage 
and allow gm to prepay as they can (usually payments of around 500,000 
usd).   

3) without my going there I wouldn't have a clue that they were in these 
difficulties.  
the office lacks a commercial person to manage the business.  don antonio, 73 
year 
head of the company, insists on all negotiations going through some 
consultants
he has hired.  these consultants know little about the market and don't seem 
to
grasp the seriousness of the situation.  the only positive thing I can say is 
that they
are trying to push ectric as the only way forward for gm in their present 
situation.
this is positive because I believe of all the creditors we will continue to 
get paid 
the most since without us the business will fold tomorrow.  reason for this 
is that we
are the holders of the strategic stock which is required to be an operator 
and are
providing through the ectric jv structure a way to keep the business going.

4) strategy going forward would be to continue on the same course of trying 
to get
as much money as we can back without getting any more involved.  this is 
problematic
given we are beginning the process of transferring gm's better credit 
customers to 
ectric and raising the profile of ectric in spain.  also very frustrating 
given the lack of
commercial management within gm at the moment.  

5) at the moment we are pressing them for a cash flow statement.  this 
situation looks
bad given their practise of factoring receiveables to the banks, outstanding 
debt (we
know of 20 million dollars between enron and veba)  they have no inventory of 
their own, 
and no credit lines to get supply.  on viewing this situation in spain I 
phoned london 
looking to get increased credit line to gm under a secured line that would 
enable them
to keep the business going.  steve young suggest that we take advantage of 
this situation
to also get at least half of our existing unsecured debt changed to secured 
debt.  the
consultants were sceptical that don antonio had personal cash that he could 
put up in
an escrow acct.  we stressed to them that collateral assets would take much 
longer to
value and register and therefore would not be an immediate remeady to their 
cash flow 
problem.  no guarantee that don antonio will meet these conditions but from 
our impressions
of things he doesn't have much choice at the moment.  would be revealing if 
he is unwilling
or unable to do so because I think that would reflect the present leveraged 
state of don 
antonio or a disbelief that they are going to make it through this difficult 
time.
think that we have a head start on the other creditors in understanding just 
how critical gm's 
present condition is and should do all we can to keep them going while we try 
to get our 
unsecured debt paid back.   

6) gm had approached us about 6 weeks ago to buy the company or a share of it.
given that we might be put in a position of looking at some assets as 
collateral for 
present unsecured debt do we want to get some people down there to evaluate 
the 
worth of the company?   if we were looking for countries where some retail 
business
was a worthwhile hassle spain would certainly make the list.   from a trading 
perspective
I still feel if we could turn this business around the shorts would be 
valuable to the london
gasoil and gasoline books.  greatest concern here is that presently that 
would require us
to run the business so gm don't bring very much to the jv.  the gm customer 
base has
a good payment history and gm have significant storage capacity in a country 
short of
this infrastructure.  hard to find any romance in this at the moment but if 
we going to have
to invest so much effort to get our money back anyway it might be worthwhile 
doing a
more detailed appraisal of gm.  not sure what the value of their retail 
gasoline sites,
transportation company, branded name within spain, etc is worth?  we might 
get greater 
transparency from them if they think we are interested in taking an equity 
stake.
at the moment their greater fear is on us walking away completely and so to 
date they
have always tried to give us the most optimistic scenario.  

7) to review the present course of action is to assign over to ectric the 
customer we are
ok with on credit and work on getting these customers to undertake supply 
contracts.  
subject to credit and senior management approval, we would like to help gm in 
the
present cash flow squeeze by establishing some type of rolling weekly credit 
line.
this would have to be backed by cash or some kind of collateral and at the 
same time
as that is established the same would have to be done for some percentage of 
our
present unsecured debt.   

8) we should prepare a plan for the worse-case scenario.

Hi Jon,
 
Thought I would send that e-mail to Beth but my  computer says the address you gave me is not a valid address.  Maybe you  could e-mail me the correct one.  Anyway seeing as I am interrupting your  work day I might as well carry on.  
 
I sure do worry about you two, living and working  in what is sure to be a hot spot for who knows what.  You don't think you  could talk Beth into moving to Canada.  I know we are not safe either but  Houston is so far away and maybe  we are just a little  safer.  I watched Oprah yesterday and she had people in the know  on  about the safety of the airlines.  Those people said it is not safe to fly  so how are we to return to normal?  It is going to take months to train air  marshalls.  Are you sure you are going to Florida for  Thanksgiving?   What are the thoughts for Christmas?  Think about  Calgary,
you could have dinner with the family, visit your  friends and maybe go skiing.  The bad thing is you have to fly here.   Anyway you can let me know.
 
I talk to Grandpa almost every day.  He is  having a hard time.  He is very lonely.  I talked to the nurse at the  hospital where my Mum is.  She had a bad spell and was threatening to  commit suicide.  A psychiatrist evaluated her and prescribed some  medication because she is so anxious.
He said he thought she had vascular dementia and  not alzheimers because she was able to answer questions.  They were  not all the right answers but he said, a person with alzheimers isn't  able to figure out that it was a question and therefore respond.  She did  have radiation treatment long ago on the back of her head for cancer.  I  always wondered if damage was done at that time.  I'm telling you this so  you don't feel so threatened by the disease in the family.   Your Dad  was laughing and said: "" Wouldn't it be scary if my Mum ended up being the  most with it of the folks ?""   I know life just gets more  depressing.  
 
I will send some pictures from Dad's birthday to  you soon.  I think we need to get a scanner and then it would be quicker  although I guess you go through a lot more cartridges when you print out  pictures.  Steve has gone to B.C. for his competition this weekend.   He doesn't have any aspirations of winning but says at least he did it.  He  got down to 155 lbs.  so made light weight.  I'm hoping he goes back  to real food but stays in shape.  
 
How is the squash game going?  Has Beth beat  you yet?  Are you still golfing?  We are pretty well done with   the golf but curling started Thursday.  Both Dad and Robert were away so  Joanne and I and two spares managed to get a win.  Joanne skipped and I  played second.  By the way, Joanne thinks she is moving to Toronto with  work.  She said probably Nov. 1st.  I guess Mirant bought the last of  Trans Canada Pipeline and so she and some marketing guy will  set up  the Toronto office.  I read in the paper that this makes Mirant only  second to the U.S. giant,  Enron.  Meanwhile Mirant was moving  into Eau Clair this weekend as they need more space.
 
I'm sorry I rambled on.   If you get  me the right address for Beth, I'll bug her next time.  Love to both of you  and please keep safe.
 
Love Mum     ",Jon Beth Oprah Mum Dad Steve Robert Joanne Mirant Eau Clair,,Trans Canada Pipeline Enron

2584,"Hey,

Houston is Hot hot hot..........So far the living arrangements are good, however, I remain cautious about the potential going forward.  The loft is very cool (i.e. trendy, not cool temperature), but I can hear the sucking sound on my bank account.  Its only been a couple of days, but so far so good.  My email address is the same and you can get a hold of me by sending me a note.

I think I may have sold my house, there is still a few thing to be worked out, but I'll let you know when I'm comin' back to Calgary so you can pick-up some of the kitchen stuff.

Jon

2605,"Group,

When doing an import or an export from California there are a few important 
guidelines to remember.

IMPORT-This must be FIRM.  A firm import is required so that we provide the 
spinning reserves to California (we do this by buying firm energy for the 
import).  If the import is non-firm, California will charge us their price 
for spinning reserve margins.  This could easily be $400 per mw come this 
summer.


EXPORT-This must be NON-FIRM.  A non-firm export allows us to provide 
spinning reserves to our bilat trading partners (or to simply sell the energy 
without spinning reserves as ""non-firm""), and NOT have to pay the California 
price for spinning reserve margins.  Conversely if we do a firm export, we 
would have to pay for California to supply spinning reserves.  And because 
California will sometime use actual purchased energy for spinning reserves, 
this could easily be $400 per mw this summer.
California has also proposed cutting firm exports this summer, so a ""firm"" 
export does not imply that the energy would actually be exported anymore than 
nonfirm.

IF you have other questions.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill",,400,"the

2695,"I spoke with Kent Harris at Wildhorse today and he stated there position to 
me on a few things.

1.  Our Interruptible noms to NWPL for Wed. were not cut due to contractual 
reasons, we were cut due to a lack of capacity.  He said that the San Arroyo 
#2 compressor was down and without it they cannot make additional deliveries 
to NWPL.  They hope to have it up by friday and will try to provide us some 
capacity into NWPL.

2.  Kent reiterated their position regarding our contract by stating that 
""the intent of the original contract was not to take gas through other 
systems other than the Mesa system"".  In addition he stated that we do not 
have the right to choose which pipeline our gas is delivered to.

3.  He also asked whether or not we were willing to negotiate on the current 
situation or if we wanted to let the 'lawyers fight it out"".  I reiterated 
that we have been waiting for them to either acknowledge that they will 
gather the entrada gas under the current contract or provide us with another 
alternative.  Absent either of those 2 things happening all we can do is try 
to live by the existing agreement.  He stated that they have new estimates on 
the cost to construct a new line through the South Canyon and it is 
approximately $1MM less than their original esitmate.

We left it that he would determine whether or not they would gather  the 
Entrada under the existing contract or make a new proposal that would most 
likely wrap the Entrada and Dakota up under one new deal and replace the 
existing contract.

I told him we would determine whether or not we wanted to ""let the lawyers 
fight over the existing contract"" or work on a new deal for all the 
production.

A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.
After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied,
""When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka
next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""  So next
Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon,
he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.  Upon his
return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:

1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy,  
Junior and the Spook.
8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, ""Take this
And eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me""
12. The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""
13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for
the grub, yeah God.
14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's,
not a peter pulling contest at! St. Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck to
everyone who passes it on. The one who breaks the chain will have bad
luck. Do not keep this letter. Do not send money. Just forward it to five of
your friends to whom you wish good luck and a great laugh.
You will see that something good happens to you four days from now if
the chain is not broken.

How to Explain Enron to Your Children:

Feudalism - You have two cows. Your lord takes some of
the milk.

Fascism - You have two cows. The government takes
both, hires you to
take care of them, and sells you the milk.

Communism - You have two cows. Your neighbors help
take care of them and
you share the milk.

Totalitarianism - You have two cows. The government
takes them both and
denies they ever existed and drafts you into the army.
 Milk is banned.

 Capitalism - You have two cows. You sell one and buy
a bull. Your herd
multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell the milk
and retire on the
income.

 Enron - You have two cows. You sell three of them to
your
publicly-listed company, using letters of credit
opened by your
brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity
swap with an
associated general offer so that you get all four cows
back, with a tax
exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six
cows are transferred
via an intermediary to a Cayman Islands partnership
secretly owned by
the CFO of the publicly listed company who sells the
rights to all seven
cows back to your listed company. The annual report
says the company
owns eight cows, with an option on one more, and that
these and certain
other cow-related activities give milk, both realized
and
unrealized/notional, at an annual run rate of 1.54
billion gallons

Dear Global Oil Retainer Client,

PIRA is expanding its weekly assessment of global refining profitability to
include Mediterranean and Singapore refining regions - key additions to
those already provided on a weekly basis, which include ""cracking"" for WTI
crude in the U.S. Gulf, Chicago and Group 3; ""cracking"" for LLS crude in the
U.S. Gulf; and ""cracking"" and ""hydroskimming"" for Brent crude in N.W.
Europe. These margins are based on PIRA's proprietary crude yields, and
represent industry or ""swing"" refinery margins. The added margins are
""cracking"" and ""hydroskimming"" for Urals crude in the Mediterranean, and
""cracking"" and ""topping"" margins for Dubai crude in Singapore.

The $/Bbl margins represent incremental cash operating margins, which equal
gross product worth, less delivered crude cost, less variable refining
operating costs. Margins are calculated and plotted for each day that prices
are available.

PIRA will continue to publish margin charts every Monday afternoon at
www.pira.com.

Look for further announcements in the future as PIRA continues to enhance
worldwide refining information for its Retainer Clients, including margin
analysis in other key refining regions.

Energy Company Values Sink
In Response to Changing Times=20

Constellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday i=
n response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' proje=

s ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a=
 minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone =
ahead.=20
Analysis:  Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level i=
n seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent s=
ince May 1, 2001.  But perhaps what is most important about Constellation i=

  Earlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold o=
ff on its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply =
Company, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until mar=

The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same for=
ces.  Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the=
 California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons f=
or dropping its company-separation plans.  The company said it would now fo=

te in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United=
 States.  ""What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that=
 comes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year=
) is the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for =
new power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound.  The world has chan=
ged,'' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a confere=
nce call with the media. =20
The change in Constellation's strategy will be costly.  The company will pa=
y Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agree=
ment, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $1=
96 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business cont=
inued.  Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will c=
ause the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth qua=

 Goldman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when=
 the investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the en=
ergy trading and marketing business.  In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take =
a 17.5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of =
Maryland deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a=
 separate trading company.  Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want =
to be part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain =
together.
It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other=
 significant announcements concerning its future plans.  Mayo A. Shattuck I=
II was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001.=
  Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche B=
anc. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for th=
e past seven years.  On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission sai=
d it would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generatin=
g station in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million.  Constella=
tion Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group.  As part of the s=
ale, Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at f=
ixed prices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license o=
f Nine Mile 1 is not extended.=20
The unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bul=
k of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny.  Constellation's domest=
ic merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per s=
hare of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher=
 than last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share =
in earnings for the same quarter.  Allegheny Energy reported that their thi=
rd-quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and t=
he acquisition of a trading and marketing unit.  Allegheny's third-quarter =
earnings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, =
and beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share.  Allegheny is c=
onfident that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3=
.80 to $4.10 per share.  =20
Despite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 pe=
rcent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days.  The drop =
in energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power pri=
ces.  Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Alleghen=
y's 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price=
 assumptions.  =20
The high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-e=
arnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be ov=
er.  Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for =
splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations=
 can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and softe=
ning wholesale market prices.  Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN A=
mro, said there are common themes affecting the industry:  ""One is lower po=
wer prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower =
stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth."" =20
AES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees.  Its earnings fell for a second c=
onsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain an=
d said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out =
selling off assets.  AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AE=
S was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term=
 contract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-ter=
m contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of f=
lat growth.  Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets we=
re very low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for thei=
r product.  But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer respons=
e to the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one=
 year ago in many parts of the country.  =20
The recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fu=
ndamental shift in the electric business.  Their actions are, in some respe=
cts, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliabi=
lity in their power supply costs, profits and operations.  Perhaps most sig=
nificantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to=
 whether or not they will continue to be an integrated business.  As Conste=
llation concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of busin=
ess is to remain an integrated company.  We would not be surprised if other=
s come to the same conclusion.  =20

i put in a transaction last week to kevin & via the website.
w/ kevin i requested goings/jamel white/cecil martin (1st available)
for dominic rhodes.
at website could only request goings for rhodes (which kiske snagged 1st).

someone needs to give us jamel white.  i tried to pick him up yesterday
and the site wouldn't let me.  if we still want to make any other waivers
this week is it possible?

2798,"This changes a long standing rule of being able to pick up those dropped on
Friday on a first come first serve basis - by doing this you will eliminate
better teams from ever picking up players - since on Monday it goes back to
reverse order etc.  Deluke do you concur. Why can't a message be posted on
Friday morning of all players dropped?

> ",Deluke,,
2799,"
I don't see the need to mix franchise and non-franchise on the first round.
We're trying to get less confusing - not more.  What we do not need is some
major change in the draft methodology 2 days before the draft.

The system that Kevin initially described is the fairest, least confusing
and works fine.  The franchise keepers (including me) should pick after
those that do not keep anyone.    It best simulates the outcome of a
non-franchise snake draft.  Assuming the franchise keepers retain picks 1
through 5 of  a true first round, they would naturally pick last in a
second round.  This system worked fine last year.

Dutch and Jeff have brought up ranking the franchise players instead of a
2nd random drawing for franchise keepers.  I would vote for that (even
though I would pick last in the 1st round - 28th pick!).  There are
questions with players that might have been injured part of the year or
otherwise, but at least you know exactly where you stand.

I believe in using the snake draft and a 2nd drawing for franchise keepers,
but I would be fine with ranking the franchise players based on prior year.

Jeff Smith is just whining because he kept (potentially) the 10th overall
player in Manning and would now potentially has Manning and the 28th pick.
This is a large sacrifice, but this is Jeff's fault not the system.  Look
at the other 4 franchise players - they are all in the top 5 in most draft
rankings.  Only Smith is complaining.

ent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Pa=
ckers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last=
 week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep i=

rday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien =
as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy s=
tarter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Team T-Bone Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status=

Since I'm using the website link to Outlook to send this e-mail, please let me know if you can't open the attachment and I will send it again when Outlook is back up in Omaha.  The order is about 163 pages in length so if you don't have a good copier and want a hardcopy please give either myself or Blair a call and we will provide it for you. 
 
Significantly for Transwestern is the section on Intrastate Transmission Capacity and the Open Season process.  This can be found on pages 41-58 with the Open Season discussion on pages 44 and 45.  On pages 126 and 140, the commission directs SoCal to include an additional 375mm/d of backbone (including receipt point) capacity in the open season process.  This is important because it includes the 50mm/d at Needles (per SoCal's exhibits in the system adequacy docket).  In the Comprehensive Settlement, Appendix B, North Needles is listed as having capacity of 750mm/d of Primary Access Rights from Transwestern.  It would be my recommendation that we need to encourage SoCal to revise this Appendix B as directed by the Commission to include the 50mm/d as capacity with Primary Access Rights from Transwestern as they had previously indicated in the Systems Adequacy Proceeding.  
 
SoCalGas was directed to file an Advice Letter to establish tariff revision to implement this order within 15 business  days of the effective date (December 11,2001).  Assuming two holidays for Christmas and New Years Day, this would make their filing date January 3, 2002.  If we all agree that we need to encourage SoCal to add the 50mm/d as part of the open season process, then this needs to be done prior to their Jan. 3rd filing.  Steve/Lorraine, please let me know if I can be of assistance.  Following their filing, interested parties have 20 days to file a protest and/or comments on an Advice Letter filing (January 23, 2002).
 
Please review the order or pertinent portions and advise of any comments you may have for our response.  I'll be in the office this week and on vacation between Christmas and New Years Day however I can be reached at home anytime.  My home number is (402) 330-3860.  gh

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

Reporting has been migrated to a new (it's own)  database server and 
access to the old server has been disabled to ensure the currency of data.

HOW THIS MIGHT AFFECT YOU:
If you use tools that link to the Report Settings database, the 'pipeline' DSN on your 
PC will need to be updated to point to the new server.  Specifically this applies to 
anyone utilizing a Access database to link to the database tables.


RESOLUTION:
We will be targeting known users (Justin's Group and Jay) tomorrow.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

Here's a version that reflects changes we discussed this afternoon. I've deleted the Energy Supply Option section from the Product Approval Template since the provision does not exist in the TC or Master Agreement.  A metering Special Term and Condition has been added to this draft.  The EESI section is now more broad regarding the quarterly billing adjustment.

I didn't add language to the ""Conversion to Fixed"" section yet.  I'm not sure how to word what you wanted...any suggestions?

I looked into the EPCRA reporting requirements for Sulfuric acid and lead in 
batteries. This is a one time report to the State's emergency planning 
committee, the local emergency response department, and the local fire 
department declaring the presence of sulfuric acid and lead in quantities 
greater than 500 lb and 10,000 lb, respectively.  These notifications are 
being mailed out today. I have not had a chance to do a detailed calculation 
of the amounts. I will do an analysis over the next few months to determine 
if we are required to also annually report by March 1st every year.

Dave will answer the first two issues below.

Thanks.

We are continuing to have difficulties accessing data from DealBench.  The
response times from PECO, PricewaterhouseCoopers and other high speed
internet connections have been very slow (sometimes 5 minutes or more to
retrieve a single 10-15 page text document).  It would help us greatly in
our due diligence efforts if this material could be made available on CD

2876,"Ben:  

Here are my answers to the Allegheny Questions below.  Please confirm the 
details with Dave Kellermeyer where necessary.

Question 1:   Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the 
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy. If 
not,    please explain status.

Answer:  I believe that the application for the Title V Operating Permit for 
the Lincoln Energy Center was submitted to the IEPA in the Spring of 2000.  
Dave   Kellermeyer can definitively answer whether this Operating Permit has 
been issued/received from the IEPA.

Question 2: Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility 
and, if so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by 
future   expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear, 
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.

Answer:  The ENSR Wetlands Delineation activities conducted during the period 
of December 1998 through February 1999 determined the following:
   1.  No wetlands existed on the 50 acre parcel upon which the Lincoln 
Energy Center was ultimately constructed.
   2.  An agricultural wetland area existed within the parcel of land 
adjacent to the western boundary of the Lincoln Energy Center 50 acre    
parcel.
   3.  After reviewing the ENSR wetland delineation information, the Will 
County NRCS confirmed the existence and boundary location of the    
agricultural wetland and  concurred with the ENSR conclusion that the 
agricultural wetland boundary was completely contained within the    parcel 
of land adjacent to the western boundary of the Lincoln Energy Center 50 acre 
parcel.

With regard to wetlands impacted during construction of the Facility, the 
construction of the Facility's natural gas pipeline lateral was routed 
through several existing wetland areas.  The potential impact of this 
lateral's construction on existing wetlands was mitigated through a 
directional drilling program implemented during the pipeline construction 
activity.  The Site Development permits required for this pipeline 
construction activity were obtained from the Will County Land Use 
Department.  

With regard to future Facility expansion plans, no impact to wetlands is 
expected provided that such expansion occurs within the existing boundaries 
of the 50 acre Facility parcel.

As a note to Question 2 above, I could not locate a reference to a 30 acre 
parcel within the ENSR Wetland Investigation Report described as 02.03.09C.  
Perhaps this is a typo and should be 50 acres.

Call/see me to discuss this information.  I will be in the office tomorrow 
(10/24) until 2 pm and then in Chicago on Wed-Thursday.  I will access my 
email via laptop while I am out of the office.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

hurry to buy, the summer should give
you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that 
the problem will come and go 
for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the 
situation.  I have no idea what 
they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.

What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are 
at their highest level in the last 
decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the 
market -  who would've thought 
San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are 
also a lot of intangibles associated 
with home ownership as your aware of.   

I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast

the West, I believe the issues to be resolved by WIO may be very important.  
Accordingly, I have argued in-house (to anyone who will listen) that we 
should be arguing that WIO should be independent.  I don't believe that it is 
independent, it's a stakeholder board, like California and the WSCC, both of 
which we have had problems with. 

Historically, a number of people have worked on WIO.  Tom worked on it for a 
while.  Recently, I think Marcie Milner has been monitoring the meetings.  I 
think Steve Walton and DIck Ingersoll may also be following WIO to some 
degree.  Also Jim has suggested to Alan that he might want to be following 
""seams"" issues.  A while ago Marcie asked me to review the governance

2951,"Greg stopped by to say that  the in the aftermath of the BPA/Kaiser non-deal 
the following further sub-deals could materialize.

Kaiser already has exercised a 24 hour notice right to sell balance of the 
month energy to BPA at index.  If BPA does not want the index power 
(unlikely) we could buy it from BPA.  No prepay strings.

Kaiser may give BPA 48 hour notice to do a January remarketing deal at an 
unknown price.  I'm not sure if we would purchase the power from BPA.  

Kaiser may give BPA a seven day notice to do a five month deal beginning in 
February which we might consider doing a prepay for.

Alcoa and another company are trying to close a deal by the end of the year 
whereby they are going to purchase a power plant-industrial complex at 
Longview, Washington. (Our origination guys are always working on something 
at Longview and this is probably it.)  As part of the closing, they are going 
to want to shut down part of the site and sell the power on the forward 
market.  There is a  potential that we might buy the power from them through 
BPA and perhaps prepay for it.

I told Greg the legal team, having worked through many of the issues on this 
kind of transaction last week, would stand by to help with any further 
developments. ",Greg,,BPA/Kaiser Kaiser BPA

2970,"Thanks, Guy.  Your point is valid; however, you are right that we don't want to emphasize the intra-day hourly part in this pleading since a firm power contract is necessary in order to have firm network service (hourly traders purchasing system contigent or unit contingent during the day would be scheduling the network transmission utilizing ""non-designated resource"", which makes the transmission less firm (right above non-firm PTP)).  ComEd's draft response also discusses this in the context that they are following the tariff.  The point we need to make is that the designation of firm LD contracts absolutely meets FERC's network resource requirements.

We have added an argument that, yet again, even having this type of issue with network, PTP, etc. emphasizes the need to move quickly to the market design that we advocate in the context of an RTO, which would eliminate these parochial issues (and without an icap obligation that Dynegy clearly wants.)

2.	El Paso - I just sent an e-mail summarizing the netting situation.  If the netting was proper then our only grounds for drawing is failure to renew the LC.  We sent them a letter yesterday about this.  Credit was going to contact them.  We can draw as early as next Wednesday.

3.	Great Bay - same as El Paso absent the netting issue.

4.	LG&E Energy Marketing - they owe us  a payment next Wednesday.  We will wait to see if they have paid and if they haven't we can declare them in default and draw.  If they have, we can draw based on a failure to renew the LC.


5.	Enserco - I will draft for Monica a follow up letter to send to them.  Credit will begin calculating Exposure/termination Amounts in anticipation of a termination as of Thursday, December 27th.  The letter today will give them until Wednesday to renew.

Each of Great Bay, El Paso Electric and LG&E Power have issued LC's to us that have has a drawing condition the fact that they have failed to provide alternate security and less than 20 days are left before expiration.  Another drawing condition is that a ""default"" has occurred under the EEI.

The LG&E and the Great Bay EEI master have a default that occurs if a party fails to establish, maintain, extend or increase Performance Assurance when required pursuant to the Agreement.  The definition of Letter of Credit in each Master does NOT have language to the effect that it has to be acceptable to us.

In the El Paso Master the default is based  on a party's failure to meet the collateral requirements in Article 8.  In that Master, the LC must be acceptable to us.


Do you think that we can argue that the failure to renew the LC is a ""default"" that would permit us to terminate and draw?

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Having navigated client investments through  previous wars and shocks to the economy, I will discuss the state of the economy  and asset allocation techniques for your investments in this precarious  time.  Other topics discussed :  retirement planning under the new tax  act and determining your risk tolerance.

Here is a summary of comments I have not yet incorporated:

1.	Fritz raised the point that if Fixed Independent Amount is selected then both parties could be posting collateral.  If this occurs, he thinks that only Sections 6, 7 and 9 should apply but that Sections 3 and 4 should not.

2.	In clause (b) of the definition of Exposure, should we add language at the end that says:  ""when such sum is a positive value, and when such sum is a negative value it represents, conversely, Exposure of Party Y to Party X.

3.	Fritz wanted to eliminate the ""demand"" requirement in Section 4 and make collateral posting automatic.

4.	Should we eliminate the consent requirement in the last sentence of Section 5(a) (reducing LC's)?

5.	Reliant wanted to delete the ""mid point"" language in the definition of Current mark to Market value.

6.	Reliant wants to add to Section 6(b)(iii) the phrase ""Secured Party notifies the Pledging party as to the"" after the 1 and 5 day triggers such that the delivery requirement begins after notice.

7.	Reliant wants to extend the time frames in Section 8. 	

8.	AEP wants to limit the definition of Credit Rating Event to a ratings drop only.

9.	  AEP wants to add language to the definition of Letter of Credit that requires it to be acceptable to the Secured Party.

I will forward to you PacifiCorp's and Duke's comments as I found most of them to be problematic.

To my knowledge there are a variety of prepay forms of transactions.  
1.  Some older forms were physically based (I think primarily with respect to gas and with Chase).  Teresa Bushman and/or Dan Lyons worked on these transactions).  
2.  Newer forms are triangulated swaps.  There are a series with Citibank, related to credit link notes (see Gareth Bahlmann re link notes), known as Yosemite/Delta Transactions.  There are 4 in the series (4th series had three prepays, US, Sterling and Euro).  The 5th did not close.  
3.  There is at least one other with Citibank, dated June 2001 and it is being wrapped into the pipeline credit facility and will be extinguished via the placement of the pipeline facility.  
4.  I am aware of one other (via the London office) which was extended September 2001, among Credit Suisse First Boston and ENA and Barclays.  

I suggest you contact Lisa Bills, Joe Deffner and Dan Boyle to determine a complete list.  I believe that this detail may have been determined by one of the teams formed last week.  You may wish to check with Haedicke.
In respect of accounting treatment, and book treatment, I suggest the following names:  Alan Quaintance, Clint Walden re accounting.  Dan Boyle has a name of someone who worked on placing the Delta transactions in the risk books, but I cannot remember the name.

3015,"Re:  Dealing with today's uncertain business climate:  How using LRSolutions will help your legal department reduce outside counsel fees, increase legal knowledge and expertise in-house and save countless hours of time for busy in-house attorneys

As you are well aware, legal research and related knowledge activities and products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise. In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas.  With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis.  Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis.

Traditionally, corporate counsel respond by utilizing outside law firms for many research and writing projects that could have been done internally if only they possessed the knowledge, resources, and time.  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of ""reinventing the wheel"", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to the enormous costs for corporate counsel.  Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive.  With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.  At the same time, associates are likely to miss subtle nuances in the law that can be damaging to the client.  In today's economy, it is absolutely essential for companies to reduce outside legal costs while retaining qu!
al!
ity and value.  In addition to saving costs, companies must be able to effectively manage risk in a proactive fashion, in order to avoid potential disaster.

LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and quality. Experienced, in-house, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.  LRSolutions' attorneys truly enjoy doing research, and analyzing complex legal issues.  In addition, we work with our network of legal experts that include hundreds of the nation's premier law professors and other distinguished attorneys organized intuitively into areas of specialty. Only experts in the field can produce a product in the most efficient manner, without
missing crucial issues and predict ultimate cost.  Now, for a predetermined, fixed price, you can combine legal expertise with enormous cost savings.  Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com.

Our products and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials such as appellate briefs and court filings, regulatory handbooks and manuals in every conceivable area of law (enabling your company to better manage risk and raise legal awareness), contract and other document drafting, settlement packages, and listings of relevant authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and objective that best suits your needs.  We can work with your outside counsel as part of your overall legal team, or provide an alternative to utilization of outside counsel as well as support for in-house projects.

If you would like to contact me by phone, please feel free to call at 1-800-627-8047, ext. 1.  Again, our website is http://www.lrsolutions.com.  Please also feel free to reply via email as well.

It has become clear that we cannot save ourselves, and so, a takeover would seem to be better than bankruptcy.  Through thick fog it seems that Wall Street banks (lenders to Enron) may favor a Dynegy takeover to the alternative,  and  the Moody downgrade fell just short of the junk bond line.  Tim Belden and Chris Calger flying to Houston means Portland's voice may be heard at one of the many tables in the many board rooms, but is offset by the fact that Tracy Ngo was seen in the photocopy room, rushing to get six months of expense reports submitted to Houston for payout.  

And, the crows were seen swarming out over the calm waters of the river, circling above the waters as if expecting to see something below, eventually rising up in a flock to lead the way south ahead of Tim and Chris.

I'm sorry if this wasn't clear.  I actually work with Christi and Susan (they both sit right behind me).  We have looked at all the regulatory issues, and have collected the majority of the necessary data to move forward.  At this point, I am working with Leslie Reeves and Ed Sacks to nail down some of the financial details.  After that, we just need to get Kevin Presto to sign everything and submit the application/registration.

However, before we do so, I assumed and Ed Sacks confirmed that we will need a legal review of those documents.  This does not mean reviewing the industry issues that Christi and Susan might do, but reviewing all the contractual provisions to ensure we are not entering into anything we find unfair, onerous, or contrary to our established procedures for such contracts.  

Again, my apologies for not making this more clear in my letter to Elizabeth..

Hall Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Monday, November 12, 2001:   +3

A number of relatively positive factors are offset by the single negative factor that the good old days are forever gone. The free fall seems to have ended.   Lots of cash is coming in.  Portland office is apparently to be spared a misery that  Houston will not be so fortunate as to escape,  and is given a clear message to resume work as usual.  Street Oracle  carping and whining at low level of hysteria.   

Perhaps a key subliminal message can be divined from the fact that Tim went to Houston carrying  full documentation and prepared to hand in all of his expense reports, but came back without having turned anything in at all,   flying back home on the jetstream,  much like the single crow that sailed by today,  heading due north high above the center of the Willamette, as though it knew exactly where it was going.

Following Monday's meeting, I would like to confirm the meeting dates that  we discussed for 4 future Contract Group activities:
 
December 6, 2001.  - Executive/Drafting Committee  - Discuss RTO Products.WSPP, Canadian Update. 
 
Mitch Dutton has confirmed that the Executive/Drafting Committee can meet  in AEP's offices in Columbus, 28th floor Conference Room. Let's start at  10:30 unless we find that your planes get in much earlier.
  
Mitch will provide address, transportation information from the airport and  building access information (as well as Columbus' best lunchl).  
 
Please RSVP to Cynthia Trueheart, Ed's assistant, (202) 508 5619 (or  by replying to this message) and include your arrival and departure times so we  can set precise meeting times. 
 
February 5 or 7, 2002.- Working Group meeting to  present the Collateral Annex, and other pending issues 
 
EEI's Offices have space for up to 100 people.  Do you have any  preference for February 5 (Tuesday) or 7 (Thursday)? Let Cynthia know.
 
May 2, 2002.  Training Seminar in conjunction with  EEI Legal Conference.  Bishops' Lodge, Santa Fe. NM.  
 
The Legal Conference begins with a reception Wednesday evening, May 1 and  continues through Saturday, May 4.  We would devote the first full day, May  2, to Contract issues, including a Trading Basics review and more in-depth  discussion of the Collateral Annex, new RTO Products and a Canadian annex.   While rooms at Bishop's Lodge are limited, we are looking into nearby hotels for  additional rooms. 
 
June 3 or 4, 2002.  Executive/Drafting Committee  meets during EEI Convention.
 
The EEI Convention takes place Sunday June 2 thru Tuesday June 4 at the  Boston Marriorr Copley Place Hotel.  the Convention is open to the public,  includes many interesting presentatons, a large trade show and a very nice party  on the last night.  EEI also conducts members-only business meetings in  between conventino events.  It attracts over 1000 people.  
 
We can easily meet there. I will most likely have the most free time on  Tuesday, June 4, but will confirm that shortly.
 
Canadian Issues.  Hans  Konow, President of the Canadian Electric Association, is very interested in  participating in the development of a Canadian Annex to the EEI  Contract.  CEA is usually ery easy to work with and would play the same role as EEI and  NEMA did in the initial stages - bring together interested parties and serve as  a neutral.  I expect to hear back from his staff soon.

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.

subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:

               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll

Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call

""Material Adverse Change"" means (i) with respect to [Enron Trading Entity], Enron Corp. (or its successor or its successor's parent company) shall have long-term, senior, unsecured debt not supported by third party credit enhancement that is rated by S&P below ""BBB-"" [also insert Moody's as appropriate];

I understood yesterday that we may also need to consider changing the definition of Credit Support Provider in the ISDA's. I suspect that if ""Credit Support Provider"" is defined as Enron Corp. in the relevant Master, then the corresponding changes noted above would also need to be made. Your further thoughts regarding this issue are welcomed.

3086,"EEI has been participating in discussion with FASB concerning the application 
of SFAS 133 and 138 to utility power purchase agreements where power is 
obtained to serve load obligations, as opposed to power marketing.  EEI's 
position is that such contracts should be treated under the  normal purchase 
and normal sale contracts exception under SFAS 138, for which derivatives 
accounting treatment would not apply.   Occaisonally a utility may agree to 
bookout certain transactions.  EEI's position is that a bookout is not a net 
settlement of the underlying purchase and sale contract because every party 
must fulfill each and every contractual transaction.  EEI also has maintains 
that even if there is a bookout title passes under the terms of the 
underlying contract.  See attached letter to FASB.

FASB has asked for additional information on the bookout issue.  In 
particular, it wants more information on the passing of title between 
entities in a bookout chain; what are the legal requirements for title to 
pass to another entity in a bookout chain?

FASB also wants to know whether under bookouts are cash payments always 
settled gross with each company paying the total contract price for the 
purchase involved and receiving the total contract price for its sale or are 
there exceptions in normal practice?  I assume settlment in gross does not 
occur in the case of a buyer and seller in the chain whose underlying 
contract(s) provide for payment and/or transaction netting.

The close of the comment period is on Friday, so we are trying to get a 
letter back to FASB asap.   I would appreciate it if anyone in our group 
could comment on the questions FASB asks and/or the letter we previously sent 
to FASB.  Thanks in advance.

As punishment for ignoring its pleas for price controls, last week the CPUC 
issued an order requiring the California IOUs to develop market-based rate 
tariffs for their Federal customers, e.g., military installations, federal 
agencies.  The CPUC thinks that by exposing the Federal government to current 
market prices it will cause Bush/Cheney to rethink price caps.  In any case, 
while I think this proposal is unconstitutional under the principles of the 
McCulloch v. Maryland case (states can't tax the federal gov.), I also think 
there might be a business opportunity here for EPMI in helping Federal 
enclaves lock in a fixed price for electricity.  In other words, offer these 
Federal entities a fixed-for-floating deal.  

Stewart Rosman suggested that the best way to handle this would be to offer 
the Federal entities a purely financial deal.  The Federal entities would 
continue to receive physical delivery from their utility but could lock in a 
fixed rate through a financial swap.

Before we get too far down the road on this, what are your thoughts?  Can the 
Federal gov., besides the U.S. Treasury, enter into derivatives contracts?  
While financial deals would appear to be superior because they involve less 
ongoing work (no physical scheduling or real time support), are there 
benefits to a physical transaction?  Any other ideas?

3108,"Elizabeth -- Three comments to consider:

In the first change, I think that I understand your change, but my impression 
was that ""provided for in this Confirmation"" was referring or tieing 
specifically to the ""deal"" defined in the Confirmation, therefore the change 
to say ""may be agreed to"" seems to weaken that reference.

On the 10th line, does adding the word ""firm"" in front of energy potentially 
conflict with the specific transaction if it is something more or something 
different than a simple firm deal.  Shouldn't the level of firmness be fully 
defined elsewhere in the confirm.

In (b), suggest adding some reference to quantity after your reference to 
timing along these lines:  "" (b)  the starting and ending time and date, and 
the quantity of the release or interruption;""     Since partial quantity 
releases are possible/likely, probably even successive releases (due to 
gradual weather changes)  it would be equally as important to identify 
quantity and timing.  Example:  start with 200 MW for the month, release 50 
MW starting day 10 for balance of month, then another 50 MW over a weekend.

As always, thanks for your assistance. -- David

The Supplementary Agreement looks fine.  There needs to be a few changes made 
to the cover sheet with respect to the MAC provision (debt rating) and the 
financial reporting for Party B (AEPSC).  AEPSC does not provide its own 
financials and is not rated.  So, the MAC and financial reporting 
requirements are only required for the 9 utilities.

AEPSC is only on the hook for third-party cross-default along with the 9 
utilities.

I'm sorry that I missed you today...got bogged down with other emergencies.  
But we can always wait for the cp's response and amend the above, unless you 
want to send another version.

3118,"As feared, the judge denied our motion to compel arbitration.  Liz said the
judge had read all the pleadings and the cases, and he seemed prepared to
rule before argument.  After listening to argument, the judge denied the
motion to compel arbitration because

--  12 other adversaries are pending dealing with similar issues
--  arbitration would interfere with efficient administration of the estate
--  a Discovery Mediator has been appointed to supervise cases
--  not convinced claims I and II are non-core proceedings
--  2 counts of the complaint would be left with him in any event
--  he has discretion.

Interestingly, from the bench, he did not rule that Claims I and II are
core matters, he simply stated that he was not convinced they were
non-core.  We have a right to an immediate appeal.  There are definitely
pros and cons to it.  I'd be happy to discuss them with you in person or do
an email for your consideration.  Let me know which way you'd like the
analysis.

We have only 10 days from the entry of the order to file a notice of
appeal.  I'm not certain whether the order denying the arbitration was
entered today, but if not, it probably will be entered tomorrow.   For
planning purposes, let's assume that our notice of appeal has to be filed
on December 22, which is next Friday.

3179,"Eric, 
Nice to hear back from you, and nice talking to you earlier.   
It seems like days ago that Adnan and I were hanging out in Saint Louis with  
nothing to do but drinking, smoking, and gambling.  (I did most of the smoking, and Khan the gambling).  But this December it will have been three years since we finished our college careers.  Where does the time go?
That's very interesting, Adnan never mentioned the gambling.  But it doesnt surprise me after seeing him in our last trip to Vegas. 
Sure I wouldn't mind hanging out with your friend if she is similarly 
inclined.  It can be a bit awkward at times being around so many people who 
you do not know, and I am by nature a quiet person.  I'm not looking for 
anything more than just good company.  As you may know I just broke up with 
my girlfriend of two years, and I'm just getting used to being on my own so 
to speak.
Yes, I totally understand.  Like I said, i'm not trying to play matchmaker, I just wanted both of you to have good company.  I know how you must feel.  In a way, I'm all of my friends' ""councelor.""  I'm the one they usually come to when they have relationship problems and need advice, or plainly vent.  So I know these past few weeks have probably not been easy for you... and all I can really tell you is that time and self realization will heal the pain.  We've all been there.  
Although I have every intention of attending your wedding, I should let you 
know that my father has been ill, and that there may be matters which might 
require my attention in San Francisco.  Hopefully, this will not be the 
case.  And if so I promise to make a trip out to visit both of you in the 
near future. 
Not a problem.  Family is always first.   
Like I was saying earlier... Friday night is when my best guy friend, Mike, was thinking of taking Adnan out with all the other guys.  Alllll the guys know that anything to do with stripping is out of the question.  So Mike suggested going out to a bar or something like that and just drinking, and do the ""guy thing"".  whatever that may be.  I thought maybe you could get in contact with him and see what you guys want to do.  But keep in mind, that the wedding rehearsal is the next morning (sat 12/01/01) at 11:30am.  So I need my fiance to be ""okay"" by that time :-)  
Here's mike's e-mail...

Welcome to Advantage, the new monthly newsletter from the Associate & Analyst Program. We're a big family - we have close to 850 associates and analysts working all over the globe - and we want to keep you current on what's going on. We have new programs, perspectives and opportunities to tell you about, as well as births, marriages and social events. We know you don't have much time, so we will use this newsletter as a quick way to stay in touch.

We're welcoming our latest class of 200 or so Associates and Analysts who have recently joined Enron. Newcomers and ""old-timers"" will find that the A&A Program is a great foundation for their careers at Enron. Some of our activities are learning experiences, and some are just plain fun. But they all help to build your network within Enron, which you will draw on frequently in the years ahead.

So here's to a great Fall. I look forward to seeing some of you this month at our pizza and brown-bag lunches and at other occasions. Let me know how things are going. And let's stay in touch.

Regards,
Billy Lemmons 
VP/ A&A Program

Fall Recruiting Season Kick-off
It's a great time to be recruiting new Associates and Analysts to Enron. While other organizations have cut back on new hires, Enron's appetite for new talent remains robust. In this environment, we expect to recruit the best of the best. We're visiting a broader list of universities than ever before. In the past we may have preferred hiring students from only a select group of schools.  The reality is that we value diversity and top performers come from many different schools.  As such, we think it is best to cast a wider, shallower net, rather than go too deep into the talent pool in only a few places.

3236,"Steve, a week ago today, the judge denied our request for preliminary 
injunction, but kept the proceeding open (so we can go back on an expedited 
basis if we need to) and warned Broadwing that its many cuts were very gross 
and that they should exercise extreme care (""digging with a hand trowel, if 
you can,"" he said) as they continue their construction.  He also said that 
they were facing some pretty significant damages, and that if they cut us 
again he would probably issue an injunction.  He was concerned that future 
cuts, after our system is lit, will generate much higher damage claims from 
us.

If you want a little more detail, the judge ruled that we had met 3 of the 4 
tests to get the injunction--likelihood of succeeding on the merits, 
likelihood of suffering irreparable harm, and satisfied the public policy 
protecting existing utility facilities.  But he found that on the 4th test, 
the comparison of damages, that the damages B'wing would suffer if the 
injunction were granted were similar to the damages we will suffer if it were 
not granted, but the 30 or so menial construction hands who would be laid off 
by the contractors, if the injunction were granted, tipped the balance.  

We knew that the chances of a shutdown were remote, and we were surprised we 
came so close.  Our goal was to get the judge's help to make B'wing use safer 
construction practices, to avoid future cuts (which they have done:  they are 
potholing now, constructing slower, and listening to our inspectors, although 
they still refuse to sign a Construction Coordination Agreement, which we've 
repeatedly offered).  Our outside counsel and witnesses did a great job, and 
the judge was very stern in his warning to Broadwing.  I think the Broadwing 
people realize that  Broadwing did not ""win"" this proceeding, and that a 
rather large hammer is now hanging over their head.

Next steps: I believe Brad is going to meet on-site with Broadwing's Bill 
Muckle, to explore future steps to prevent future cuts.  We are keeping the 
courthouse warm.  That's about it.

Please let me know if you'd like more info.

Following our meeting I have been discussing the voice recording requirements 
with other members of the project team, and I need to correct one piece of 
information I supplied to you. 

Regarding the recording of internal calls, it is possible to not record calls 
made on the Lucent digital phones internally, but ALL calls made on turrets 
(the phones the traders use) would have to be recorded, whether internal or 
external. This is due to the way in which the voice recording system must be 
connected to the turret system. Therefore, could you assume when considering 
what the corporate requirements are that we cannot exclude internal calls. 

My apologies for this mistake, we are going to investigate the development of 
a solution to this problem with the vendors under consideration. I will keep 
you in touch with all progress that is made. 

Many thanks for your time this morning.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Paul E. Stein, Deputy Attorney General
State of California
Office of the Attorney General
455 Golden Gate Avenue, Suite 11000
San Francisco, CA  94102
Dear Mr. Stein:
This responds to your letter of July 13, 2001, which I received on July 16,
regarding your discussions with Mike Kirby and me on behalf of Enron Energy
Services (EES).  This will confirm that you agreed that our discussions with
the Office of the Attorney General on the subject of its subpoenas served
upon EES are without prejudice to, and will not waive, any rights by EES to
object to either this investigation or the subpoenas in any subsequent
action or proceeding.  Your letter of July 13, 2001, notes some, but by no
means all, of EES's objections to the subpoenas.  Without attempting to
catalogue these objections, the following points in your July 13 letter
merit mention:
*	Confidentiality order:  This confirms we will provide you with a
suitable alternative confidentiality order for your review this week.
*	Customer notification:  EES has been, and continues to be in the
process of, providing appropriate notice to all commercial customers
(without regard for any other definition) in California with regard to your
request for their contracts.  We do not agree that our duty, if any, to
resist production under the terms of these contracts has been discharged.
*	Territoriality:  Our objections to your requests for out of state
documents and the testimony by out of state residents arises under
California statutes, common law, and California and the Constitution of the
United States.
*	Document repository:  We do not believe the Attorney General is
entitled to production of any documents other than at a central location.
*	Production:  Without waiving any of our objections to either the
Attorney General's investigation or the subpoena, EES is prepared to produce
documents which reside within California which are unambiguously called for
by the subpoena served on June 27, 2001, on the condition that we reach a
mutually acceptable confidentiality order to govern their production.
Assuming a mutually agreeable protective order, we are ready to begin doing
so on or about July 30.
Thank you for your courtesies in these matters.
Sincerely,

Texas General Land Office Prepay
Cannon Interests Prepay and Storage Hedge
Working Gas Inventory True Up
Lyondell/Citgo Issue",,,Texas General Land Office Lyondell/Citgo Issue
3248,"
This article was written by Tamim Ansary, an Afghani-American writer. 
Here is his take on Afghanistan and the mess we are in.
Please read it to the end.  The last paragraphs are the most important. 



I've been hearing a lot of talk about ""bombing Afghanistan back to the
Stone Age."" Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, conceded that this would
mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do with this
atrocity.  ""But we're at war, we have to accept collateral damage. What else
can we do?"" Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether or not 
""we have the belly to do what must be done.""  

I have thought especially hard about the issues being raised because 
I am from Afghanistan.  And even though I've lived here for 35 years, 
I've never lost track of what's going on there. 

So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where I'm
standing.  

I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. 
There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the
atrocity
in New York. I agree that something must be done about those monsters. 
But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan. 
They're not even the government of Afghanistan. 

The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in
1997. 
Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan. 
When you think Taliban, think Nazis. 
When you think Bin Laden, think Hitler. 
And when you think ""the people of Afghanistan"" think ""the Jews in the
concentration camps."" 

It's not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity. 
They were also the first victims of the perpetrators. 
They would rejoice if someone would come in, take out the Taliban, 
and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their
country.  

Some say, ""why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban?"" 
The answer is: they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated, suffering.  
A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are 500,000 
disabled orphans in Afghanistan -- a country with no economy, no food.  
There are millions of widows. And the Taliban has been burying these widows
alive 
in mass graves. The soil is littered with land mines, and the farms were all
destroyed by the Soviets. 
This is why the people of Afghan have not overthrown the Taliban.  

We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age.  
Trouble is, that's already been done. 
The Soviets took care of that already.  
Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. 
Level their houses? Done.  
Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done. 
Eradicate their hospitals? Done. 
Destroy their infrastructure? 
Cut them off from medicine and health care? 
Too late.
The Russians already did all that. 
New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs. 
Would the bombs at least get the Taliban? Not likely. 
In today's Afghanistan, only the Taliban eat, only they have the means to
move around.
They would slip away and hide. 
Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans ... they don't move
too fast.  
They don't even have wheelchairs. 
Flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldn't be a strike against the
criminals who did this horrific thing. 
Actually it would only be making common cause with the Taliban -- by raping
once again 
the people they've been raping all this time.  

So what else is there? What can be done? 

Let me now speak with true fear and trembling. 
The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops. 
When people speak of ""having the belly to do what needs to be done,"" 
they're thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many people as
needed ... 
having the belly to overcome the moral qualms of killing innocent people. 
Let's pull our heads out of the sand. What's actually on the table is
Americans dying. 
And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through
Afghanistan to Bin Laden's hideout.  

It's much bigger than that folks.  Because to get any troops to Afghanistan,

we'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let us? Not likely. 
The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first. 
Will other Muslim nations just stand by? 

You see where I'm going? 

We're flirting with a world war between Islam and the West.

And guess what: 
THAT IS BIN LADEN'S PROGRAM!.  
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS!
THAT IS WHY HE DID THIS! 

Read his speeches and statements.  It's all right there. 
He really believes Islam would beat the west. 

It might seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into 
Islam vs. the West, then he has a billion soldiers. 
If the west wreaks a holocaust on those lands, then that's a billion
people with nothing left to lose ... and that's even better from Bin Laden's
point
of view. 

He's probably wrong.  In the end the west would probably win.  Whatever that
would mean. 

But the war would last for years, and millions would die, not just theirs
but ours. 

Who has the belly for that? 

Bin Laden does.

I would like the following sentences added under the  I. Pilot Meter and
Meter Add-on Ownership Program.

""Customer ownership of meters and add-ons reduces the cost of new facilities
through the avoidance of the tax gross-up on contributions in aid of
construction.  This can be a significant dollar amount for large
interconnections which require special facilities which are paid by the
requesting customer.""

Please insert this between the 2nd and 3rd full sentences of the first
paragraph.  With this change, I do not think any additional testimony needs
to be filed on the meter issues.  This is the same approach in the PG&E

be addressed in rebuttal.

I've reviewed WestLB's optional early termination language which is similar 
to the other's which I've reviewed (e.g., Goldman, Chase, Merrill, etc.).  
Here's how it works for your 3/26/01 - 3/26/21 swap:

(1)  March 28, 2011 is the ""Break Date"" or ""Early Termination Date"".  

(2)  Either party can give notice of early termination to the other party on 
the day that is 5 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date.  By the way, this 
is also the day on which the parties must mutually agree on 5 leading dealers 
in the relevant market in case the valuation process in (3) below is later 
disputed by the other party.

(3)  The party giving notice determines (in good faith) the Cash Settlement 
Amount as of 11 a.m. NY time on the Break Date (which should be the 
mid-market value of the deal on the Break Date.

(4)  Payment will occur on the Break Date.

(5)  I am adding a provision requiring the exercising party to notify the 
other party on the day that is 3 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date.  
There may be a dispute over the calculation and the parties will need to 
resolve.

(6)  If the parties cannot agree on the Cash Settlement Amount calculation, 
then the party who gave notice seeks mid-market quotes from the 5 leading 
dealers (previously agreed to) at 11 a.m. on the day that is 2 NY Business 
Days before the Break Date.  The confirm describes how the quotes are 
averaged.  A minimum of 3 quotes is essential.  Payment is still made on the 
Break Date.


George:

(1)  Please verify that the Break Date is 3/28/11.  My copy is a little fuzzy 
and the date could actually be 3/26/11.

(2)  I've marked the confirm and faxed it to you.  Please note that:

 (a)  the second paragraph purports to incorporate the 1991 ISDA Definitions 
but the master overrides this language because it incorporates the 1991 
Definitions ""as amended, modified, superceded or replaced from time to time"" 
(i.e., the 2000 ISDA Definitions).  There is a problem if  WestLB disagrees 
because I've left some language in Paragraph 3 ""as is"" since it is based upon 
the 2000 ISDA Definitions. 

 (b)  no need to say that the Calculation Agent is ""as otherwise stated in 
the Agreement"" because WestLB is stated to be the Calculation Agent in the 
Agreement.

him for the name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in

April 12, 1995, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title

ENA's early energy price swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently 
trading weather derivatives, I think you would agree that it would be prudent 
to supersede the existing agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This 
relates to my conversation with Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals 
under the existing master but incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions

because the instances it addresses would probably fall within the definition

to execute the sale of the Quicksilver Shares.  I explained that the 
operations people are reluctant to establish an account if there is little 
activity anticipated.  In the case of this JEDI I account, the only 
transaction this will take place is the SALE of the Quicksilver shares, there 
will be no further activity.  In fact, we will probably be closing the 
account soon after the trade is settled.  He is very much aware of the 
situation and is going to contact the appropriate people in Chicago to 
instruct them to be fully cooperative with Enron in establishing this 
account.  

I realize this is a huge inconvenience to have to set up an account for this 
one trade, but given the negotiations with the company and Bear Stearns, it 
is the best thing to do.  If anybody has any questions, please let me know.  
As I understand the events, the following items are being prepared by us

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside 
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side 
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly 
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some of 
my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that

With respect to our recent exchange of voice-mail messages,
I await to receive from you at your earliest opportunity
a draft of the Amendment to the Credit Support Annex between
Enron North America Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated.

I have also been advised by our Credit Department that we are

ISDA being amended above would serve as a basis for this new

on the two ISDA Master agreements for RBC and Bow Valley.  Does the bank 
require two signature lines?  What is the wording you need for Bow Valley's 
execution line (I assume it will be something like ""Bow Valley Trust, by its 
duly appointed Trustee, X""?

Can you let me know as soon as possible so that I can have the standard forms 
of the actual ISDA agreement and Credit Support Annex prepared for execution 
tomorrow.  For logistics, can you also let me know whether the people who 
will be executing the documents on behalf of RBC and Bow Valley in Calgary or

3362,"A seemingly unresolved issue is our right to prepay before the end of the 
term of the swaps.  I believe this is something we want commercially, but 
what is not clear to me is how we envision this working commercially.  In 
other words, although any swap can be bought out, I do not believe the ISDA 
documentation contemplates agreed terms for buy-out.  Rather, the party 
seeking to get out early asks for the counterparty's offer and hits the offer 
or not.  If RBC or Swapco was not willing to make an we are willing to 
transact at, we might not be able to get out.  Perhaps Sara could advise if 
my interpretation of the ISDA is right and, if so, Brian and Soma can confirm 
how they see prepayment working without a specified prepayment right.

In the absence of an executed master agreement, we never want the GTC's to 
change!  The reason is that bankruptcy protection for swap agreements 
requires a single agreement for all swap transactions.  If you don't have an 
ISDA master agreement in place, you want your single set of GTC's to be 
viewed by a court as a single agreement.  Having different versions of the 
GTC's does not look like a single agreement.

I will try to convince Dave Adams that we should retain our GTC's but move 
forward on an ISDA which would then govern all online and offline trades.

Happy (somewhat belated) new year.  I hope you are doing well in sunny
downtown Houston.  I am writing from Princeton where minutes ago I
happily finished my Economics exam, the last of the semester.  In
reviewing the agenda for the rest of the academic year, I thought it
might be a good time to finalize summer plans as well.
     I will be occupied with a job here at Princeton until June 3 - I am
working logistics for part of this year's reunions.  After that date, I
would need only a day or two of turnaround time before coming out to
Houston.  I could conceivably be in the office by Wednesday, June 6.
Depending upon your needs at the office and the possibility of a short
cultural study on a small island off of the coast of western Sumatra, I
could plan on being in Houston until at least early August.  Please let
me know what your plans are on the other end.

Thanks in advance for your attention.
Sincerely, Dan

Bush: War in 'Dangerous Phase' <http://letters.washingtonpost.com/YARH0617DDE5C60F8C7C>
President Bush said today the war in Afghanistan is moving into a very dangerous phase for U.S. troops, with some likely to lose their lives. Bush also said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ""will find out"" the consequences of locking weapons inspectors out of his country.

Rick--as you know, the annual meeting for RGA is coming up in Las Vegas on NOvember 8-10.  I will be attending and I am also taking your spot at the Western Governors University board meeting early on Thursday the 8th at the same location.

My plan is to also have Barbara attend, with the intent that she work on developing a relationship with Governor Huckabee in Arkansas (we havn't had contact with him before,  but found that one of his commissioners at the Arkansas PUC seems to be favorable on our RTO position--one of the few that we can find in the southeast that even lean in the right direction)

I also would like for Steve Montovano and Paul Kaufman to come up for the Friday night dinner after your direct reports meeting being held that week in Colorado Springs.

Let me know if you have any thoughts to the contrary.  Otherwise I will go ahead with these plans. The only other individual that I think might be appropriate would be Jean Ryall in order for her to have some face time with the Texas delegation.",Rick Barbara Huckabee Steve Montovano Paul Kaufman Jean Ryall,,RGA

On this same subject of Chairman Wood, I am told that he met with Rep. Doug Ose (energy subcommittee chairman of the Government Reform Committee) and Ose's ""energy advisory board"" on Wednesday of this week and said similar things.  He made a big deal out of a Big Mac analogy -- saying that whether you ordered one in Portland, Oregon or Portland, Maine the product is the same.  With RTOs, he supposedly said this meant if the rules are standardized, the number of RTOs becomes less important.  Those in the room, including EPSA staff, came away with the impression that Wood is backing away from only 4 RTOs based on this and other comments.  Ditto on a 12/15/01 deadline.  On the positive side, he did say that he had been consulted on the Administration's comments on the Bingaman bill and agreed that legislation without RTO language or bundled/unbundled is OK.  He understands the high risk that Congress would go the wrong way on these issues.

complaint against SCE at the PUC to compel SCE to pay the negative CTCs to 
us.  ALJ and Commissioner for Complaint are same ALJ/Comm. proposing this 
treatment.  So no chance of different outcome there.  2.  SCE should drop its 
""affiliate market abuse"" counterclaim that it filed in that proceeding.  3.  
Proposed order also implies that no cash payment--only bill credit--will be 
recognized for negative CTC.  [no suggesting mentioning this to Bryson].  4.  
Mike Day raised another alternative which would be that, for now, just get 
SCE to support ""bifurcation"" and deferral of negative CTC issue and then 
enter negotiations on payment afterwards.

Earlier this week, you received an email from the PEP team which included the 
Performance Evaluations of your employees, both Exempt and Non-Exempt.  
Please remember that the final Performance Evaluations should be completed 
with your employees, forms signed and returned to me at EB1665B no later than 
Friday, August 17th.  

For your Non-Exempt employees, I have attached a spreadsheet listing all 
eligible employees for whom you should complete a Performance Evaluation.  
However, I need the rating for each employee so it may be input into the PEP 
system.  The descriptions for Non-Exempt ratings are defined as:

1 - Consistently performs above expectations
2 - Meets expectations
3 - Does not meet expectations

Please indicate the ratings for each of your non-exempt employees listed 
below and return to me no later than Wednesday, July 11, 2001.

3497,"Eric and Tim -- I spoke with IP last week (Kathy Patton and Joe 
Lakshmanan)and their position is that the word ""parallel"" in the Terms and 
Conditions refers to load, not generation, thus if any load is capable of 
being served by either self-gen or utility resources, standby charges will be 
imposed -- retroactively, and for five years.  I left the discussion with a 
commitment that Enron would look into how the load was configured.  The 
attached draft letter solicits that, and other, info from ISU.  I think that 
we have to consider that ISU's ability to run its self-gen units without 
paying standby charges was a courtesy IP would only extend to the customer, 
not Enron.  It is not believebale that only now IP learned how the University 
uses its self-gen units -- this was probably a ""wink-and-nod"" arrangement 
between the two before Enron came into the picture.  
 This raises some possibilities: 1) ISU pays for any standby charges related 
to the units' use;  2) ISU reconfigures,at its cost, each unit so that each 
one is the sole source for the respective load being served; or, 3) there was 
a mutual mistake between Enron and ISU regarding the use of the units in 
question that is so fundamental to the deal that it needs to be unwound.  
This is a dispute for which ISU was at risk regardless of which non-utility 
entity was providing commodity service.
 In any event, I have attached a draft letter to the University that, after 
necessary changes, I believe should go out over you signature TIm.  Please 
look it over at your earliest convenience and let me know what steps you 
would like me to take next.  Thanks.

3498,"The attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the 
Commission this afternoon, in order to provide FERC staffers a concise, 
effective statement of our position while they drafted the Judge's 
recommendation.  I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner, at which 
Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the 
following high points: 

1.  The methodology of the June 19 order does not work and is totally 
inappropriate for marketers.  If price mitigation is inevitable, the Judge 
should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology.

2.  The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order 
must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and 
after October 2.

3.  All buyers, including Enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just the 
State of California and its IOU's.  Enron is a net purchaser in these markets.

4.  Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the 
methodology, not bilateral contracts, OOM sales or sales to the DWR. 

The details of these points appear in the attached document.  The Judge was 
receptive to most points.  He understood the problems that the June 19 
methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this 
should be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form 
part of his recommendation.  He agreed that the actual buyers should receive 
refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be 
subject to the refund methodology.  Although he agreed that the refund 
methodology, once implemented, should yield just and reasonable rates, he 
felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the 
matter was up to the Commission.  The Judge spoke generally and no promises 
were made as to the content of his recommendations, but hopefully this 
insight will shed some light as to the outcome.  I urged the Judge to 
recommend placing conditions to refunds, as the Commission did in its June 19 
order with its RTO filing requirement.  The judge was noncommittal on this, 
although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset.

Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday.  The Judge told 
us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday, and that 
the comments would accompany the recommendation.  Thereafter, it is likely 
that the Commission would defer to the Judge's recommendation to hold a fast 
track evidentiary hearing of 60 days duration, to determine ""unresolved 
issues of material fact"".  The scope of the hearing has not been determined, 
but  will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for 
marketers to recommend an alternative methodology.

3502,"On Wed, I met at EPSA to discuss with members - the near term future 
participation of EPSA staff and members at NERC.

A roster of participants follows this brief summary.

Most members agreed in concept that NERC must continue to be monitored at 
least in the near term because of their ""monopoly"" on the 
reliability/commercial rules.  There was agreement that NERC had moved into 
the commercial/non-reliability standards setting partly becuase the 
incumbants desgined it that way and partly due to a lack of another industry 
representative forum  for FERC to delegate to.  Some members were encouraged 
that GISB was interested in becoming an alternative forum (EISB) and pointed 
to GISB successes in creating an efficient Bulletin Board for Gas in response 
to FERC orders.  The members also realized that most of the NERC problems are 
caused by the native load exception which the gas industry did not have to 
deal with making their restructuring easier.

EPSA staff will focus on representing EPSA members' viewpoints to the 
independent board members to establish working relationships and to provide 
market perspectives as well as governance problems within the NERC 
structure.  

Many EPSA members also felt that EPSA staff could do more to provide 
information regarding NERC issues that affect the markets so that a greater 
number of members can convey their positions to the NERC Committee and 
Subcommittee market representatives. Some possible email/members only 
bulletin board was discussed.

Reliant (John Orr) also expressed concern over continuing to allow NERC (as 
opposed to the RTOs)  to set the commercial standards.  Most agreed that NERC 
does not design efficient commercial/market standards and should leave the 
non-reliablity rules to RTOs.  Others (myself, DENA, Ontario Power Gen) who 
participate on NERC groups agreed to this in concept but raised the problem 
that many of the reliability rules overlap commercial rules with no ""bright 
line"" between the two.

Attached are a few documents that set out Enron's position on governance 
issues.  Each document is somewhat case specific (eg. GridFlorida focuses on 
the governance problems in  Florida, etc) but you will see our general 
position from each document.  As you will see in the GridFlorida pleading, we 
urge FERC to order Florida to implement a governance structure similar to 
that in PJM, which has worked quite well over the past couple of years.  In 
the California White Paper, we focus on the problems with the stakeholder 
board which has since been disbanded and replaced with a board chosen by the 
California government.  In the last California protest, we focus on the 
problems with the California government putting in their own board.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need other documents.

3509,"The Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee meet for almost six hours today and 
approved an amended version of H.R. 1647, Chairman Barton's emergency 
legislation to aid California, by a 17-13 party line vote.  The full Energy 
and Commerce Committee may take it up as early as next week (probably 
Thursday, May 17th).

The Subcommittee DEFEATED an amendment by Rep. Waxman (D-CA) to impose 
wholesale price caps for 18 months.  The amendment was defeated 12-20 with 
all Republicans voting against, including the three from California and Rep. 
Greg Walden (R-OR), who while seen as the last to decide to oppose the price 
cap amendment, was the most forceful and articulate in opposition to the 
amendment.  Also voting ""NO"" were Democratic Reps. Ralph Hall (D-TX) and 
Chris John (D-TX), with which we had met in recent days.  The final vote 
tracked our whip count going into the meeting.

Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD) offered and withdrew an amendment to delete the 
""negawatts"" provision.  There was bipartisan criticism that while the concept 
made sense, there were potential problems in terms of possible games playing, 
including end users being able to sell power while not actualy reducing their 
normal power levels.  Another member said that electric coops that are 
required to sell at cost could have customers then go out and resell that 
power and make a lot of money.  Several Members said businesses could shut 
down, put workers out of work and become energy marketers and make more 
money.  Chairman Barton made a forceful defense of negawatts.  While the 
amendment to strike was deleted, we will need to respond to these criticisms 
and shore this up before full committee next week.  There will be another 
attempt to delete at full committee unless these concerns are addressed in an 
amended version.

Ranking Democrat Rick Boucher (D-VA) offered and withdrew an amendment to 
reinstate FERC maximum prices for the secondary transmission market, thus 
reversing the Feb. 2000 FERC order.  This woudl last for 18 months.  
Chairman  Barton said he agreed with Boucher that there is a problem with 
what appear to be high gas transmission rates to California, but he disagrees 
with the proposed remedy.  He pledged to work with Boucher before Full 
Committee mark-up. We are obtaining a copy of this amendment and should 
analyze it ASAP for its potential impact on Enron operations.

Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) offered and withdrew an amendment to impose a series of 
new tests to be administered by FERC all with the goal of discouraging spot 
market transactions, or at least what he would define as excessive use of the 
spot market, and at the same time encourage ""deep bilateral mechanisms.""  The 
mechanisms included a ""market balance test"" that would say only sellers with 
a commitment to the long term market could sell in the spot market at 
unregulated rates and ""spot market circuit breakers"" that would be triggered 
when reserves are low in a given market.  Chairman Barton said he likes the 
concept of a spot market circuit breaker, but felt that the amendment was too 
complicated to be evaluated today.  We will also pursue an analysis of this 
amendment since it will likely be offered again in some form.

Mr. Markey also offered and withdrew a ""net metering"" proposal that would 
establish federal interconnection standards for individual consumers who 
would want to use fuel cells and other renewable technology to put power onto 
the system.  It was interesting that those who opposed negawatts spoke 
favorably of net metering even though they are complementary.

The subcommittee by voice vote adopted a Walden Amendment to strike the 
section of the bill that would have required an RTO if 10 of the western 
governors approved it.  The debate was pro-RTO but the rationale for deleting 
the provision is that one is already being formed and Members from those 
states did not want to upset the work already under way.

A series of other amendments on other matters were offered and withdrawn, 
none of which relate to our activities.",Barton Waxman Greg Walden Ralph Hall Chris John Albert Wynn Rick Boucher Boucher Ed Markey Markey negawatts,,"The Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Commerce Committee Democratic Reps D-MD FERC Boucher before Full

Lockyer lockdown 


Not wanting to be outdone by Gov. Gray Davis, California Attorney General 
Bill Lockyer recently tried his hand at Sacramento's new favorite game: 
demonizing power generators. 
Elaborating on his plan to file criminal charges against energy officials, 
Lockyer singled out Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay for imprudent remarks. 
""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell,"" Lockyer told The 
Wall Street Journal, ""that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi 
my name is Spike, honey.""' 
Get it? 
Spike would proceed to rape, maul and otherwise abuse Lay. 
Real funny, isn't it? 
Rape is widely considered commonplace in prison, and for good reason. Human 
Rights Watch estimates that as many 140,000 inmates have been raped in 
penitentiaries nationwide. 
In a recent study, the organization documented instances of sexual slavery 
taking place in prisons in six different states -- including California. 
That should be a serious concern for the state's top law-enforcement official 
-- not a laughing matter. 
Lockyer might have only been kidding, but his joke contains a tacit admission 
that rape is rampant in the state prison system. It suggests that he thinks 
this illegal and unconstitutional horror might, on occasion, serve as just 
punishment for some. 
Perhaps that's why prison officials -- in California and elsewhere -- have 
done so little to contain the problem. 
But their neglect comes at society's expense. Sexual abuse in American 
prisons hardens prisoners and makes them more dangerous upon their release. 
Rather than rehabilitating criminals, dangerous prisons reinforce their sense 
of lawlessness. 
We're willing to write off Lockyer's statement as merely thoughtless and 
unfunny, but we doubt that others will be quick to let him off so lightly. 
It's hard to imagine that a lawyer representing a raped inmate -- or the 
entire class of raped inmates -- would be quite so forgiving. 
In a lawsuit against the state corrections system, a quote from the attorney 
general making light of rampant sexual violence in state prisons could be 
damning. 
As the state's top attorney, Lockyer should know better than to serve up 
political rhetoric that could open up his clients -- the taxpayers -- to 
millions of dollars in legal penalties. 
His reckless words and callous attitude do little to inspire public 
confidence.

A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs group commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to California.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? ""What we do in life echoes through eternity"".  I think of these words often and believe them more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and internal to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whether in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere.  

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what we have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal appreciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportunity to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where these changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to earn your trust and respect.  

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advance of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For those not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take some additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work and business demands permitting.

Thank you.

this. The issue I have been faced with, however, is 
simply this: I am covering power and gas for three countries on my own. The 
demands on my time have been enormous and I have given
Viviana as much of my time as possible. Indeed, at the last PRC, there was 
significant pressure to place her in the ""has issues"" category
and I resisted on the grounds that she needed more time to find her stride. 
We have had a number of long meetings where I have noted
in detail what my expectations are and provided her with suggestions on how 
to improve. This has included helping her outline a research paper
how to write a slide presentation, what research sources to go to, how to 
extract information from people on the phone. In a better world
I would spend more time with her to bring her along, but I am horribly 
stretched and need a researcher who is more effective to help
me get the job done. I have also gotten other feedback (including from the 
head of the Frankfurt office) that has been rather negative.
My view is that rather than prolong the mutual agony, we should begin the 
process of managing her out and helping her secure more
appropriate employment outside the firm. Please let me know what you think.

3529,"Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with 
Glynn:

Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing 
included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was 
apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is 
nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on 
April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured 
claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and 
state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as 
uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the 
claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the 
court determines the validity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity 
to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several 
reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) 
we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the 
real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as 
significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers 
... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on 
the creditors committee anyway).",Glynn,,Enron CTC PGE PG&E the Creditors' Committee PX ISO

At issue was whether the California refund claims would be decoupled from the supplier/creditor claims of Enron and other sellers to whom California owes money.  For both strategic and tactical reasons, it is critical that these claims be resolved in the same adjudications and ultimate judgments.  In yesterday's prehearing, Enron and other suppliers defeated (at least for now) a very real threat of decoupling.  In addition, Gary Fergus did a very able job at educating the judge on (a) the inadequacies of California's data supporting its refund claims, and (b) the likelihood that California is cooking that data.

3537," RTO Week

Day 3 -- October 17, 2001

Standardizing RTO Tariffs

The morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in RTO tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country.  There were many diverse views on the panel, and the Staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session.  

The panelists were:  Ricky Bittle, Arkansas Electric Coop; Jim Caldwell, American Wind; Peter Esposito, Dynegy; Rory McMinn, New Mexico PSC; Glenn Ross, Dominion Resources; Audrey Zibelman, XCEL Energy.

General Observations

This panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels.  Dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges FERC to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff.  Dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by FERC, noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years.  EXCEL has it's own focus - they want to be an ITC and want to provide many of the RTO services without being an RTO.  The Wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an ""as available"" basis.   The commissioner from New Mexico does not want standardization, does not want FERC stepping on the state's jurisdictional toes, and does not want New Mexico ratepayers' rates to go up.  Arkansas Electric Coop insists that SPP transmission capacity is full, so if competitors want to move power through SPP, new transmission must first be built.

I am somewhat concerned that some of the Commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary.  While the Dynegy concept had merit at one time, it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues, and it could take many months to go through the process, only to have FERC, in the end, decide the details anyway.  We may want to submit comments on this issue to FERC at the conclusion of RTO Week.

What Services Should be Standardized?

Overall, Dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized -- timing, confirmation processing, maintenance issues, bus names, ramping protocols, assumptions for ATC calculations, posting times, bumping rules, and settlement time.  With regard to congestion management, it should not be standardized between RTOs.  

XCEL does not support a standardized tariff but urges FERC to standardize some issues such as CBM calculations, reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties.  American Wind says FERC must focus on having liquid spot markets in RTOs and not worry about tariff standardization.  Dominion cautions FERC about Dynegy's proposal to let the industry work out the details.  He says this is what happened with Order No. 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out.  

Should FERC Retain CBM?

Ricky (Arkansas Coop) believes that the bigger the RTO, the less important CBM is because the RTO will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing.  Dynegy thinks CBM should be eliminated.  Dominion thinks CBM should be retained but the rules need to be changed.  CBM should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected.  Nor should CBM be standardized because needs vary region to region.  However, because CBM is used for load, the cost of CBM should be allocated to load.  All panelists agreed with the concept that if CBM is retained, load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff.

Network Versus Point to Point Service

Peter (Dynegy) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point, similar to transportation service offered in gas -- firm and interruptible.  Peter suggests starting with the CRT tariff proposed several years ago.  Glenn (Dominion) thinks the CRT is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point.  

Should all Transmission Service Be Under the RTO's Tariff?

Most of the panelists said yes, all service should be under the tariff, but Ricky Bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years, no more than 10 years.  Commissioner McMinn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states' jurisdiction.

What Services Need to Be Changed Under a New RTO Tariff?

Jim (Wind) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize ""as available"" resources.  Ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff.  XCEL urges FERC to recognize the distinction between RTOs and ITCs and allow ITCs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs.

Ray Alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on Cost Allocation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

-Prof. Charles Cicchetti, Univ. of Southern California
-Comm. Robert Nelson, Mich. Pub. Serv. Comm.
-Marji Phillips, Exelon Power Team (attorney)
-Sonny Popowski, PA Office of Consumer Advocate
-Craig Roach, Boston Pacific
-Anjali Sheffrin, Dir. Market Analysis, Cal ISO

Summary:  Market Monitor (MM) should be independent.  Too much MM transparency is a problem -- MM function should be done privately to FERC.  MM should be an early warning signal.

Specifics:
The morning started on a rather humorous note with Marji Phillips introducing herself as ""the guilty party so to speak in front of you"" (referencing the PECO/Exelon purported violation of standards of conduct).  She stated that it is not the role of the MM to interfere to make sure that power prices are the lowest in each hour -- the MM should monitor the RTO and the markets and be part of a creative solution (without imposing its own MM penalties/mitigation).  She used the Midwest price spikes of 98 as an example, and stated that a poor MM would probably have worsened the market solution that was reached without intervention.

Most of the group agreed with Prof. Cicchetti that the MM should not be the policeman, judge and jury.  He also stressed the importance of the MM being aware of the interaction of markets (i.e., California:  gas, electricity, NOx).  As Craig Roach said, the MM should look at more than market power -- it should also look at market conditions and market rules and be a vehicle for innovation.  Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not ""go to the farmer for costs.""  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.  

Many thought that there should be some standardization of the information provided to the MM.  Most agreed that the information should be provided on a confidential basis, especially before any specific problem has been found.

Sonny Popowski stated that the RTO must be truly independent or the MM simply catalogs the market failures.

Comm. Nelson said that the MM should have unfettered access to all costs and should have the ability for ""cease and desist"" orders.  Also, stated that ITCs/transcos should be monitored to the extent that they favor transmission solutions over DG and generation.  On the very positive side, he said RTO policy should proceed.

Ms. Sheffrin said that it would be simple to implement a rolling 12 month cost plus 10% competitive benchmark, and prices above this should be mitigated.  She said this would allow bidders to ""self police"" so as to not hit the benchmark.  Most of the others disagreed with her, pointing out that a simplistic test such as this does not account for market conditions.  It was pointed out that there were too many different MMs in Cal with no one acting.  Someone also commented that one reason participants did not want to turn data over to Cal ISO was because it was a contesting party.

All thought that DSM should be included in the market in order to be considered in mitigation.

Comm. Breathitt asked Ms. Sheffrin why the price cap wouldn't work in Cal.  She responded that the problems in Cal were with the need for LT contracts and other issues (she also said that it is not a zonal/lmp issue).  Importantly, she said that consumers are now conserving 3000-5000 MWs annually since getting the appropriate price signals.  Mr. Popowski said that he likes the price caps in PJM.  Margie countered and said that ""icap"" in PJM is the problem.  

FERC staff asked if the MM should monitor bilaterals.  Marji said absolutely not (between consenting companies and should not be unraveled).  Both agreed that the MM may at times need access to these in order to understand what was happening in the spot market.

protests (unlike the attached generic protest) against AEP, Entergy and 
Southern due to problems with each utility's OASIS system.  EPMI plans to

requests for continuation of market based rates.  The attachment now includes 
a reference to Staff's investigation that states participation in an RTO, 
without the proper safeguards, including the elimination of the native load 
exception, will not necessarily reduce the utilities' ability to discriminate

perception that the SE is the worst area for discriminatory practices.

Attached is the East Power RTO Status Matrix as of 12.8.00.  I think that 
we've captured almost all issues (although we may need attributes to add or 
change as we move forward).  

Additionally, given that this is the first time we've put out the matrix, the 
regional people need to confirm the proper response to each attribute (so 
some things may change as I confirm the responses).  As the RTOs are so 
undefined in many cases, we are using our judgement as appropriate.

Hope this is helpful.   My thought is to re-fresh monthly.

Dow Jones Online News, Tuesday, April 10, 2001 at 11:17 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Edison International (EIX) detailed the lawsuits 
filed against the company and its Southern California Edison utility unit in 
a filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
On Monday, SoCal Edison and the California Independent System Operator (ISO) 
were sued in federal district court in Los Angeles by Inland Paperboard & 
Packaging Inc., a company that owns a cogeneration facility. The lawsuit 
seeks payment of $5.3 million for energy and capacity delivered to SoCal 
Edison under a qualifying facilities, or QF, contract from November 2000 
through March, plus additional and treble damages for alleged interference 
with Inland Paperboard's ability to sell power to third parties. 
Brea Power Partners L.P., a company that operates a landfill gas-fired plant, 
filed a lawsuit against SoCal Edison and Edison International on April 5 
seeking $1.65 million for energy and capacity delivered to SoCal Edison under 
a QF contract from November 2000 through March, plus $24 million of 
additional damages. 
On April 3, SoCal Edison was served with a lawsuit filed by EF Oxnard Inc., 
the owner-operator of a cogeneration facility, seeking damages of at least 
$13.5 million for nonpayment by SoCal Edison for power deliveries under a QF 
contract from November 2000 through February. 
Also on April 3, SoCal Edison was served with a lawsuit filed by four 
cogeneration companies affiliated with Delta Power LLC seeking damages of at 
least $42 million for nonpayment by SoCal Edison for power deliveries under 
four QF contracts from November 2000 through February. 
Watson Cogeneration Co., which operates a cogeneration facility, filed a 
lawsuit on March 29 against SoCal Edison seeking payment of damages of at 
least $150 million plus exemplary damages. 
On March 28, SoCal Edison was served with a lawsuit filed by NP Cogen, the 
owner-operator of a cogeneration facility. The amount of damages sought isn't 
specified, but the complaint alleges that the amount owed by SoCal Edison is 
about $8 million. 
Also, IMC Chemicals Inc. is suing SoCal Edison for $2.8 million, a group of 
wind energy suppliers affiliated with FPL Group has filed a suit seeking 
""several million dollars,"" two geothermal energy suppliers affiliated with 
Caithness Corp. filed a lawsuit seeking more than $20 million, and a group of 
geothermal energy suppliers affiliated with CalEnergy Operating Co. filed a 
lawsuit seeking immediate payment of $100 million plus exemplary damages. 
According to Tuesday's SEC filing, several other owners or operators of 
qualifying facilities have given SoCal Edison letters demanding that the 
company pay them past-due amounts, requesting approval to sell their energy 
and capacity to third parties, and in some cases threatening legal action. 
As reported, Edison struck a deal with California Gov. Gray Davis on Monday, 
under which the state would purchase SoCal Edison's transmission system for 
$2.76 billion. The state also would make other financial arrangements that 
would allow the company to repay some $3.5 billion in accumulated power 
bills.

3544,"1. Alberta PPA - Transmission Cost Responsibility Hearing 

Enron is leading a coalition of 5 PPA Buyers that successfully advocated the AEUB to convene a process/hearing (the convening of which was opposed by the PPA Owners) to consider the proposal by the Transmission Administrator to apply transmission charges to PPA Buyers for transmission capacity that solely accrues to the financial benefit of PPA Owners.  One week of hearings were held in spring 2001 with the hearing scheduled to be completed in November 2001.  Value to Enron Canada if we prevail at hearing is approximately $Cdn 60 million.

2. Alberta PPA - Alberta Government Agreement to Split Enron's Sundance B PPA in Two PPAs

Government Affairs successfully lobbied Alberta Energy officials and Minister of Energy to agree to approve regulatory changes necessary to allow for the split of Enron's PPA into two PPAs despite one of the fundamental elements of the original PPA model was that the PPAs would be very large and not divisible.  This is important as the whole PPA represents 706 MW and is likely too large for Enron to sell as a whole but a PPA of 303 MW is much more marketable to potential Enron counter parties.  Value to Enron Canada if one-half PPA is sold is projected to be approximately $Cdn 50 million.

3. Alberta PPA - Opposition to Wabamun Water Treatment Plant Expansion 

Government Affairs in conjunction with legal group has achieved ""effected person"" status in relation to an application by TransAlta (Enron's PPA Owner counterparty) to undertake an expansion to the Wabamun Water Treatment Plant.  The objective is to position Enron to resist future attempts by TransAlta to pass through the cost of this expansion to Enron.  Value to Enron Canada if we succeed is project to be approximately $Cdn 2 million.

4. Alberta - Appointment to Key Government/Industry Committees

Enron Government Affairs staff are presently members of each of the key committees in Alberta responsible for providing advice to Government and/or its appointed agents (Power Pool, TA, AEUB) on electricity market design issues, including: Advisory Committee, Power Pool Operations Committee, AEUB Electric Reliability Task Force, Industry Structure Review Consultant Selection Committee, Retail Issues Committee, IPPSA Board of Directors.  Value to Enron not quantifiable.

5.  Alberta - Enron Direct

Enron Government Affairs provided extensive support to Enron Direct in undertaking media/government launch of Enron Direct in Alberta is presently assisting Enron Direct in determining rules and requirements to expand its service offerings to B.C. natural gas market and AltaGas Utilities service territory in Alberta.  Enron Government affairs is also advocating against discriminatory exit fees proposed by Atco Gas.  Value to Enron not quantifiable.

If the meeting with the Governor is on for Thursday, lets try to have a meeting with Rafael on Friday. Could you please try to arrange the meeting for both of us?, let me know please.

With regard to majority stakes, we have indicated in several ocassions that Enron would be more than willing to increase PDVSA""s (in this case the government) stake to a higher number. So, I don't really believe this should be a showstopper for Jose. On the other hand, although we will have to see the by-laws and shareholders agreements to be precise, a 33% stakes gives you nothing more than a simple majority. Still, Shell and Exxon together clearly control the venture. It is also stupid to say that ""not in a single country in the world......."". How about Trinidad for example. I'm not sure if he is referring to the Governments or companies?.

We can clear this up in our meeting with him. Let me know if and when is he available to meet.

I have reviewed the information you sent regarding Simon Lee.   I was, in 
fact, aware of the memo sent by Sharon Butcher as I had requested that she 
detail the rationale for the decision.   While Sharon's decision is sound and 
logic based, it is ultimately a business decision.  I agree that if it is not 
illegal to provide remuneration to Simon that we should do so because it is 
not worth Enron's reputation in the market place to quibble over this issue.  
Moreover, based upon other issues that I have encountered as a result of 
promises made by the previous administration, I have no doubt that Simon was 
acting under the direction of individuals running the program.

The concern I would like for you to consider prior to making a decision about 
Simon Lee is whether Enron is prepared to offer the same remuneration to 
others who indicate that they are similarly situated.   I am not sure how 
many others may step forward but I have attached a copy of an e-mail from at 
least one individual who has a similar circumstance.  Ironically, this 
individual who was Simon Lee's roommate at Harvard chose to exercise his 
vested options.   He is now an Enron employee and is awaiting the outcome of 
Simon's situation.

In my opinion, these and other individuals like them should be treated 
consistently.  I do not advocate that we search for them but I would like to 
know that if the issue arises that it will not be necessary to expend time 
and energy on each individual case.  

Additionally, equally if not more important, is the issue of how this 
situation arose and what can be done to alleviate it in the future.   I would 
like to discuss at your convenience.

SnapStream Media - Personal Video Server Technology

SnapStream Media's goal is to use its proprietary networked video management
and streaming technology to become a major infrastructure player in the
booming markets of home digital media delivery and viewing. Chosen as a
finalist for Best of Show at the Consumer Electronics Show 2001, SnapStream
Media software enables any network appliance to watch or stream video over
wireless and wired networks. SnapStream's technology delivers the only
network-centric media solution in the market. More than 150,000 users have
downloaded SnapStream's software since its first beta release and reviews
have been written by both PC Magazine and PC World.

Product

		SnapStream Personal Video Station (PVS) serves as a personal
network-based repository of digital media. Content can be recorded from a
variety of sources including satellite, cable and antenna. Additionally,
through content partnerships, shows can also be ""recorded"" via a user's
broadband connection.
		The SnapStream.NET Back-end Services allows the company to
provide a variety of services including collection of viewing patterns and
statistics, delivery of customized advertising, and network-based delivery
of video content.
		The company is pursuing a strategy of bundling and
co-marketing to achieve penetration into the market.  In the short-term,
revenues of approximately $5 / subscriber / month will be derived for
services associated with SnapStream PVS.  Longer term, revenues will be
derived from the network-based delivery of video (movies, television shows,
news broadcasts, etc.) to the SnapStream base of viewers.

Market

		The target market is the exploding market of digital media
consumers.
		The Internet appliance market is forecasted to grow to $17.8
billion by 2004 (IDC**)
		Handheld device unit sales doubled in 2000 from 3.6M units
in 1999 to 6.9M units and are expected to grow to 33.5M units ($26B sales)
by 2004 (IDC*).
		The nascent digital home entertainment network market will
grow to $3.3 billion from 2001 to 2004 (Parks and Associates)
		By 2004, home networking device shipments are expected to
reach 29.8M, and 17.6M U.S. homes are expected to have home networks (IDC*).
		Annual shipments of digital video recorders are expected to
reach 12.9M by 2004 (IDC*).

Strategic Partners

		SnapStream Media has established bundling agreements with
leading TV tuner card manufacturers. One partner, Hauppauge Computer Works,
is the U.S. market-leading manufacturer for TV tuner cards.
		The company is in advanced discussions with Intel
Corporation around the bundling of PVS software with Intel Anypoint Home
Networking hardware. The company is also in high-level discussions with
other key home networking companies including 3Com and Linksys.

Competition

		SnapStream's competitors are in the convergence media space
and include companies such as Mediabolic, ZapMedia, and SonicBlue.
		Except for SonicBlue, all companies are in their early
stages and have not begun product sales.
		The technologies and products of these convergence media
companies address only digital audio (as opposed to digital video) giving
SnapStream a strong early-mover advantage.
		SnapStream Media holds technical expertise in the area of
streaming video, rivaled only by streaming video companies Microsoft, Apple
and Real Networks, making it difficult for other companies to compete
		SnapStream's support of consumer operating systems from
Microsoft make it convenient and cost-effective for its software to be
bundled with PCs from companies such as HP, Gateway, Compaq and Dell.
		The company's pending patent covering its networked video
platform will allow the company to further impose barriers to entry for
existing and new market players.
Competitive Advantages

		Network Video Technology - To date, SnapStream Media's
]existing streaming server currently available to the consumer market. Its
networked personal television software (SnapStream PVS) is something for
which the company has filed a patent to protect its intellectual property
position.
		Early Mover Advantage - As discussed above, the company has
a substantial lead in both vision and implemented technology in the area of
digital and networked video in the home.

3555,"	You would not be a successful journalist if you had always played it safe and
gone along with conventional thinking.  Being able to think ""outside the box""
is the mark of an open-minded person, who can see the truth in an unexpected
way.  Being open to the unexpected is essential to good investigative journalism.

	What is the single greatest political story in the world today?  Clearly it
is the worldwide escalation of violence and bloodshed, especially in the Middle
East.  According to the latest annual report of the Red Cross, there are more
armed conflicts raging around the world now than at any time since World War
II.

	Is there a different ""angle"" to the story of a world full of bloody conflict?
 Yes, there is. It has nothing to do with covering yet another conference of
world leaders or yet another round of failed Arab-Israeli negotiations.  This
""angle"" would require a journalist to think ""outside the box"" in a very big way,
for the perspective we are talking about is not the world's perspective, but
Heaven's perspective.

	Suspend your natural skepticism for a moment and consider this: On October 13,
1917, some 70,000 people gathered in a muddy field in Fatima, Portugal, to witness
what three little children said would be a miracle at noon that day. Precisely
at the moment predicted, the huge crowd saw the sun spin in the sky, throw off
unimaginable colors and then plunge toward the earth, only to return to its normal
position in the sky.  The muddy field became bone dry in an instant, as did the
rain-soaked crowd. Secular newspapers, including the New York Times, reported
the event.  Warner Brothers later made a movie based upon it.  Everyone in that
crowd-believers and non-believers alike-experienced the Miracle of the Sun that
day.  There is no precedent in world history for a public miracle whose occurrence
was precisely predicted three months in advance.

	What was the point of the Miracle of the Sun?  It was a sign given to authenticate
what the three children had been told by the Blessed Virgin Mary in a series
of earlier apparitions in that very same field.  The children asked the Virgin
to provide a Miracle so the people would believe what She had told them.

	And what the Virgin told them was this: God will grant peace to the world when
Russia is solemnly and publicly Consecrated to the Virgin Mary by the Pope, together
with all the Catholic bishops of the world.  But the Virgin also warned that
if the Consecration is not done, Russia would spread its errors throughout the
world, there would be wars and persecutions, and that, ultimately, ""various nations
will be annihilated.""

	Weeks before the Russian revolution of 1917, the Virgin of Fatima accurately
predicted the end of World War I, the emergence of world communism, the election
of Pope Pius XI, the beginning of World War II and worldwide persecution of the
Catholic Church by communist regimes, which continues today. So far, the accuracy
of the Fatima predictions is 100%.

	No wonder Pope John Paul II has personally attested to the authenticity of the
Message of Fatima.  Indeed, the Pope escaped death at the hands of an assassin
on the very anniversary of the first Fatima apparition. Even Newsweek magazine,
in a cover story on the Virgin Mary, recognized the relation of the Fatima events
to the collapse of communism in Russia.  Yet, for various reasons, the Consecration
of Russia called for by the Virgin at Fatima remains undone, and the collapse
of communism has not brought peace to the world. Given the utter accuracy of
the Virgin's predictions, can the world simply ignore Her warning about the annihilation
of nations?

	Conventional thinkers may scoff at such things as miracles and apparitions of
the Virgin Mary. But today, the cause of world peace requires the setting aside
of such prejudices.  It requires the courage to admit that man must look to a
power greater than himself and to a source beyond the limitations of earthly
reality.

	This is your invitation to attend and cover an important conference on the Message
of Fatima and its utmost relevance to the quest for world peace, now more urgent
than ever before. From October 7th to 13th, 2001, at the Catholic University
of the Sacred Heart in Rome, dignitaries and speakers from around the world will
consider how Heaven's plan for peace can be accomplished now, while there is
yet time.

We are now mailing out conference information packages and written invitations.

3578,"Last Friday, Patricia Arce, (Mario Arce's daughter and a full time  ASMAE 
employee) was expressing her [distorted] views  to the press on why 
generating companies should not abide by Annex V. She was not speaking on 
behalf of ASMAE: however, she was probably reflecting ASMAE view. 

I did not mean to shoot the messenger, but I could not refrain myself from 
expressing an opposite opinion.

There are two problems in Patricia's view:

1) She is not supposed to express any views on contracts. MAE should only 
settle contracts, but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract 
disputes. The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAE's 
frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II - Furnas conflict in the last 6 
months.  Informativo Regulat?rio # 4 explores the issue in more detail.

2) She was dead wrong. Quite na<ve arguments. 



A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V (we may use externally, 
as you see fit)

1) Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts.
 * So what? It is a regulated contract by nature, as so many others, such as 
CUST, CUSD, CCT, CCD. Does it mean that parties signing those other 
agreements should not abide by their clauses?

2) Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions
 * So what? I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement 
without any chance to negotiate its terms (it is by definition an adhesion 
contract). Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement 
provisions? Guess what the answer was? None

3) Some Gs did not sign Annex V - e.g. Furnas, which [apparently] disobeyed 
Annel's instructions (as per Law 9.648/98)
 *  This is serious
 *  That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract, those Gs do not 
want to abide by Law? No response

4) Some companies do not have Annex V
 * So what? Discussion is about Annex V
 * Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts

6) Ttariff (energy price) was not subject to negotiation as part of the 
Initial Contracts - therefore, they were not able to price the risk 
represented by Annex V
 *  So what?
 *  Many contracts have regulated prices. All use of system contracts have 
regulated prices.
 *  Furthermore, the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V 
risk. Why giving them a windfall now? (Since it is a zero sum game, a 
windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors)

7) Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing: it was designed to 
mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch
 * Wrong
 *  ERM (Mecanismo de Realoca??o de Energia) was the mechanism put in place 
to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool 
operation
 *  Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing. It is called ""dry 
period relief"" clause. It was proposed by the generators and approved by 
Annel. The spot price is a ""proxy"" for the depth of rationing. One should not 
evoke rationing.


I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is 
""bullet proof"". In the meantime, let me share my views:

 * There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on 
the [ridiculous] proposal made by generators that merchant plants should 
collect part in cash and part of their sales in [junk] bonds. We should make 
this clear at the outset. 

 *  We should make Minister Patente realize  that Mario Arce's proposal is 
non-sense. Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices  is 
a bad precedent. No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known 
risks. A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and 
Fonte-Cindam (and became a public scandal) .  If we do want to create a 
market , we need to have responsible contracting. Irresponsible contracting 
should not be forgiven. If we do it, we will create a bad precedent and a 
poor environment for contracting. We have to show Minister Parente that 
irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates (no caps on 
spot). Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity. Breaching contracts 
will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs. Crisis will get worse and 
worse.

 *  Generators should have the burden of proof.  In the meantime, Annex V is 
effective and should be enforceable

 * Regarding California case, as mentioned by Mario Arce: It is a totally 
different situation. In California D/Cs were not allowed to contract. In 
Brazil they were strongly encouraged. Generators who signed Annex V could 
also have hedged their residual risks on Annex V.They did not. They acted 
irresponsibly. They second-guessed regulations. They did not help in 
expanding capacity. They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex 
V. 

 *  The argument ""no one should lose, no one should gain"" during rationing is 
inconsistent with market signals. Some one has to lose, some one has to gain 
by definition. And [hopefully] someone has to go bankrupt. This will be a 
great lesson. People will start taking market signals more seriously. 
Otherwise, there will never be expansion and there will never be a market.

 *  We have to be as transparent as possible.

Finally, I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V 
and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week. 

I volunteer to prepare a first draft, if you guys agree it is a good idea.

I'm looking forward to seeing you on the 21st and getting somewhat caught 
up.  I thought that it might be helpful to you to let you know what I have 
been thinking about in terms of work, although I would ask that you keep this 
confidential until we have had a chance to talk further and make some 
decisions.

First, if I do return to work, it will not be until sometime in January and 
you and I can talk about a date that makes sense.  I think that this is 
consistent with what we had talked about before I left.

Second, I would like for you to give some thought to the idea of me working 
part-time for a period of time.  Bill and I have talked about this alot, and 
I feel that I need some time at the outset to make the transition from what I 
have been doing to going back to work.  We can discuss further what this 
means, but I really feel that it would not be good for me or my family for me 
to start off working full time.

Next, I would like to talk with you about what my responsibilities would be 
in the swap group if I return and have a clearer understanding of the areas 
in which you would want me to work, particularly now that we have more 
people.     I know that alot of chnages have occurred in the last few months 
and I'm hoping that there are specific work areas that I could devote my 
attention to.

attached advice letter.  If approved, SDG&E would be authorized to transfer
a $104 million overcollection in its TCBA to its Energy Rate Ceiling Revenue
Shortfall Account (the account established to record the revenue shortfall
from the implementation of AB 265).  The $104 million represents the
overcollection in utility retained generation revenues allocated to
customers which did not come under the AB 265 rate ceiling. That group would
include direct access customers.  SDG&E's rationale for the transfer is that
it is the legislature's intent that 100% of SDG&E's retained generation be
used to serve its 100 kW and below customers (i.e., the AB 265 customers).
SDG&E had advanced this theory in its recent rate design case.  It was
opposed by several groups and has not been ruled on by the Commission.

I will be traveling back from CA tomorrow so I can't make the call.  Some things to be aware of --

1.	EES/EEMC v. SCE Complaint

We filed Aug 30 before the CPUC asking the CPUC to re-instate our customer net bill amounts.  Jeff Dasovich will call John Fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case (or at least delay until after legislative session).  If complaint moves forward, SCE will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes.  Enron is preparing similar filing for PG&E, although we need to seek Relief from the Stay.  

2.	California Legislation

SCE MOU bill (that includes DA issues) moved Aug 29 through Assembly Energy Committee.  Needs to go to Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week.  By removing the conservation easements, the bill has lost some liberal Democrats.  Governor Davis is asking Business to find 15+ Republicans to move the bill.  Trying to modify (1) surcharge effective date to Sept 1+ and (2) get more comfort that SCE will pay our Negative CTC if $$ exists.

Also, the Windfall Profits bill has moved through Assembly Committee.  It has to go through Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Jennifer Thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached.

 

3.	AG Subpeona / Sen Dunn Subpeona

Litigation about both Subpeonas was heard this week in SF and Sacramento.  Mike Kirby believes that he may have swayed the Court in the Sen Dunn to provide a protective order.  A final decision may be issued next week.

4.	FERC Refund Case

Enron presented its ""ripple"" claim earlier this week.  Range of refunds (non-netted) is very large (please see Bob Frank for exact $$).  I have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by Alan Comnes.  Oral testimony is being prepared in PNW case for next week.

 

5.	NE RTO Mediation / SE RTO Mediation

Both proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the ALJ issues a recommendation next week (or soon thereafter).  Looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single NE RTO energy market is Nov 03 (PJM thinks it can happen by May 03 but wants some cushion).  Sarah Novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier.  Also, ICAP and control area consolidation is not considered at this time.  Christi Nicolay believes that the ALJ will recommend moving toward a PJM model.

6.	CPUC Decision to Suspend DA Retroactive

Sue Mara continues to push the CPUC to remove the retroactive date in the current Proposed Decision.  Some rumors that the CPUC will again delay a decision until Sept 13 (confirming so please keep close).

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

""HARBOR"" came across as ""HARBORCOG"" and ""SierraPowe"" came across as ""SIERRAPWR.""  This is only an issue b/c our lookup tables search for specific names.

There still seems to be an issue with the PMI data pulling in every morning.  The Forecast and DayAhead data has not been coming in on a consistent basis.  Basically every morning,  I have had to run the ISO crawler/CAPS Import tool in order to pull in the data.  This seems to do the trick so I am curious as to why the job that runs every morning is not picking up the data.  This has been taking 20-30 minutes for me to pull in the data in the morning and it would be great if I could decrease this time.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

We have prepared an estimate of your taxes owing in the US April 16th given
the information you have provided to us and recommend that you make a
$20,000 payment to the IRS on or before that date.

I will fax an extension form to you along with instructions as to where you
should file it.  The extension, if filed timely, gives us until August 15th
to submit your tax return to the IRS but we would like to have it completed
by April 30th, the Canadian filing deadline, as we are also filing a
Canadian tax return for you (I believe we discussed this previously).
Please confirm that your fax number is 713-646-3390 and if you have any
special instructions before I send the fax.

 I have attached a generic term sheet as a starting point for an opportunity 
we have discussed with Nuclear Management Company.  Any and all of these 
points included in the terms sheet are subject to change (in particular, the 
intra-day discussion).  

Background info on NMC is as follows: 

  Nuclear Management Company Llc (NMC)
 joint venture between -- NSP, Alliant, WEPCO and WPS
 services provided -- manage the companies (noted above) 7 nuclear facilities 
(5 sites)
 The Facilities are as follows:
Point Beach Units 1&2, owned by WEPCO, located in east central Wisconsin (30 
miles SE of Green Bay), mW 523 and 500 mW respectively
Kewaunee, owned by WPS, located 27 miles SE of Green Bay, mW 511
Prarie Island Units 1&2, owned by NPS, located in Red Wing, MN, mW560 and 500 
mW respectively
Monticello Unit 1, owned by NPS, located 30 miles NW of Minneapolis, mW 536
Duane Arnold, owned by Alliant (IES Utilities), located 8 miles NW of Cedar 
Rapids, mW 515
Michigan nuclear facility (no details)


They are looking for a physical hedge (they suggested a 600 mW gas fired 
peaking facility) but may be receptive to a financial hedge (especially for 
the Michigan site) as well.  Or, a combination.  I would like to explore 
leveraging the Arpin site if we could but at this time I want to hold off 
from mentioning the site since it is part owned by Great Rivers Energy.  They 
want ownership (percentage or all) of the gas fired facility.  Based on the 
geographic location of the facilities noted above, the Arpin site should work 
well.  I would imagine they have firm service for those sites and if they are 
looking for the gas fired facility to take up the slack when these units are 
out, we should not have a problem with transport from the Arpin site (even 
though there is a west to east issue).

They would also like to market the gas fired facility when the unit is not 
needed as a backstop!  From a physical plant standpoint -- I would suggest 
that we carve out the development with a slight ownership that has a put 
option (for the equity we retain) at a future date (but retain a percentage 
of the marketing arrangement for sale of excess power in the market).  I 
think NMC wants complete control based on their view of deregulation in 
Wisconsin.  I believe their long term strategy is to have a PPA with the 
above Utilities for the offtake (firm output w/ firm price) and the ability 
to market the excess (from both the Nuclear Units and peaking facility) at 
market rates. 

This arrangement should be able to flange well with a financial insurance 
product (since the addition of the gas fired facility would provide more 
liquidity) that I have discussed with the Mid-Market Group (Terri Clynes and 
Doug Sewell).

Let's arrange a time when we can discuss at your convenience.  Thanks, Ron.

3659,"Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

it says my investments and balances are zero, so I assume I need to enroll in 
this myself if I want to be a part of it. The plan I'm referring to allows 
you to invest up to 15% of your before-tax income in either Enron Corp stock 
or a variety of mutual funds. In this plan, up to 6% of your contributions 
are matched by Enron, beginning one month after your hire date. I guess my 
question is - What is this plan called? And if I enroll in it myself online, 
will I be doubling up on something Enron has already done for me? If this is 
not the retirement plan, what is?

I'm sorry to ask so many trivial questions. I just want to make sure I've 
taken advantage of all the programs and not neglected opportunities because I 
thought they were automatically given to me.

not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct=20
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business=20

received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but you=

standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length=20

3797,"I just sent Kroum a little missive on our familiarity with the ""killed"" 
feature, as well as why we often zero out deals (Transmission in particular) 
in scheduling only. If I have to teach a course on scheduling for him to 
understand how to build this report I will do it, but I am not really dying 
to do that.

As far as our situation here, If you can properly kill a deal, you should do 
that instead of just zeroing the volume. I quite often have great success 
having many terminal server sessions open at once, and doing the slow stuff 
through a few different channels of TS.  Even as we speak, I am running one 
report for 6 different months, 1 in each of the 5 terminal severs, and one 
locally.  I learned that trick in our old winframe system, and it has served 
me well.

I have torn my hair out over this cross-portfolio vs cross-desk thing.  I 
have explained it to both Kroum, Duong Luu, and Will each at least 3 times.  
How hard is it to get the concept that anything we sell to ourselves is not a 
physical deal?

I would say just keep sending them to me, so we don't all have to pull our 
collective hairs out. The deal you reference below is kind of like a life 
preserver thing. When the market makes a sudden move, it is sometimes faster 
to 'hit' the deal through EOL then pull it on the traders side.  It's not the 
best way to go, but better than losing a bunch of money.

I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own

group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, 
SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to 
include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. 
While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, 
she said. 

I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our 
real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in 
Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to ""no confirm,"" but until

3838,"Here's the solution I came up with. It will only take a few more minutes each 
day, but I think it will make the EOL summary more relevant. Please let me 
know if this plan suits you - 

1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with 
EES sleeves. If I take the EES deals out of this table, I have to adjust the 
total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not 
sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because 
I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.

2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this 
count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce 
a more accurate rendering of the day's activities.

I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should 
solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado.

As far as Vietnam vacations go, I don't see one in my near future. First of 
all, I find it difficult to take either one of you seriously - your favorite 
phrases are ""baby"" and ""poppa"" for god's sake. Secondly, I have about 10

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your

man parked outside my office incessantly tooting ""Jingle Bell Rock"" on his 
horn? When will I ever see my bare feet again? How annoying is it that I 
began this e-mail with lines of whining?

I hope the holidays are at least a somewhat more sincere experience in 
Vietnam than they are here. I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in 
years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of 
the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting 
to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless 
e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, 
but that's what makes everyday interesting.

Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot. Thanksgiving was nice - 
saw a lot of friends from out of town and had enough meals with the family to 
satisfy, but not overwhelm, the quality time scale. Our office had its big 
holiday bash last weekend, which I kicked off the night before for no 
apparent reason and just continued the festivities for about 48 nonstop 
hours. There's snow on the mountain, so this weekend I might have to break in 
(or break, whichever comes first) my new snowboard.

Hope all's well on the other side of the world. It's kind of comforting to 
remind myself every once in awhile that there is another side, full of people 
who could care less about power trading and Portland, Oregon. By the way, I 
heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full. Good or bad? 
Or ugly?

Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance. I'm out of here on the 22nd,

3882,"I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be 
caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times 
over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk 
have entered off peak deals by choosing the ""off"" selection under the ""Hours"" 
heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the 
traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then 
is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and 
Holidays, round-the-clock hours.

My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it

get in on the bargain at the last minute, and as it turns out, finding a 
3-bedroom house is a lot easier and cheaper than a 2-bedroom. We found three

As far as Vietnam vacations go, I don't see one in my near future. First of 
all, I find it difficult to take either one of you seriously - your favorite

the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that 
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes 
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since 
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you

I am unsure as to what Mike Dahlke is referencing when utilizing the term 
""Business Model Patent"".  If you believe it appropriate, perhaps you could 
clarify this with him.

I note, that yesterday I was requested by Mike Grimes to join in on a 
conference call that was in progress.  The question that Jae Moo had raised 
was as to whether we could state to the Korean authorities that the Japanese 
authorities had arrived at the conclusion that weather derivatives should be 
categorized as a  commodity derivative, as opposed to a financial 
derivative.  I informed the participants on the call that in Japan, weather 
derivatives are considered financial in nature, most analagous under the 
Japanese regulatory framework to FX and interest rate transactions. The basis 
for this, is that there can be no physical delivery with a weather 
derivative, as would be possible in a commodity type transaction, therefore 
resulting in the classification of a financial derivative.

If I may be of further assistance, please contact me.  My office phone number 
in Tokyo is 81-3 5219-4578.

Justin, I would assume that the form of ETA that EOL currently uses for a

For weather derivatives conducted by Enron North America with counterparties 
in Japan:

1.  There is a ""relatively low risk"" (quoting Baker & McKenzie) that such 
transactions will be considered gambling in Japan.  However, such risk is 
deemed to be even lower, when utilizing an offshore entity.  The risk has 
been determined to be sufficiently low to utilize Enron Japan Corp. as the 
Enron entity engaging in these transactions, therefore utilizing ENA should 
also be acceptable.

2.  I note, there will be foreign exchange reporting requirements for the 
Japanese counterparty to the transaction, both at the time the transaction is 
entered into and each time a payment is made (or netted).  There are no 
Japanese reporting requirements applicable to Enron North America.  Further, 
a default by the Japanese counterparty in compliance with its reporting 
requirements will not effect the enforceability of the transaction.

3.  I have copied Susan Musch on this correspondence, to obtain her input 
from the tax perspective.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

modify the threshold level to be counterparty specific.  However, I question 
whether taking the threshold level to zero might prove to be too low a

triggered by some nonmaterial disputed debt?  If having a bilateral zero

the broker acts as principal and must itself be EOL pre-approved
the broker will seek to novate the trade to the specified counterparty (who 
must be EOL pre-approved in relation to the underlying product)
on novation (if at all), the broker is released as principal and the 
specified counterparty is substituted therefor
if no novation occurs, the broker is liable as principal and any cash-out 
should be calculated on market-based principles

 I am correct in understanding there can be different versions of the  
Password Agreement and Electronic Trading Agreement?  I have seen Password 
Agreement NA Version 1and an Electronic Trading Agreement Version 1 that both 
have Enron North America Corp and/or its affiliates as the Enron contracting 
party.  In Australia we will have to enter into  electricity derivatives 
through the Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.(EAF)  which is the only Enron 
entity authorised trade in these products. Would EAF also be a party to a 
Password Agreement and ETA with its potential counterparties?
If  I  was starting with a clean sheet in drafting GTCs for Australian 
financial power trades I would incorporate into it the  1992 ISDA Master 
Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)and as well as the 1993 Commodity 
Definitions. This is what Australian counterparties would expect to see. 
However, I notice this approach has not been followed with any of the GTCs I 
have seen. The closest is the incorporation  EFA terms  for the UK power 
contracts. I suppose this raises a general question are there any established 
protocols for drafting GTCs? 
Small point - I notice the limitation of liability clauses in all the 
documentation follows the US form.  I notice even for contracts interpreted 
under English law there is an exclusion of ""special damages"".  In Australia 
and I thought England special damages were defined money damages that must be 
specially damages as opposed to general damages such as pain and suffering 
that cannot be quantified and are assessed by the court. This is completely 
different  to the meaning of this term in US. Has this issue been considered 
and for whatever reason a decision has been made to go with the US wording?  
How much work have we done on issues such as those relating to formation of 
contracts? I note it was excluded from the scope of your surveys of the 
various European jurisdictions. I am taking my brief to include those issues 
relevant which are material to ensure that Enron is complying with the law 
and will also have enforceable agreement. This may go wider than just 
regulatory compliance issues.

FROM:	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	Delivery Procedures


The Exchange proposes to amend the delivery rules for the metals futures
contracts by making permanent the temporary emergency rules enacted by the
NYMEX Board of Directors as a result of the attack on the World Trade
Center.  The proposed rule amendments would permit deliveries against the
COMEX Division's Gold, Silver and Grade 1 Copper Futures Contracts and the
NYMEX Division's Platinum and Palladium Futures Contracts to take place at
such location as may be mutually agreed upon by the Clearing Member taking
delivery and the Clearing Member making delivery.

The proposed rule amendments must be approved by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (""CFTC"").  The Exchange Membership will be notified upon
receipt of CFTC approval.

A copy of the proposed rule amendments is attached.

Should you have any questions please contact Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608
or Nick Galati at 212-299-2920.

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange. ",J. Robert Collins Jr.,"half billion dollars $3

3952,"Mr. Taylor:
1)  The allowable data is generally unique to each permit.  Because of this a general statement like ""the allowable tons/year for SO2 in Harris County is ......."" would not be defendable or valid.  
2)  I believe that the allowable data varies in relation to the season of year and part of the state - a.k.a., ""ambient background threshold"".   In other words, if it is ozone season, allowable emissions probably would be lower.  
3)  The allowable emissions threshold is also variable over time.  25 years ago, Harris county probably did not need an allowable cap for certain emissions.  As industry grows the allowable emissions will be adjusted.  The period of time for the data to become outdated could be as little as 1 month, depending on when new allowables or new permits are initiated.  
4)  Texas charges corporations a ""tax"" for emissions over their allowable limit.  It is sort of a pay-as-you-go plan.  Of course I am being very simplistic here, but the point is still the same.  

Your questions are excellent and I am giving you as specific an answer as possible.  I hope I am not being too pointed but to the data oriented person, the previous points are important for data integrity.  Jim Parks

College, specifying that the gift be applied toward the college's $5.5
million campaign to completely renovate Hewes Library.
""We're pleased and grateful that the Caterpillar Foundation has provided us
with this magnificent gift,"" said college president Richard F. Giese. ""This
will help us realize our goal of providing future Monmouth College students
with a library that is second to none and allow them access to the most
advanced learning tools possible.""
Work is expected to begin this summer on the renovation, which will entail
an extensive update of the building's technological capabilities. Library
experts believe the library of the future will be more reliant on
technology, with increasing amounts of data and information stored on and
accessed with computers. Hewes Library currently has a traditional design,
as it was built before the advent of electronically-stored information. The
renovation will make the building more accessible to technology, creating a
new high-tech electronic classroom and study areas with Internet
connections.
The plans also include a significant redesign of the building, providing a
library that is more aesthetically pleasing. The changes will enhance the
atmosphere in the library by adding air conditioning and will provide more
exterior light by adding new windows and skylights. Other major improvements
include a new entrance on the east side of the building and completion of
the third floor, which was left unfinished during the original construction.
In addition, a new coffee shop is planned for the current Pi Beta Phi Lounge
to make the library a social center as well as a learning center, and the
first two floors will be completely remodeled.

I seem to recall from our earlier conversation that London can trade on the 
PULPEX but cannot trade as a marketmaker.  That can only be done out of 
Houston.  Is this understanding correct? and if so, why is that?  The reason 
why I ask is that eventually we would like to move the marketmaking function 
over to London.

3957,"Fascinating.

A few questions come to mind:

1) Has an auction transaction agreement been developed? 

2) Harry, have we checked with Mark Perlis yet on any emission legal issues, 
such as can we offer an auction that competes arguable with the EPA Auction?

3) It appears as though this is going to be both a system that allows Enron 
to buy and sell with other participants, as well as allows others to deal 
with each other through the system.  I would be my understanding that only 
physical delivery would occur in this market. Mark, do you think this 
(particularly the matching aspects of the auction) may be construed as a 
""multilateral execution facility"" by the CFTC? I could not recall if that 
interpretation would be a problem for a physical delivery market; I know it 
would likely be for swaps.

4) Does Enron get any commission for playing running the system when others 
transaction without Enron being a principal?

5) I have no idea about the legality of offering up the Las Vegas trip. But, 
it seems as though we would need to review all relevant jurisdictions where 
the participants reside for an answer.

our legal entity structures (thus far) for the Enron Net Works ""family"".  
There has been a fair amount of entity formation (and, perhaps, commercial

3960,"Thanks for the feedback on the ISDA I got from Alan and Shari. I perhaps did 
not put the suggested changes in the ISDA Schedule in their full context. 
Recently we have received 2 ISDAs which included provisions that incorporate 
by reference Australian Addendum that relate to FX, currency and interest 
products and the like. Normally we only reference the Addenda that relate to 
electricity and commodities. The ralionale for seeking of this alternative 
ISDA form was to allow us the discretion have these provisions remain whilst 
following an agreed Enron trading form. Whilst EAPL is not authorised to 
trade these products we would have the flexibility to do so if the situation 
were to change in the future.  By way of comparison we include provisions to 
allow trading in respect of non-electricity commodities but do not do so.

Anyway as Shari and I discussed perhaps it is better that we drop the 
amendments to produce an alternative Australia ISDA with a broader scope.  l

3962,"ENA is proceeding with a number of volumetric production payment 
transactions.  Generally, the producer will want to establish the pricing 
through a swap mechanism prior to the actual closing of the VPP and prior to 
the syndication of the VPP.   For example, Preston Exploration entered into a 
swap last Friday with ENA to establish the VPP pricing on a transaction to be 
closed this week.  At the VPP closing the Preston position in the swap will 
be transferred to ECT Merchant Investments Corp. (a wholly owned sub of ENA 
and VPP buyer); therefore, the swap counterparties will then be ECTMI and 
ENA.  As the VPP is syndicated (planned prior to year end), the original 
Preston swap position will be further assigned/restated to the syndicate VPP 
buyer (generally a Texas LP 99.9999% owed by an unrelated Trust).  Upon the 
last transfer, the swap will not be between two Enron subs.

Based upon viewing other VPP structures, it is my understanding that these 
swaps do not need the RMT  tax treatment since the swap is carried as an 
affiliate swap only as an interim step.  Please advise.  I will be preparing 
the swaps on the basis of the foregoing absent your direction otherwise.

As noted in my voice mail, I also need to visit with you about RMT in 
general.  Thanks. Mary.

In the DocSwapLogic we probably need to add in the ability to do online 
negotiations and signing.  This is contemplated but not part of the current 
development only because of the anticipated launch date of July 17.  Let me 
know what you think.

Also, we need to move forward with BankLogic.

Also, I spoke to Mark Taylor earlier in the week about the status of ""EOL"" as 
a shorthand means of referring to EnronOnline.  I had understood that there 
was a move being made to obtain this mark or to register this so that we 
could use it.  In speaking with Mark Holsworth, I understand you may have

Looks good.  The product description looks fine for copying the shipping 
products that Scott Moncrieff is trading now in London.

I'm a little concerned about the line: ""Each calendar month during the term 
of the Transaction will be a Determination Period""...

Is it flexible enough in changing determination periods from mid-month to 
mid-month?
As in June 15 to July 14 to represent a month?  Or will that just be another 
Long Description that we would have to draft for another product type?

Also, what if we wanted to break up the determination periods into smaller 
increments than one month?  
Let us say a 1-week or 2-week period instead of a full month.

May be something like:
""Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period unless otherwise specified by the Effective Dates""

That's my two cents,

As I mentioned one of our hedgefund counterparties has suggested the=20
following change to our representation.

""(ii) it is not any employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retiremen=
t=20
Income Security Act of 1974 (=01&ERISA=018), is not acting on behalf of an =
employee=20
benefit plan subject to ERISA, and not more than 24.9% of its assets areis=
=20
not using assets which are or which are deemed under ERISA to be assets of =
an=20
employee benefit plan.""

The following paragraphs are two explanations on why they want this change.

...we have counsel tracking down the cite, but I think your expert is
mixing two different issues.  We are not obliged to get exception from a
""prohibited transaction"" because we are NOT an employee benefit plan.  If
more than 25% of your assets are employee benefit assets you are deemed to
be a plan - which is why we have a limitation up to that amount.  It is
clearly our intention to not be considered a employee benefit plan fiduciar=
y
and the 25% test is one of the criteria for this.

The cite is 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, which is a Department of Labor
regulation generally referred to as the ""plan asset regulation"".  The plan
asset regulation states that a fund is not deemed to hold plan assets (and
therefore is not subject to the prohibited transaction rules under ERISA) i=
f
benefit plans investors in the aggregate hold less than 25% of each class o=
f

the fund and its affiliates)

  . . . from the President's Office

Issue 4, March 1, 2001

All of us here at Monmouth College send our warmest regards, and I want to
share with you some of the exciting things that are currently happening on
campus.

 * The curriculum review, endorsed by the Board and funded by
the Teagle Foundation of New York City, is gaining impetus.  In April,
George Dehne, a nationally known marketing consultant, will be on campus to
meet with the Curriculum Planning Committee and make a presentation to the
entire faculty.    My hope is that he will sensitize all of us to the market
needs that are out there and focus our curriculum review.  Mr. Dehne will
also meet with the Admissions staff as a follow-up to our discussion at the
Trustee retreat regarding the enhancement of our college marketing efforts.

 * Also, plans are in the works for a two-day faculty planning
retreat following commencement.  We will be using Dr. Ron Purser, the
consultant who worked with us at the Trustee retreat in Indian Wells, to
facilitate our discussions.  We hope to begin to build some consensus for
needed curricular changes based on some of the marketing forces identified
in Dehne's visit.

 * This past weekend, a student written and produced play,
""Lincoln's Lagoon,"" by senior Matt Fotis was performed in Wells Theatre.
Matt's play received excellent reviews in the campus Courier and the local
Monmouth Review Atlas, and many positive comments from the community.

 * The Nominations Committee will be presenting the following
individuals for election to our Board at our spring Trustees' meeting:

   * Mrs. Elizabeth Hiel, a former president of
our Parent's Association and mother of two Monmouth College graduates.  The
Hiels own and operate Hiel Trucking Company, Hiel Enterprises Inc., and
Prairie Equipment Inc. They reside in Prairie City, Illinois.
   * Attorney Mark Taylor, Class of 1978, a
resident of Houston, Texas.  He is Assistant General Counsel for Enron
Capital Trade Resources. Mark has also served MC in the past as a member of
the Alumni Board.
   * The Hon. Daniel S. Weber, Class of 1974, a
felony trial judge in Cook County Circuit Court. Dan will serve as an Alumni
Board representative.  He resides in Westchester, Illinois.

 * The Whiteman Lecture will be held on Thursday, April 19 at
11:00 AM.  This is the day before the spring Board meeting begins, and all
are encouraged to attend what I am sure will be a very interesting address.
The speaker is Walter Huff '56, our Board Vice Chair, and founder of HBO &
Company.  Walter joins a long list of distinguished Whiteman lecturers,
which includes Jim Pate '63, Pennzoil Company; Red Poling '49, Ford Motor
Company; Lee Morgan, Caterpillar Inc.; Leonard Hadley, Maytag Corp.; and
Jerry Porras, Stanford University, among others.

 * We are in the midst of completing a number of faculty
searches.  We already have signed contracts for new faculty in Philosophy
and Religious Studies, Psychology, Sociology, and Plant Biology.  We are
still in the interview phase for hires in Marketing, Molecular Biology, and
Physical Education/Coaching.  We are pleased to have rich pools in these
searches, and we have been able to attract top candidates.

 * Construction/renovation plans for the library, the athletic
and recreation center, the auditorium, and the main dining room in the
Stockdale Center continue.  We want to be able to move quickly as funding
becomes available.  We hope to begin the library renovation this summer, as
well as the remodeling of our food service and the renovation of the locker
rooms and training rooms in Wade Gymnasium in anticipation of the new
construction.

 * The new residence hall construction is progressing nicely,
and plans to open in the fall are on schedule.  I can't wait for you to see
this outstanding facility at the spring meeting.

 * Eleven houses are scheduled to be demolished this spring on
the north and west boundaries of the campus.  Plans are also underway to
construct six competition tennis courts west of the new track facility.

 * The silent phase of the capital campaign is moving forward.
The Trustee Steering Committee has been active and will soon be making
arrangements for solicitation of the Board.  A number of very generous
commitments have already been made, and a progress report will be given at
the April meeting.

 * Admissions is moving along at an encouraging pace. The
following is a comparison of visits, applications, accepteds, and deposits
(as of February 26), for 1999, 2000, and 2001.  If we attain a class of 350,
with our projected retention, we should be nearing 1,100 for opening
enrollment next fall.

2000 711 1057 785 136 350
1999 702 1060 748 118 337

 * And, just to keep you up-to-date with a couple of our
distinguished emeritus faculty, Dr. Bernice Fox, Classics Department,
celebrated her 90th Birthday February 19; and Gracie Peterson, Theatre
Department, will celebrate her 99th Birthday on March 2.

Mark Taylor asked me to forward a sample OTC Weather Derivative Confirmation 
in a Deemed ISDA format for use in connection with your On-Line Trading 
Project.  Attached please find a template for a Single Season CDD Cap Option 
Confirmation which we would use with a US Corporate Counterparty with whom no 
ISDA is in place and no credit support is required. 



Please note that is the most ""plain vanilla"" version we use and depending 
upon the counterparty, it may need credit support language or additional 
representations (if CP is a non-corporate). If the counterparty is foreign, 
we would of course need the appropriate tax annex.   

I imagine this will serve as a starting point. Please let me know if you have 
questions or would like to see confirmations for  other types of weather 
derivatives.

Kind regards, 

Shari

4001,"This was forwarded to me by Paul Kaufman 

Today's GD reports that the Colorado PUC is seeking public comments on policy changes necessary to provide price stability for customers.  The article states that the PUC is seeking comments on 3 methods:  (1) requiring utilities to hedge more of their gas supply; (2) requiring utilities to offer an optional service that would be less volatile than standard offer service; and (3) implementing gas unbundling to give customers supplier choice. 

Apparently, the Commission has received comments from the state's LDCs (and maybe others, although the article didn't speak to them).  It is asking for another round of comments, which are due June 18th.

I recommend that we file comments which advocate our hedging proposal, including weather products.

4011,"Ahoy again,
Because of all the positive response, I called the  Windjammer Barefoot 
Cruise ?group department and negotiated a 20% savings  for two different 
cruises. 
?
LEGACY: October  28-November 3?cruise
**?Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Venezuela,  Aruba
??? Ensign Cabins  (bunks)??? Reg. $1000, our cruise, $800
??? Commodore (Double Bed)? Reg.  $1125, our cruise, $900??
????Port  charges,?????????????????  $90.00 
??? NO CHARGE FOR THE  STOWAWAY
??? Fare Share  will apply. It is $890 from PDX, will be less for those of 
you to the  East. Once you have made a deposit I can get the Fare Share rate 
from your  airport. ?
?
WJ is in the process of negotiating with hotels in Aruba. I  will not be 
doing group hotel arrangements; I will share info about  hotels, and those 
who want to stay over can do their own.
?
POLYNESIA: November 5-10  Repositioning Cruise (For those wanting to do a 
Back to Back)
**From St. Lucia to St. Maarten
Theme Cruise: Sea of Wellness,  
??? ??? with Massage  Therapists, Yoga, etc. 
?? ?Deck  Cabins,??????? Reg. $1100, our cruise,  $880
??? Standard Cabins,? Reg. $900,  our cruise:? $720
???  BQ,?????????????????????  Reg. $700, our cruise?? $560
??? Port  Charges?????? ?$65
?
THE CATCH: WJ group department will only  deal with one person, so all 
payments and questions have to?pass through  me. If we don't get 15 people, 
the rate reverts to the regular  rate. So, enlist your funnest?buddies to 
come along, too.  
?
HOW TO GET IN ON THE DEAL:
1). Decide which week(s) you want to sail
2). Send a $200 deposit for each cruise and $100 additional  if you plan to 
use Fare Share
??? Checks can be made out to WJ or to me,  and sent?to ??? me at: PO BOX 
1723, Newport, Oregon  97365
??? You can use your credit card.? Send  me the # and ??? expiration date, or 
you can give it to me on the  ??? ??? phone. My number is:  (541)765-4577. 
3). IF you want to use Fare Share, let me know which days  you want to arrive 
and depart, and from which airport.
?
Simple as 1-2-3.?

Looking forward to seeing you!

The difference between your price indications and EOL are twofold.  One, we are showing you physical markets on the price indications and EOL is strickly financial and for a specific product.  There are many differences in these two products, depending on term, physical premiums, the trader's position, etc.  Two, the price indications that you receive are based on yesterday's markets.  EOL is a real time current market price for the specific product listed.  Give me a call if you have any more questions and we can discuss further.

Following is the course information for Becoming an Exceptional Leader; As I thought, it begins the day after you come back from vacation.  There are (2) other offerings of this same course, same teacher.  You can log onto http:/elm.enron.com, and sign up for the one that suits your schedule.  One is offered October 31-November 2, and the other is November 19-21.  When you register, it will say there is a wait list.  However, they are in the process of adding a few more seats, so you would probably get in.

Butch Bentley, who is on the Panhandle Team, called me this morning and said he had heard on a local radio station that Duke had paid the city of Clovis, NM $50,000 for water rights for a 6 month period.  This sounds like Duke is again interested in building a power plant near Clovis.  About a year ago they were proposing a power plant South of Clovis about 2 miles from our Panhandle lateral.  The proposed plant would be gas fired with a fuel need of up to 100mmcfd.   Later I was told that the project was a dead issue because of problems getting water.
Butch will get a newspaper today and see if there's any more information.  This could be a good opportunity for us.  If you contact Duke, please let us know the results.
