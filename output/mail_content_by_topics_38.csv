I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

3,"A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray

Philip,

What is going on down the street?  Curious to hear any perspectives you may
wish to offer from the trading floor?  Enron stock is now lower than when I
joined the company out of business school.  I imagine there are quite a few
not so happy people these days.  We can relate somewhat over here at NPW
with a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago).  Knowing
you, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down
much.  I have taken a similar approach to our problems here at NPW.

Hope everything else is going well for you and the family.  Have you had
the knee surgery yet?  Give me a call when you have a chance.

Later,

Al Pollard

GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.

In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

30,"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for 
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list 
that I need further 
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this 
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash 
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash 
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the

UK: UK Coalpower keen for 500MW station at Hatfield.

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Coalpower, the company set up by former RJB Mining chief Richard Budge, says it would like to build a coal-fired power station near its newly acquired Hatfield colliery in South Yorkshire, northern England. 
""We are keen to build a 500 megawatt clean coal power plant and are talking to various people"", Budge told Reuters on Thursday, adding the chances of such a station coming to fruition would be closely linked to the outcome of Britain's current review of its energy needs to 2050.
""Let's see what comes out of the energy review - if it's positive for coal gasification it will not just be our plant that will be built, others will be."" 
Coalpower acquired the Hatfield coal mine on Monday, beating off competition from U.S. energy group Enron and UK Coal (formerly RJB Mining) and is spending about five million pounds ($8.4 million) to restart production. 
Budge said Hatfield has the potential to become a long-life pit with its 100 million tonnes of contiguous coal reserves and he is looking for output in excess of 500,000 tonnes a year. 
""Hatfield is the optimum site for a coal gasification combined cycle plant"", said Budge, adding Britain needed coal generation to maintain a balanced and diverse energy portfolio. 
The government has said it is concerned about Britain's projected dependence on imported natural gas. 
Conventional coal burning power stations are high in fossil fuel emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to global warming. But gasification combined cycle technology converts coal to a gaseous fuel from which most of the impurities are removed prior to combustion. 
Supporters of coal say the clean coal technology can address many of the environmental concerns of burning coal. 
Coal mining in Britain has been in decline for decades, but the fuel still accounts for about a third of its power generation and recent signs point to the industry enjoying a mini revival. 
A doubling in the price of British natural gas over the last year has led to a rise in coal demand as electricity generators seek out the cheapest fuel in a highly competitive market. The increased demand for coal has propelled prices to about 35 pounds a tonne compared with 22.50 #18 months ago.

Enron's Azurix faces damages claim if rescinds Buenos Aires water contract

10/12/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

BUENOS AIRES (AFX) - Enron Corp water and sewage unit Azurix Buenos Aires SA faces a claim for compensation unless it reverses plans to rescind its concession to provide the province's water and sewage services, financial daily Buenos Aires Economico reported. 
The damages claim would be filed by public prosecutor Ricardo Szelagowski, the newspaper cited provincial secretary for public services, Eduardo Sicaro, as saying.
Azurix said earlier this week it will rescind the concession on Jan 2, but continue operating the service ""until the provincial authorities, or the operator it designates, take charge of assets and operations"".

Enron backs away from Coburg plant

10/12/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

COBURG, Ore. (AP) - Enron will not be a partner in a proposed natural gas power plant here, the project's managing director said Thursday. 
But Gary Marcus, who owns Coburg Power, said losing the Texas-based conglomerate will not stop the project.
""Enron never drove this deal,"" he said. ""I invited Enron into the deal."" 
Marcus said Enron's participation improved the quality of the plant's design but slowed the decision-making process. Marcus predicted he will find a new backer in less than six months and will have a license to build the project within a year. 
Enron backed out because the project did not meet its market strategy, Marcus said. 
Enron officials couldn't be reached for comment. 
Enron's departure will do little to appease local residents, who fear that the power plant will harm ground water and air quality. 
""I don't think it'll ever be built,"" said Kent Johnston of Coburg, a project opponent. ""If the people of Coburg and Eugene have anything to say about it, it won't be."" 
Added Joey Gayles, a committee chairman in the residents' opposition group, ""We're going to fight (Marcus) tooth and nail."" 
The proposed 40-acre site north of Coburg meets all criteria for construction of a 300-megawatt plant on 12 acres of the site, Marcus said. The remainder of the site would be used for buffer area and wetlands mitigation. 
An additional eight acres will be required for the 600-megawatt plant that Coburg Power wants to build, he said. The larger plant would require additional permits that might delay the project. 
Expanding the existing natural gas pipeline that runs under the site also would add to the plant's cost. The larger plant would generate the equivalent of all power currently consumed in Lane County. 
Marcus estimated the cost of the larger plant at $300 million to $400 million. The smaller plant would cost about $180 million, he said.

UK Crt Blocks Challenge To Intl Arbitration In Enron Spat

10/12/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

BOMBAY (AP)--A Commercial Court in London has restrained an Indian state government from blocking international arbitration proceedings by the U.S. power giant Enron to recover claims of up to $5 billion, a company statement said Friday. 
""The injunction facilitates a timely and impartial review by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between the Dabhol Power Company and the Maharashtra state government,"" said the statement issued in Bombay, India's financial capital.
Wednesday's court injunction in London is expected to block the state government's move to settle the dispute in India through the state-owned Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission. 
Enron said the original contract for the disputed Dabhol power project required international arbitration. The company accused the state government of using a delaying tactic by trying to halt the international arbitration in favor of a settlement procedure in India. 
Enron has a 65% stake in the Dabhol Power Co. Its 2,184-megawatt power project is India's biggest foreign investment. In phase one of the project, Enron supplied electricity from naphtha for its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which has said it can't afford the prices negotiated seven years ago. 
The contract included a federal government guarantee to cover any nonpayment. Enron has said guarantee hasn't been met, despite two notices to the federal government. 
The second part of the project, more than 90% complete, involves building a new plant to produce electricity from liquefied natural gas, and a container ship port to import it. 
Houston-based Enron says it has halted construction for the second phase and it was costing hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Enron wants to pull out of India and recover its entire investment and that of its partners, General Electric and Bechtel Corp.

Hope you're well.

We are doing some work here on the long term curve for UK natural gas and 
would value your views on the long term NYMEX Nat gas curve.
By long term I am talking 7-20 years. 

Our thinking is that beyond the traded period of 5-10 years forward, UK 
prices would at least partially reflect the long run marginal cost of LNG in 
a ""globalised"" market provided US prices were not significantly above.

As we are currently working on some long term structured deals it would be 
great to get your input on this. 

Many thanks

Thanks for putting the paperwork together.  

I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment 
opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with 
financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual 
fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass 
off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above 
services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present opportunities 
such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong

buying on any pullbacks and selling on rallies that the market, with such a 
flat curve, is going nowhere.  That will change, but it's going to take a 
while.  I like it eventually.




",,,
111,"Andy:
Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.

+Montana Power Sells Oil and Gas Business Unit
The Montana Power Co. has sold for $475million (US) its nonregulated oil and
gas business unit to PanCanadian Petroleum Limited of Calgary. The sale
includes subsidiaries that have interests in crude oil, natural gas and gas
liquids exploration, production and marketing in the U.S. and Canada.

Proceeds from the sale would be invested in growing Touch America, MPC's
national fiber-optic and wireless broadband telecommunications subsidiary.
The U.S. businesses have operations in northern Montana and in the D-J
(Denver-Julesburg) Basin north of Denver as well as minor properties in the
Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma, and Green River Basin, Wyoming. Fractionation
plants are at Cut Bank, MT, and Ft. Lupton, CO. The Canadian properties
reside mostly in southern and central Alberta and in southern Saskatchewan.

+Deutsche Telekom to Buy Powertel for $5.89bn
The Financial Times said that Deutsche Telekom is expanding in the U.S.
mobile phone market by acquiring Powertel, a local mobile operator in the
Southeast, for about $5.89 billion in shares. The deal comes just weeks
after DT moved into the U.S. mobile market through the $50 billion
acquisition of VoiceStream.

As that deal has not yet been completed, the latest transaction is
structured as an all-share acquisition of Powertel by Voicestream. The two
U.S. companies have also agreed that the deal will go ahead even if DT's
takeover of VoiceStream is not completed.

Communications Holdings, Inc., a unit of SCANA Corp., owns approximately
14.6 million fully diluted
common shares, or about a 27% equity interest, in Powertel, representing an
investment of $249 million.

149,"Subject: FW: Aggies Demand a Recount

College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. ""The end
zones were confusing,"" says Slocum. ""I'm sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.

We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount.""

Oklahoma officials are calling this ""outrageous"". ""They agreed to the size,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,"" replies OU coach
Bob Stoops.  ""If they had a problem with them, they should have said so
before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with the
outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points many
times.""

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  ""We
are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of
the game,"" says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones
were used. ""They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,""
says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as, ""A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!"" Students' thoughts echoed
their signs. ""All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a
winner,"" says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.

""We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a
winner.""

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30
pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off its
prediction.

College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. ""We felt that with a
number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were
certain A&M would carry this game. We may have been premature in our
prediction.""",R.C. Slocum Slocum Bob Karen Hays Brent Musburger,,AP the Texas A&M Aggies A&M OU WHOOOOOOP aggie ABC Aggies

s=20
tendency to throw  to WR Willie Jackson.? We'll see if that continues.? Sur=
e,=20
he's a long  shot but if you're desperate for a QB, he could be a nice =20
surprise.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD)? Hold the  presses, Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade=
=20
list.? Seriously, he's an  easy target and I'll admit to taking my share of=
=20
shots but you can't deny the  guy has skills.? Yes, there were some fluky=
=20
plays with Crockett injuring  himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw=
.?=20
(although the 3 TDs on 13  completions did make for a wild looking box scor=
e=20
for Leaf)? He's got some  weapons in Jeff Graham, Curtis Conway and his bes=
t=20
receiver, TE Freddie  Jones.? He's as flaky as they come but he might be=20
worth a look if you're  dying at QB.

?

RBs Moving Up

RB Fred Taylor (Jac)? Taylor  put together one of the best performances of=
=20
the year Sunday night.? The  fact that he did it against the very tough rus=
h=20
defense of the Steelers makes it  even all the more impressive.? This isn't=
=20
like rolling up 200 yards on the  Cowboys or Cardinals.? Clearly, there's=
=20
reason for huge hope as if he can  do this against Pittsburgh, he can do it=
=20
against anyone.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? Once  again, Lewis ran hard.? He's got to be consider=
ed=20
one of the better RBs in  the game right now.? I still worry about how=20
durable he'll be but he's  looked great lately averaging 6.7 yards per carr=
y=20
Sunday for 187 yards.? If  it weren't for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturin=
g=20
a TD here and there, he'd be  even higher.

RB Darnell Autry (Phi)? Autry  refuses to hand over the #1 RB job to Stanle=
y=20
Pritchett or anyone else.?  He's not very flashy but he gets the job done=
=20
both rushing and receiving.?  The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in=
=20
the standings and Autry figures to  be a large part of that success.

RB Ahman Green (GB)? I'd be a  little worried right now if I were Dorsey=20
Levens.? Green averaged 6.4 yards  per carry Sunday as he rolled up 180 tot=
al=20
yards.? Most importantly, was  his number of fumbles: Zero.? No one's ever=
=20
doubted his incredible physical  skills, but now he seems to be bringing th=
e=20
mental game to go with  it.

RB Mike Anderson (Den)? I hate  to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a grea=
t=20
impression of Isaac Bruce's  maddening 1998 on again, off again season.? As=
=20
you know, Davis missed  another game and once again, Anderson stepped in=20
nicely.?? By now, you  know it's tough to predict what Davis is going to do=
=20
each week so it looks to me  as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup.

RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)?  Anderson's 4.5 yards per carry reminded many of h=
is=20
1998 season.? He's  running with power and speed and finally appears to be=
=20
over the knee  injury.? I think he's been over it physically for a while no=
w=20
but it seems  he's handling the mental aspect too.

?

WRs Moving Up

WR Willie Jackson (NO)? New QB  Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being=20
thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson  responded well with 4 catches and=
=20
85 yards including 2 TDs.? Often times,  you'll see a backup QB favor the=
=20
backup WRs as they're familiar with them.?  We'll see if this continues.? I=
'm=20
guessing Brooks will get comfortable  throwing to Joe Horn this week but=20
Jackson is still definitely worth a  shot.

WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG)? As I  mentioned above, QB Kerry Collins is playing=
=20
very well. With Ike Hilliard set to  miss some time, Jurevicius should get =
a=20
chance to show what he can do.?  He's long been a Fantasy Football tease=20
showing flashes but never really having  the opportunity for playing time.?=
=20
Let's see what he can  do.

WR Terry Glenn (NE)? I've  been?high on Glenn since June.? He made me look=
=20
good early on but had  cooled midseason.? He's now back warming up again an=
d=20
for you Glenn owners,  your patience is paying off.? QB Drew Bledsoe didn't=
=20
have a TD, but he did  roll up the yards.? Once again, Glenn was the prime =
=20
target.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac)? Smith  looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as=
=20
the Jags awakened their  offense?Sunday night.? Smith seems back in synch=
=20
with QB Mark Brunell  and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game.=
?=20
There may not be  enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enoug=
h=20
for  Smith.

WR James McNight (Dal)? Yes,  he's a long shot considering the horrid play =
of=20
Troy Aikman Sunday but you have  to like a WR who's getting a ton of looks.=
?=20
And McNight's getting those  looks from Aikman.? Can't make plays without t=
he=20
ball...

?

TEs Moving Up

TE Jay Reimersma (Buf)? We've  been waiting for Reimersma to return to form=
=20
and he looks to be on his  way.? He was heavily involved and seemed=20
comfortable with ""new"" QB Rob  Johnson.? He can be a vital part of the=20
offense and you have to think  Johnson will continue to utilize him.

TE Kris Mangum (Car)? Mangum's  no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a=
=20
nice target.? 4 catches for 47  yards is an improvement from what they've h=
ad=20
at TE and it looks like he's back  and healthy now.

?

Players Moving  Down

?

QBs Moving Down

QB Steve Beuerlein (Car)?  There's only so much a QB can do by himself.? He=
=20
lost Wesley Walls a couple  of weeks ago. I thought Beuerlein could handle=
=20
losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but  losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injur=
y=20
proved too much.? His OL is less  than stellar and he's just not having muc=
h=20
time to throw.? =20

QB Shaun King (TB)? King swings  back toward the side of mediocrity after a=
=20
91 yard passing effort against  Chicago.? It looked that bad too.? Even for=
 a=20
Les Steckel  Offense.? Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a=
=20
positive as  teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson.

QB Steve McNair (Ten)? Not all  the turnovers Sunday were McNair's fault bu=
t=20
he certainly had a hand in  them.? His problem remains a lack of healthy WR=
s=20
and a stellar RB in Eddie  George who can carry the load.? Last year, it wa=
s=20
McNair vulturing TDs from  George but it doesn't seem to be a problem this=
=20
year.?=20

QB Jake Plummer (Ari)? If  you're a regular reader, you know I'm not a=20
Plummer fan.? I'm especially  not a fan now that he's hurt as well.? He may=
=20
get back soon but it won't  matter for this team that's in shambles=20
offensively.

?

RBs Moving Down

RB Thomas Jones (Ari)? Jones'  was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but=20
still, you like to see a better yards  per carry average than negative 2...

RB Kevin Faulk (NE)? Either  Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is=
=20
not a very good football  player.? How else do you explain Faulk earning on=
e=20
carry while his RB  partner J.R. Redmond was inactive?? Patrick Pass got th=
e=20
bulk of the work  but was ineffective.? I'm guessing, it's the fumbling tha=
t=20
earned his spot  in the doghouse.?=20

RB Ron Dayne (NYG)? As we've  said so often in the past, Ron Dayne's=20
productivity is tied directly to how well  the Giants are playing.? If New=
=20
York is leading, you'll see Dayne.? If  they're trailing, it's the Tiki=20
Barber show.? Lately, it's been more Tiki  than Dayne.? And if the Giants=
=20
don't make some improvements on defense, I  don't see that changing.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)?  Prentice got folks excited early in the year but=
=20
he's been disappointing of  late.? Prentice is losing carries to Jamel Whit=
e=20
and that doesn't look to  change anytime soon.?=20

?

WRs Moving Down

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)?  Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it=
=20
appears the QB rotation is  affecting his play.? With Shane Matthews=20
starting, Robinson had 5  receptions for 53 yards.? While those numbers are=
=20
certainly not horrible,  they're not quite what we expect from Marcus.? He=
=20
could improve with  another week of practice but I'm a little concerned rig=
ht=20
now.

WR Joe Horn (NO)? As I  mentioned above, I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but=
=20
there is no way that he's  anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff=
=20
Blake.? Of special worry was  the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable=20
throwing the ball to Willie  Jackson.

WR Donald Hayes?(Car)?  Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his statu=
s=20
for next week is  uncertain.? He's a vital part of the offense and will be=
=20
missed if he can't  go.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ)? As the  Jets have struggled, so has Chrebet.? He=20
turned in another small game  Sunday with 22 yards on 2 catches.? These=20
numbers just won't get it done  for a #1 WR.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)? 2 weeks  ago, it was Amani Toomer taking the hard=20
shot.? Last week it was Hilliard  with the highlight hit.? He looks like he=
=20
may miss a game or two which is  bad news for Hilliard owners but good news=
=20
of Joe Jurevicius  owners.

?

TEs Moving Down

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl)? Kelly's  just too up and down to rely on to any=20
degree.? When he's featured in the  gameplan, he's?a nice player and can be=
=20
effective.? It's just that  it's so hard to guess what game that will be...

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)? Another  Jet receiver that's struggling.? Becht is=
=20
frustrating as he'll show some  nice flashes and then disappear for long=20
stretches.? I'm afraid to say he's  starting to look like...a Jet's TE.

222,"In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of 
people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that 
team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that 
perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic 
has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team 
and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy 
Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through 
CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the 
facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in 
conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior 
Director
 CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

 User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power 
Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

 NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
 ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, 
were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked 
in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles 
where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing 
both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the 
operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the 
past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project 
managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations 
experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most 
appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie 
on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very 
quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a 
scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over 
natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since 
Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was 
already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the 
project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to 
EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, 
who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom 
looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently 
renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange 
project team, and we transfered her along with the project to 
CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements 
work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is 
input from my group that has created the modules by defining user 
requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  
I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's 
participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a 
senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development 
background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was 
the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on 
CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her 
involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to 
CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is 
excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable 
operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie 
Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from 
day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging 
products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and 
both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and 
back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their 
replacements on CommodityLogic.

reported to Mary Solmonson within my organization.  The group was led by a

specialists.  The employees were made aware of this decision last Friday 
afternoon.  My HR rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive 
in finding new assignments within Enron through the Enron Corp. Re-deployment 
Team.  Mary Solmonson continues as one of my direct reports, focused on 
CommodityLogic and our business development efforts regarding the 
commercialization of mid and back office services.  

As part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of 
service within Energy Operations, I reviewed core versus non-core activities 
within my team.  I am committed to investing appropriately in people 
resources to support core activities.  And I believe that we can become even 
more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated.    The 
role played by the Strategic Intiatives team in coordinating systems projects 
will be more appropriately shouldered by the IT project leads and the 
respective business sponsors/end users.  The ""middle-man"" role played by the 
Strategic Initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value.

242,"Please change location of this meeting for this week only.  I would also

",Peggy McCurley,,ENW Staff Meeting
243," You asked that we share successes with you.  I believe the attached 
situation is an excellent example of out proactivity and mitigation of 
operational risk.

As indicated below, once we learned of financial difficulties, we pulled 
together a team which included Commercial to evaluate next steps.  The team 
went to Chicago and met with the owner of the reload facility business.  He 
had a financial representative present, and our concerns were validated.  The 
owner of the business currently leases the facility from the railroad, and he 
has not paid his lease in 7 or 8 months.  Additionally, he has not filed 
federal income taxes for:  payroll, corporate or personal business.  He 
estimates that he owes about $250M.  The facility is not fenced so our 
inventory of about $1MM is not secured.  He did sign a one page document, 
prepared by Enron legal, declaring that the lumber on site marked ""Enron"" was 
in fact ours and was not owned by his company.  This was a saftey measure in 
case the IRS came in and started seizing inventory.  All actions were 
initiated by Energy Operations personnel.

The team also visited another facility, and in contrast to the first 
facility, witnessed a more sophistocated operation.  The business is 
privately owned and audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers  Although they would 
not share financial statements, PWC's audit opinion was provided.  
Additionally, PWC prepares the taxes also.  The team made the decision to 
move the inventory to the new location ASAP.  This decision was approved by 
Houston Commercial, and efforts began to relocate the inventory.

I feel very strongly that had we, Energy Operations, not taken the lead, the 
Commercial team would have continued in the original facility, leaving $1MM 
of inventory at risk.  Although they had sold about 50% of it, the inventory 
would not have been delivered out of the faciity until about mid-March.  
Commercial did not have any plans for the other 50%.  While we certainly 
don't know if the outcome would have been negative if left in the original 
facility, we know that we certainly mitigated the potential risk.

Furthermore, last week I established cross-functional weekly meetings 
between:  Legal, Credit, Tax, Financial Reporting, Fundamental Analysis, IT 
and Operations to ensure open lines of communication.  In the meeting, I 
discussed this issue, and everyone agreed that we needed to develop policies 
and procedures for warehousing facilities.  EIM currently has inventory in 
about 15 to 20 facilities, some internationally.  Kent Castleman has taken 
the lead on this.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

on-going activities relating to MG Plc, I thought it would be helpful to=20
provide you with a brief overview of on our future new metals business, to=

further explain the reasons underlying the acquisition and to update you on=
=20
the integration team=01,s accomplishments to date.

What is MG Plc?
MG Plc is a leading, independent international metals trading business, whi=

provides a variety of services to the global metals industry. The business=
=20
dates back to 1881 when it was the German Metallgesellschaft Group and was=

active in trading metals from its head office in Frankfurt.  Today, MG is o=
ne=20
of the world=01,s top non-ferrous metals brokers and market makers, the wor=
ld=01,s=20
leading independent copper merchant and a leading merchant of many other=20
non-ferrous metals.

MG is comprised of two core areas of expertise, the Financial Services and=
=20
Merchanting Divisions.  The Financial Services Division was formed in 1970 =
to=20
provide market-making and trading services to the MG=01,s physical metals=
=20
trading business through futures trading as a member of the London Metal=20
Exchange and, at a later date, as a member of COMEX in New York.  In the la=
te=20
1980s, as a result of London=01,s growing leading role in the metals indust=
ry,=20
MG established a merchant trading office in London.  In 1986, MG developed=
=20
its warehousing division with the acquisition of Henry Bath.  In 1999, the=
=20
Merchanting and Financial Services Divisions, including warehousing, were=
=20
combined into a single company, which was floated on the London Stock=20
Exchange.  Currently, MG=01,s core trading offices are located in London an=
d New=20
York with warehouse operations in Liverpool, Humberside, Rotterdam, New=20
Orleans, New Haven, and Singapore. It has merchanting offices in Lima,=20
Santiago, Los Angeles, Chicago, Stockholm, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, New=
=20
Delhi, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo and Melbourne.

What does the Merchanting Division do?
The Merchanting Division is the world=01,s leading independent copper merch=
ant,=20
one of the top three independent merchants of copper concentrates and nicke=
l=20
and one of the leading European merchants of recycled non-ferrous metals. T=
he=20
division also trades in other non-ferrous metals on the London Metals=20
Exchange (LME), including lead, tin, zinc, aluminium and brass.

The Merchanting Division engages in the following main activities:

? Merchanting of Non-ferrous Metals =01) MG trades as a principal with prod=
ucers=20
and consumers, buying and selling non-ferrous metals and concentrates=20
(particularly copper, aluminium and nickel), exchanging qualities and=20
locations and lending and borrowing metals.
? Global Stockholding =01) MG holds stocks of non-ferrous metals at warehou=
ses=20
around the world.
? Merchanting of Recycled Metal =01) MG trades as a principal with supplier=
s and=20
consumers of non-ferrous metal for recycling.
? Terminal Market Operations =01) MG participates in the LME and COMEX usin=
g=20
hedging, arbitrage and position management to support its merchanting=20
activity.

What does the Financial Services Division do?
The Financial Services Division is one of the leading LME members and, base=
d=20
on the volume of LME metals stored, is one of the leading LME metals=20
warehousing businesses.

The Financial Services Division engages in the following main activities:

? Brokerage Activities =01) MG executes orders as a broker for clients in L=
ME=20
and COMEX contracts.
? Market-Making =01) MG is a market-maker for both futures and options cont=
racts=20
and COMEX and OTC contracts.
? Warehousing =01) MG stores metals and other goods in eleven locations in=
=20
Europe, the United States and Asia.

MG has also begun to prepare to trade non-ferrous metals using the internet=
=20
as its platform.  On 10th February, MG announced the formation of a joint=
=20
venture with Internet Capital Group, Inc. and Safeguard International Fund,=
=20
L.P. to develop an internet marketplace for trading non-ferrous metals. The=
=20
joint venture, called EMETRA, intends to establish a world-wide=20
business-to-business, e-commerce trading platform for the non-ferrous metal=
s=20
markets, including physical trading and the trading of futures and options=
=20
contracts.

Why is Enron acquiring MG?
Enron is committed to expanding its position as a global leader in wholesal=
e=20
markets. By expanding into new wholesale markets, such as non-ferrous metal=
s,=20
Enron expects to leverage its wholesale expertise and will be able to offer=
=20
customers new products and solutions to address their business needs which=
=20
link different commodities and inputs.

MG will provide Enron with a number of important benefits.  At the same tim=
e,=20
Enron expects that MG will significantly benefit from its association with=
=20
Enron.  Some of the benefits we envisage include:

? The opportunity to combine Enron=01,s core competencies in trading, finan=
ce=20
and origination with MG=01,s global position in trading non-ferrous metals.

? The ability for both Enron and MG to access new clients, particularly in=
=20
the United States and Europe.

? The ability to cross-market both existing products and new products such =
as=20
bundled products that offer combined metals and power outsourcing.

? The ability to leverage the opportunities available to MG by increasing i=
ts=20
financial strength and the resources available to it.

? The chance to overlay the EnronOnline business-model on the metals indust=
ry=20
to increase liquidity and contract market share.

What remains to be done?
Merging the business operations of two entities, even highly motivated=20
companies such as Enron and MG, has been and will continue to be a formidab=
le=20
and daunting exercise.  Having a shared vision facilitates rapid integratio=
n,=20
but there are many complicated and complex tasks that remain.  During the=
=20
conditional offer period, Enron and MG are taking steps to prepare for a=20
seamless and non-disruptive integration of our respective operations. =20
Ideally, when Enron=01,s offer to buy all MG shares becomes unconditional (=
15=20
July 2000 is the current target date), the two can hit the ground with thei=
r=20
feet running.

In the short term, a number of things must be accomplished to facilitate th=
at=20
smooth transition.  Most importantly, in order to ensure that the deal goes=
=20
forward, Enron and MG will work to remove the remaining conditions to Enron=
=01,s=20
offer, including obtaining the shareholder approvals from all shareholders =
as=20
well as obtaining relevant regulatory consents.

A number of other steps must be taken, however, during the first phase of o=
ur=20
integration timetable to ensure that everything stays on track.  Integratio=
n=20
activities will focus on four primary aspects of our operations: commercial=
=20
matters, financial matters, middle and back office issues; and, most=20
importantly, on the employees of both organisations.  Some of the most=20
important goals relating to each of these areas are:

Commercial
? Developing physical metal contracts suitable for listing on EnronOnline a=
nd=20
installing necessary communication and technology links to facilitate data=
=20
transfers and information flows between MG and Enron.
? Preparing a joint venture management plan for MG's interest in EMETRA tha=
t=20
is consistent with Enron=01,s goal of listing physical metal contracts on=
=20
EnronOnline.
? Identifying opportunities to
- combine Enron's core competencies in trading, finance, and origination wi=
th=20
MG's global position in trading non-ferrous metals;
- leverage MG=01,s position by increasing its financial strength and resour=
ces=20
available to it;
- cross-market both existing and new products to Enron and MG customers,=20
particularly in the US and Europe; and
- grow MG's metal trading franchise.

Financial
? Obtaining waivers from MG's banks in respect of change of control in loan=
=20
or other agreements.
? Preparing plans to integrate cash management functions and putting in pla=
ce=20
funding arrangements for August 2000 onwards.
? Preparing plans to arrange large-scale inventory securitisation to reduce=
=20
balance sheet debt before year-end.

Middle and Back Office
? Preparing financial information necessary to understand and maximise=20
integration benefits including, pro-forma consolidated financial statements=
;=20
profit and loss budgets for the third and fourth quarters of 2000; and=20
integration budgets.
? Determining the feasibility of integrating accounting systems (AS400, SAP=
).
? Assessing  MG's core trading and risk profiles and developing plans to=20
incorporate risk profiles in MG's metals books into Enron systems. =20
? Evaluating IT systems and infra-structure at all MG office + warehouse=20
locations and preparing budgets and programmes to provide MG staff with=20
access to Enron IT systems and applications.

People
? Preparing a programme to co-locate MG's London staff (145) at Enron House=
=20
over the weekend of 16/17 September.
? Developing plans to harmonize compensation, benefits, and employment=20
policies and practices; developing plans for staff reporting relationships.
? Communicating plans and status of activities at all levels of Enron's and=
=20
MG's organizations.
? Arranging introductions between Enron and MG staff and providing=20
opportunities for information exchanges.

Where do we go from here?
I believe that Enron=01,s acquisition of MG is an exciting opportunity for =
us=20
all.  While a number of steps remain to be taken, we have already=20
successfully begun the integration of Enron and MG.  By remaining=20
enthusiastic and committed to this process, I expect that this transition=

251,"As we discussed in Rick's staff meeting,  you can help your 7/1/00 go-live go 
more smoothly, whether you are implementing financials and HR or HR only.  
Here is one way.

Timekeeping, though it seems mundane on the surface, is a focal point of the 
SAP integration.  Entry and coding of time populates not just payroll, but 
projects and cost centers, real time.  We will now have more flexibility to 
charge employee and contractor time to the areas they actually work (where 
people work on more than one area at a time).  This will only happen to the 
extent that the business and cost center owners drive it.  This capability is 
customizable not just by business unit or company, but by cost center within 
a company.

To make this work HOW YOU WANT IT TO on 7/1, each ""organizational unit"" (as I 
said above, you can drive this in your cost center(s) only or across your BU) 
needs to be clear on questions such as:

1.  Whether or not they want contractors to enter time in SAP
2. Whether you want positive timekeeping (each pay period specifying the cost 
center or projects one worked on) or ""exceptions"" only (e.g., vacation, sick 
time, etc)
3.  Whether an approval process is desired and if so, what it is
4.  Whether people will record their own time using the self service 
capability eHROnline (typically more precise and less handoffs) or whether 
they will continue to use a timekeeper (typically a little more convenient 
for people who (a)  rarely have access to a computer or (b) work in many 
different areas and are not willing/able to identify and use cost center 
numbers or project codes 
5.  Whether people  know the projects and cost center codes they should 
charge to

Your leadership in clarifying this within your cost center and/or BU will be 
instrumental in driviing the level of change you desire, as well as 
minimizing the noise related to the 7/1 go -live.  We have been using a 
variety of methods to communicate and drive much of this change, but the 
business drive for how much to utilize the tool is determined by you.

The deadline for the first SAP time entry period is 3 pm Houston time on 
Friday, June 30.

Despite all our collective efforts, I expect that it will be a few pay 
periods before we get each individual clear on what level of acitivity is 
desired from him by his cost center or company.  Thanks for your help in 
getting through the transition period.  Please call me or Andrea Yowman if 
you have any questions.  
",Rick Andrea Yowman,,"BU the 
business drive SAP"
252,"As you know, we have substantially wrapped up our work related to this 
project.  Today, we are making what I hope are final changes to the maps and 
deliverables, with the anticipation that we will deliver to you complete 
binders by Wednesday.  

One issue that we wanted to communicate relates to the use of manual payment 
processes and the risk that processing manual payments presents in the 
automated Unify/SAP environment.  This issue was raised by Melissa during our 
discussion of the manual cash reconciliation effort caused by the inability 
of SAP to auto-match cash receipts and disbursements in situations where the 
money has moved or been received, but the corresponding JE has not been made 
in SAP.  Both Melissa and Cindy Morrow have been involved in subsequent 
discussions related to the below-mentioned risks. 

1.  Risk of JE and payment duplication:

Payments taken directly to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in 
Unify:
 In the event that the transaction giving rise to the manual payment is 
entered initially into Unify (which would be the case for all normal 
commodity payments, excluding broker fee and broker margin payment 
transactions), a risk exists that the payment could be recorded and paid 
twice (once by either A/P or Treasury when the manual payment is wired and 
subsequently recorded, and once during the normal Unify to SAP interface).  
Process controls will be put in place to mitigate this risk; however, all 
controls will be people-based, not system-based.  It is too late to rebuild 
the Unify to SAP interface to better address the use of manual payments.  One 
additional suggestion might be to work with each group to reduce the use of 
manual payments except under well-defined, important circumstances.

Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly 
to SAP (does not go through Unify):
If the payment is not entered into SAP with payment method ""J"", A/P will not 
realize that the payment has already been made and will process the 
disbursement a second time.

2.  Risk of understated expense:

Payments taken to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in Unify:
For manual payments that are not finalized in Unify (a process performed in 
the system to mark an invoice as final) by month-end (but the disbursement 
has already happened), expense will be understated.

Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly 
to SAP (does not go through Unify):
If payment is not input into SAP by month-end but cash has moved, expense 
will be understated.  (Cash outflow account will show a credit balance which 
will be flipped to A/P, but no income statement entry will be made at that 
time.)

3.  Risk of cash misappropriation:

In addition to the above risks related to the use of manual payments, we also 
believe that a risk exists related to the use of Excel-generated counterparty 
invoices and the lack of segregation between the person responsible for 
preparing these invoices and also for handling/having access to the related 
accounting records.  We believe that it may be possible for a settlements 
coordinator to change the bank routing instructions or bank account number on 
the Excel invoice mailed to the counterparty and then manipulate the 
accounting records during the cash application process to either write off 
the account balance or to reflect the receivable as being paid while 
constantly moving cash application balances from one counterparty to another 
(so that no one account balance ages past an acceptable range).  We have been 
unable to determine a set of control procedures that would mitigate this risk.

4.  Revision to counterparty banking details:

We are currently investigating the procedure performed by Treasury when 
problems with bank account details cause payments to kick-out of Treasury 
workstation.  If the risk of misappropriation exists related to this 
procedure, we will separately communicate.

The above may be unclear.  If so, we would be glad to sit down with you for 
15 minutes or so and clarify.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

I have attached 2 files below.  The file entitled ""Continental Power 
Assessment.doc"" is the assessment that I had during my eight week stay in 
London.  The file has 2 pages, the first being a summary and the second is 
more detailed.  I may not have given you a copy as you were on vacation 
during my last week.  I did have lunch with Fernley at which time I 
communicated these concerns and future projects.  Also, I met with James New, 
Paul Mead, and Gregor Baumerich on an individual basis and delivered the same 
document.  Lastly, I left a copy for Joe Gold as he was out of the office.

After reading your e-mail to Sally, I composed the second file entitled 
""Continental Power Summary.doc.""  This file is a summarized, one-page list of 
issues with which you, Joe, and I are concerned (as well as Sally and Fernley 
of course).  The arrows below each section points out the potential risk that 
we are really talking about.

I am on vacation Friday, June 22 and the week of June 26.  Sally mentioned 
that you are in Houston July 5 - 7.  Let's meet to further discuss these 
issues and so that I may inform you about what continued work is in progress 
for Continental Power.

We didn't really cover the role you intended to play with EES and EBS as far 
as Doorstep is concerned when we met with Causey/Buy.  (Or I just can't

Yesterday Debbie and I stepped the P&P group through the Doorstep findings. 
We set the scene, went through the report item by item, and put the findings 
into context, e.g. learning points from Coal.

Collectively, we are comfortable that required actions have been implemented. 

At present the group are on the cusp of transitioning from an origination 
group feeding deals into the Houston risk book, into a fully fledged trading 
unit with physical assets in Europe. Riveria - a potential acquisition of two 
paper mills in Southern France - and/or other acquisitions would be the 
catalyst for this transition.

The group are currently assessing their Commercial, Support and other 
infrastructure resource requirements in order to manage this growth in a 
controlled way. I have sent them the attachment - Roles & Responsibilities 
matrix for Global - which has recently been tailored for a presentation Mike 
Jordan will be making to MG, and will try to stick close and help them

might want an early look at May.

One number is particularly interesting: VaR for the Total Return Swaps.  You 
will notice that it decreased substantially from about $20 million in March 
to about $8 million in May.  We had several deals that expired (Churchill, 
Piti Guam, and Blackbird), reducing risk,  and only one new one (Motown).  
Most importantly, we cut back on our exposure to Rhythms from 5.4 million 
shares in April to 4.7 million in May, and the stock price continued to fall 
from $36 to $21 to $16 per share (the less the investment is worth, the less 
we can lose in it).

We will send you June numbers as we collect them.

274,"There are clearly a large number of people who need to know what is happening 
on the integration of the MG metals business and a large number of fluid 
teams working on different aspects of the project; however, most issues 
related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of 
the people involved.

We currently have two main forums for information sharing available to 
members of the integration team:

The weekly newsletter produced by Fiona Grant in PR, which from 30 June 
onwards will be sent to EEL management and the heads of those departments 
represented on the Integration Team.
A weekly meeting on Friday mornings from 8am to 9am in NW1006, which has been 
put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire 
integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and/or coming 
week.  

For now, I expect the weekly update and the weekly meetings to meet the 
information needs of the integration team.  If you feel this is not adequate, 
then let either myself or Fiona Grant know and we'll do a re-think on the 
subject.

To this end, and in the interests of ensuring that we conclude our discussion 
in the allotted time, the following are a few organisational points I would 
like everyone to bear in mind when attending the Friday morning meeting:

Attendees should distinguish between presenters and audience at the weekly 
meeting. 
Presenters should attend if at all possible and, in the event they are unable 
to attend, should nominate a replacement for the meeting (replacements should 
be notified to Esther Gerratt in advance of the  Friday morning meeting if 
possible).

For the time being, presenters and their designated areas are:

- Eric Gadd  Commercial and Acquisition progress
- Amita Gosalia  EOL
- Justin Boyd  Legal
- Toby Knight  Premises
- Barry Sangster  IT infrastructure
- Bob Campbell  IT applications
- Richard Sage  Middle and Back Offices and Project Management
- Lloyd Fleming  RAC
- Tim Davies  Credit
- Anne Edgley  Finance
- Anne Hicks  Cash Management
- Janine Juggins  Tax
- Andrea Kerch  US GAAP and Due diligence
- Nigel Sellens  HR
- Fiona Grant  PR
- Bruce Garner  Business Development 
 
As  this is intended to be an ""update""-only meeting, any unresolved 
substantive issues are to be taken off-line and the resolution reported the 
following week. 
Lastly, I would request that presenters focus on communicating, in an 
efficient manner, things which affect other functions within the integration 
process.  Doing so will assit other presenters in relaying the information 
presented at the meeting to other personnel in their respective areas.

I hope you find this useful.   We want to keep the information flowing as we 
continue the integration process, but at the same time we need to make sure 
we use our time wisely and efficiently.

International Global Products, a new Coordination team is being created in 
London to take on the Control functions currently performed within the 
Logistics team.

This will allow the Commercial Logistics team to concentrate on improving the 
bottom line results by negotiations and arrangements with outside parties. 
The Commercial Logistics team (Europe) headed by Graham Cane will now report 
to Chris Mahoney.

The Coordination function has been set up by Cindy Horn, who will be handing 
over the leadership to Becky Millerchip on following the implementation of 
SAP for Global Products. This team will handle all paperwork and 
reconciliations with regard to product movements of Global Products generated 
by the London and Helsinki offices, and the further processing of this 
information to the systems and users downstream. 

The Coordination function for Houston and Panama City will be headed by 
Michelle Bruce, with the Logistics team headed by John Harrison now reporting 
directly to John Nowlan.  Michelle will build her team during the third 
quarter.

be fundamental. This summary, produced as a result of the Doorstep review, 
could be a 'yardstick' to benchmark our businesses - ie an aid to 
communication between Commercial, Commercial Support and RAC re the level of 
Operating Risk within each business and the region as a whole. Consequently 
it would be complimentary to the BRM process.



I hope to complete an efficient/judgemental assessment internally for all 
businesses in conjunction with RAC and present the findings to yourselves ( 
and /or your desk managers ) within the next week/10 days. The aim would also 
be to establish that the currrent action plans for Systems Development and 
Support resource allocation is appropriate. The assessment would be based on 
a traffic light scale ie

Green inherent risk less processes/controls gives a residual operational risk 
which is accpetable 
Amber  - watch out - residual operational risk is high and/or control trend 
is decreasing 
Red - stop now we have problem ( Helsinki equivalent ! )

Upon completion of the assessment I will book some time in your diaries

281,"Discussions over the last several days with legal and tax have resulted in a 
change to the legal entity we'll use for the ""trading"" portion of 
Clickpaper.com activity.
   As long as our business model is a one to many model the decision is......
a. For Click Match activity Clickpaper.com can still be used as planned.  
Simply, we'll only be invoicing for transaction fees.
b. For Click Trade activity the following will happen.
 1.  Physical trading that occurs at any North American Hub developed by 
Clickpaper.com, Enron North America, Corp. (ENA) will be the        
confirming entity.  I  have asked legal to develop a simple recital statement 
for the physical confirmation to indicate that the transaction originated as 
a         ""Clickpaper.com on-line transaction"".   
 2.  Physical trading that occurs at any Hub developed for the U.K., Latin 
America, or Asia, has not yet been finalized for legal entity purposes.  My 
desire is       that we follow the legal entity structure used by EOL on-line 
trading for Hubs in similar countries.  We'll work that out soon.

Strictly from an operational point of view the benefits are many but the most 
significant is a much simplified mid/back-office effort in order to support 
Clickpaper on-line business.  We no longer need to be concerned about setting 
up more portfolio/book i.d.'s for risk books as on-line deals can go into the 
same risk books used today for pulp and paper.  Intercompany transactions 
between Clickpaper.com and ENA are now eliminated for on-line trades which 
simplifies the confirmation support as well as the downstream financial 
reporting/reconcilation activity that would be required by using 
Clickpaper.com as the entity.  

If our one to many model is successful, we move to a many to many model.  At 
that point, all of this changes.  So for now, ENJOY!

284,"Japan's Electricity Newspaper (""Denki Shimbun"", the equivalent of Megawatt 
Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century.  Several 
of these have focused on the power industry in the U.S.  A friend of mine ran 
across one on Enron that was published on April 13 and sent it to me.  I 
thought you would find it interesting.

The article focuses on EES in particular and about how we try to succeed by 
being first to meet our clients' changing needs.  It also describes how we 
use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.  
The article also briefly mentions the new office in Japan.

The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is 
about Enron.  Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the Japanese 
are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.

Denki Shimbun also has a web site at ""www.shimbun.denki.or.jp"".  They have 
small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is 
completely in Japanese).  Another interesting site is

Here is a rough draft of my notes from our visit yesterday.
Please read and see if it accurately reflects the essence of what you want to 
communicate.

My suggestion is that you take the time early one evening and maybe visit 
with Brent off site. Maybe over a
cocktail.  I'm sure you will be both serious and concerned

What you are doing is giving Brent his year end review and basically asking 
him to fill in the details with
actions over the next four to five months.

1) Brent has a great opportunity to take his leadership skills to the next 
level and by focusing and delivering
these challenges he will solidify his core strengths in the eyes of others 
and most importantly himself.

2)  You need for him to step up to the plate and fully support you by 
insuring that he will ""take care of the
business, completely and totally.""  No hits to the P & L,  zero tolerance for 
incompetency and complacency.

You can not do what you need to do Globally without the trust and confidence 
in his performance

Additionally he must identify and develop his successor.

Get a covenant from Brent that his is fully committed to do the work

Also let him know you fully support him and will continue to back him fully 
in this effort as long as he does his
part and keeps you informed.

Call me if needed.

At 8:30 AM Tuesday the 25th, we did our first trade, a 42# linerboard trade 
(the outside part of a cardboard box) with Con Agra (13,500 tons and about 
$6,000,000 notional).  We hope to do another trade today with Irving as well.

I am sure we will have a new list of bugs at the end of today but I think we 
are past the major issues.

Going forward (next two to three weeks), we will be working to get the 
product offering from its current 21 financial to about 50 financial as well 
as adding in physical at Rotterdam.  We will also be ready to handle any 
newsprint from Garden State at the end of August.  We also have some text 
changes and minor programming related to  wording on the site that is new or 
unclear to the industry.

We will continue to push for registration (currently at 12 who now have user 
ID, password and made it through credit, legal, tax).

The markets load in about 4 seconds now so we fixed the slowness issue.

We will also start generating a report each day on stats that are relevant.

I will try to get some read only IDs for people but give me a little time to 
get this done.  I want my tech people sitting with the traders this week 
showing them the system and making sure everything is working. They also need 
to go back through what they did the last month and make sure they clean up 
some steps.

We will work on a press release to maybe go out mid to late August to 
coincide with a larger customer mailing, a few adds in industry publications, 
physical product and a complete suite of financial products. 

I would like to thank everyone who helped us get to this launched 
successfully.  However, we all realize this is a beginning, not an ending, 
and that there is a significant amount of work still ahead.

318,"Thanks for a great lunch. I am, on reflection, very excited about the things 
we discussed.

The Australian/Pacifice role would be a fantastic opportunity. Kinda - Comm 
Supp Controller/CFO/CAO (whatever...) - basically Sally's & Rick's (C) eyes 
whilst they're asleep (Tokyo support would report into Sydney - same time 
zones). It would also have risk, control, processes & procedures 
responsibilities - working directly with Ted's group. I'll work with them and 
face the 'challenge' so to speak.

Basically - running accounting, risk & controls - and keeping the global risk 
function (headed by yourself) with a flag waving 24 hours a day - kinda 
CFO/CAO/Controller for Enron goes Global/24 hours.

The idea - 'Enronise' the junior offices - put an experienced person in there 
to 'set the standards' and the tone of operations - and train the local 
employess in the ECT way. Working closeIy with IT, RAC, Risk, Operations 
etc...

I love the idea. And I think the timing (vis Helsinki etc..) is perfect.

I think it dovetails well with the current environment of putting the right - 
experienced - people in the right places in the world to ensure that the 
standards remain high - especially with EBS starting to spread into the 
'world'.

Fernley was very supportive on the idea. I guess we would need to speak to 
Commercial people.

I also, on the London subject, spoke to Brent. I think London would benefit 
from Brent - he's a good guy. It would also allow me a shot at the new role 
in say a 2/3 month roll-out - starting in the Summer.

Let's keep talking. Let me know how (if?) you want to progress things. Hope 
Orlando was fun.

To document what we discussed by phone, I met with Sally Beck and Brent Price 
today.  Fernley Dyson has a vacancy that he is attempting to fill, but it may 
be 3 to 6 months before the position is up and running.  To accomplish the 
need in the meantime, Sally and Brent have agreed to share the duties as 
follows:

Brent - April 1 to June 15
Sally - June 16 to August 15

They are traveling to the UK the week of 3/20 and would like to schedule some 
time with you on either Monday afternoon or Wednesday.  Please let us know 
what is good for you.

Issues:

Housing - They will each be bringing their families with them (Brent - spouse 
and 2 small children - the baby will need a crib; Sally - husband and 3 
children - ages 15, 11 and 2).  I understand that the houses which have been 
vacated due to returning expats have all been filled, so can you have someone 
arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them?

Immigration - Due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and 
have made trips already, I feel it would be best to apply for work permits 
versus using the visa waiver.  I have sent them the forms and requested that 
Brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his 
sometime shortly after he arrives in the UK.  I have informed him that he 
should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by April 
1.

Tax - Please confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the 
short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit.

Benefits - I have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and 
benefits and, if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent 
in the US, they may claim the excess on the expense report.

Per diem - We need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size.

Let me know of any other issues we need to address.  As always, I appreciate 
your help.

328,"I think I'm unclear on some points.  

The accomplishments by 6/19 is for Directors and above - to Sally.  
Individual groups under Sally will probably set their deadlines PRIOR to the 
smaller PRC's.
I did not understand that Promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting 
with Sally nor did I understand that the employee had to be in their role for 
1 year.    I thought the Promotion discussion would be an agenda item of 
PRC.  Additionally, I understood the Mid-Year promotion listing would not be 
as extensive as year-end, maintaining the year-end as the primary promotion 
time.
 Can you clarify?  Thanks.

329,"I hope that your holiday was wonderful.  Nikki told me that you would be 
working from home today, but I decided not to bother you there.  I will try 
to have Patti connect me with you during my commute on Tuesday morning.  I 
start with a 7:30 meeting (Houston time), so I should be in my car from 6:30 
to about 7:15. 

I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.  I don't 
think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of 
June 27.  Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?  I have scheduled 
dinner for us on Wednesday evening, assuming that you will still make the 
trip.  Just let me know.  Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?  

Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG 
acquisition.  That should make life fun for you!  I wanted to talk about 
resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence 
efforts and longer term in the assimilation.  As in my voice mail, I believe 
that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a 
controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they 
run their business.  It seems that might help jump start the plans around how 
best to assimilate the business.  I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, 
as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already 
been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and 
in other locations.  Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who 
seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the 
names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is 
unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.  We can 
hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.    ",Patti Rick Shona Wilson Brent Naomi Connell   Tani Nath,,"Nikki MG

this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

regard to EES:

AR or AP exposure)  -    506
         Counterparties entered in GCP  506  -  100% complete

  All Priority # 2 CP's will be completed within 45 days ( March 23, 2001).

EES has approximately 14,000 counterparties to be entered into the GCP 
Database.  We have been dealing with EES' Karin Williams and  Scott Mills on 
the GCP set up.

We have quoted EES a rate of $20.00 per counterparty entered into the GCP 
Database.  We currently have 4 people working full time on the research, 
calling and entering of EES's CP's.  Beginning in January 2002, we anticipate 
utilizing a mutually agreed upon monthly fee.

Jason Moore and I are the designated Global contacts for EES in regard to GCP.



 GLOBAL  CONTRACTS  AND  GLOBAL  FACILITIES - 
 
In a February 16th meeting with Wanda Curry, Scott Mills, Mark Evans, and 
other EES personnel, EES indicated that they were leaning towards utilizing 
the Global Contracts Database.  We briefly discussed the Global Facilities 
Database, but we all have agreed to concentrate on the feasibility of the 
Contracts Database first and leave the Facilities implementation question for 
a later date.
  
As a result of the above mentioned meeting, we have an EES Demo set up for 
tomorrow morning from 9 A.M. - 12 P.M. in order to give EES personnel a 
""hands on"" demonstration of the functionality of Global Contracts.  A  
portion of EES's contracts include multiple commodities and staggering 
agreement terms that Global Contracts is now unable to capture.  Therefore, 
we will need to institute numerous system enhancements, with the co-operation 
of Global IT, in order to process EES' contracts.  The timing and IT manpower 
needs of these system enhancements will be discussed at our Demo by Global IT 
personnel.

If EES does agree to utilize Global Contracts and Facilities we will need to 
set up a separate EES maintenance group within Global.  

EES has informed us that they would like to do all of their Contracts Data 
input.  Therefore, we anticipate the use of 3 Global Contracts personnel for 
the training of EES'  personnel.  Two Global employees would be assigned to 
work directly with EES's personnel on a daily basis.  The remaining Global 
Contracts person would act as a ""Help Desk"" here on 37 to answer any Global

In regard to billing EES for the Global Contracts Database assistance, we are 
proposing the use of a ""flat rate""  monthly fee structure, similar to the one 
utilized  for Bridgeline Gas Pipeline.   We would also include a ""start up"" 
fee to cover the cost of the initial  IT system enhancements.

346,"Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
soon as I know a rescheduled date.  

In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  

With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to 
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please 
e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you 
have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name 
and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in 
Houston.  My extension is 35926.

Director of Career Development.   Celeste Roberts, who handled many facets of 
the Associate and Analyst Program will now focus primarily on Recruiting.  I 
am responsible for staffing, rotation management, and performance management 
reporting directly to Charlene Jackson.   Going forward, I will partner with 
the PRC Representatives and Human Resources to work through our mid-year and 
year-end performance management process.   

There are just a few remaining tasks necessary in order to bring our mid-year 
effort to a close.  As we are getting inquiries from Supervisors, Associates 
and Analysts regarding mid year ratings, we strongly encourage you to 
communicate final ratings to the Supervisors by no later than Friday, August 
11, 2000.    As was discussed in the PRC meetings in July, Managers have been 
given until September 15 to conduct performance reviews.    If you need our 
assistance in communicating information to the Supervisors, please let me 
know and we will provide ratings where requested on your behalf.

Additionally, as we introduced a new process during our mid year review 
efforts, it is crucial that we solicit your feedback.   To assist in this 
effort, we have identified an Associate and Analyst PRC Project Team.    
Please look for an evaluation form via email in the next several weeks that 
requests feedback on how well we delivered our mid year process and how we 
might improve.  We our counting on your partnership and candid feedback.

352,"You asked yesterday if any of us had any comments on the Analyst PRC 
process...  I thought I would share a few things with you.  The primary 
concern was that an individual was representing ""our"" people, and they 1) did 
not know them 2) did not know what they did 3) probably could not adequately 
answer questions about that person and his/her performance and job 
responsibilities.  Although I think the manager's in my group did an 
excellent job of providing feedback and accomplishments (the two analysts 
rankings in our group did not change from excellent), they were really uneasy 
about someone independent of our group representing them.  

Also, in general, it seems like the analysts are getting conflicting messages 
about the ""third"" rotation and the option of going back to school, staying 
with the company, etc.  I think a good idea would be to provide some clear, 
written message to the analysts and us about the program and how it is going 
to work going forward.  It surer seems like it changes every 6 months...  

Hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any questions.

Access Programmers - the contractors will be managed by the end-users they 
are supporting from now on.  The budget dollars for them are in CC 103849 - 
$50K per month.  Do you want each department to continue paying their 
invoices against these budget dollars in 103849 or through their own cost 
centers ?  Do we transfer budget dollars? Close the cost center?  

Equipment - We have 1 flat screen and several large monitors.  Should we just 
return all equipment to surplus or offer to others?

Space - Will CommodityLogic be moving and assuming the space that will be 
vacated on 3/12?

Fax machine will be disconnected/returned.  Digital Scanner will be surplused.

There are two printers that can be surplused unless someone else (CL?) 
wants/needs them.  TurkeyLegs and Tarzan.  

I currently charge 50% of my time to CL and 50% to my cost center - 103850.  
Should I continue this or charge all my time to CL and close my cost center 
?  Since Marvia is also be redeployed, there is no one else in my cost center.

362,"Here's just a quick summary of what we have going on...(not sure how quick 
this is going to be!)

EnronOnline
Offering products on other exchanges (HoustonStreet and True Quote).  We are 
going to offer specific products (various Gas and Power products) to 
customers who have execute rights to these products on these two platforms.  
Therefore, we will have three feeds to deal with and will need new 
applications built to support the interfaces.  We will be responsible for 
adding/deleting products, ensuring the sites match ours, reporting trades on 
these systems, bridging applicable data to downstream systems, etc.  Enron 
gets an equity ownership in the platforms depending on activity.
Opening up EnronOnline to brokers.  We are negotiating with three brokers 
right now.  They will have to pay a one year licensing fee to have access to 
the site, and we will allow them to transact for specific counterparties 
only.  We will also need applications built and establish specific processes 
to support this.
Wish List - we have a list of approx. 180 times that we need the developers 
to work on for us.  Jay Webb committed to Louise a few weeks back (when I was 
in her office) that we would get a resource (specifically Chris Luttrel and 
his team).  I think you are aware of this.  Chris is now moving on to do 
something else and none of our items have been addressed in three weeks.  We 
have had weekly meetings the last three weeks with the IT team (Mark Dilworth 
and company...).  Basically, since Mark has decided to leave the group, 
nothing is being addressed.  I am going to speak to Dave tomorrow about this 
and escalate from there necessary.  This needs a more detailed explanation - 
I am going to try to get some time with you next week.
Steel - I will discuss with Dave tomorrow.  He basically told me not to do 
anything (another topic of discussion....)
We are working on enhancing our existing intranet site for the PCG
Louise has asked that I not allocate any of the PCG time to Europe - I don't 
agree with this because I have four people preparing the management report on 
a daily basis and I have a call center that also supports Europe.  I tried to 
argue my point but did not get very far : )  I am going to talk to Dave about 
it some more.
Working on bridging to Thunderball and the new weather application
Legal/Credit - we do not always get timely responses from the groups - Credit 
is improving (they hired a new person), but Legal has one person responsible 
for new CP set up (Tana Jones).  When she is out, all application processing 
stops.  I am going to talk to Mark Taylor about appointing a back up at a 
minimum.  Tana does a great job, but our activity is really increasing (she 
also supports Clickpaper), so it is becoming an issue.
We have set another record today - we have already done 3,358 trades!!!!
No new news from Canada on power trading - Legal needs to sign off.  In Mark 
Taylor's shop
Argentina in the works - probably end of month. 

Clickpaper
We have so much, I am not sure where to start.  I had lunch today with Jeff 
Harbert to discuss what our needs were.  We need tools from reporting to 
credit...  
The commercial group is really wanting to start offering more products, and 
are starting to hire marketing people and traders.  The activity is really 
picking up
The contractors are working weekends (Call Center).  I am working the 
Commercial group to discontinue this.  We are not even getting that many 
calls during the week, and we have not received one call on Sat/Sun since 
launch (July)

Commodity Logic
Dale has been very involved in all the discussions and has been a great 
resource (I have received several compliments from the NetWorks team on his 
contribution)
They have not yet released the first module (Financial Mgmt - CFO).  Should 
be very soon

DealBench
No external customers - very slow developing....  Staying involved and in 
touch with the Commercial team

Other
I am still looking for an assistant.  I sent five resumes down to staffing 
and a week later the interviews were not scheduled.  I went down to complain 
and two of them were scheduled.   A week later, the other three were yet to 
be scheduled, so I am doing it myself.  I think we have some real issues in 
the staffing group - this is not the first time.
We are working on Disaster Recovery for the group.  
Super Saturday - I would like our team to participate.  Do you have an idea 
of who all is interviewing?  We would like to be involved.
We are looking at holiday coverage now to ensure we have coverage
I talked to Mary Sloan (SAP) and Keith Clark (Call Center) is working with 
her.  I think she really appreciates the help/input.

381,"Ted,

We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on 
specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and 
prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and 
the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has 
changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality 
risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary 
recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard). 

Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the 
Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I 
suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team - 
his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his 
considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult 
to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to 
address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this 
issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any ""prosecutable"" 
offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management 
style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and 
objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank) 
with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a 
different story to tell on Helsinki.

As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour', 
although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks 
back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy

382,"We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not 
being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in 
approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :



The primary control issues are:
? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had 
not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)

The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by 
Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will 
implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust 
approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.

New dad David D. tells us how the Visor Edge handheld helped his wife deliver one of the first babies of the New Year.
	
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0087/final/images/black_section_space.gif>	
""Baby New Year""
	
My wife Jenny and I were expecting our first child together on January 1st, 2002. For her birthday last July I gave her a Visor handheld and she has found several wonderful uses for it in her third grade classroom. For my birthday in August she in turn purchased a Visor for me.

At that time Jenny was 5 months pregnant and I was looking for programs that could help keep track of our busy lives as well as help us keep track of the pending event. I used the Memo Pad to keep tabs on things we already had and items we still needed to pack for the hospital.

I eventually found a program online called Labor Timer. It is so simple to use. All you do is push the on-screen Start or Stop button and it automatically calculates the start time of the contraction, the length of the contraction and the time between each contraction. We used it to practice so that I could work on my coaching techniques as we were planning a natural drug-free delivery.

On Christmas Day Jenny started having contractions. We used her Visor and the Labor Timer to monitor the contractions but that was not to be the day. Again on the 29th she had contractions and again no baby. However, throughout the day on New Years Eve her contractions were very consistent. That night after we rang in the New Year she felt very strongly that this might be the night. As I went to sleep Jenny used her Visor and the Labor Timer to keep track of her contractions. At 4 a.m. she said it was time to head for the hospital. Throughout the wee hours of the morning I used my Visor Edge to keep track of the contractions as we paced the halls of the hospital. The staff was impressed at how I was able to keep such accurate details as we roamed up and down the halls of Labor and Delivery. I fessed up and showed them the program running on my Visor. At 12:51 p.m. January 1st our daughter Zoe Grace was born. I am happy to report Mom, Zoe and Dad are all doing great.

423,"Gentlemen,

As you are aware, David Roensch, Larry Campbell and I just traveled to Penn 
State University and had a lengthy meeting with Dr. Adawaumi.  This meeting 
was mainly related to obtaining an update on exactly where they were in 
progressing with the PCB Behavioral and Hydrodynamic Model for TW's Pipeline 
System.  For your reference I have attached to this note what I consider to 
be the key points from that meeting.   I hope you will take a few moments and 
review the attachment.  I will be glad to discuss any questions you might 
have.  

Based on what we learned during the meeting with Dr. Adawaumi, I am 
recommending that we have a meeting in the near future to discuss what the 
appropriate next steps should be related to whether or not we enter into 
Phase II (which would include cleaning an actual segment of TW's system) of 
this process.  My Secretary will be contacting you in the next few days to 
establish a time when you would be available for such a meeting (4 hours is 
needed).  For this meeting, Dr. Adawaumi will be asked to come down from PSU 
to make about a one hour presentation related to his findings and 
recommendations at this point.

I believe you will find this very informative and essential in establishing 
what our next steps will be.  

Thanks, John Shafer

All,

I didn't catch the impact of this when I first saw it last week, but NYISO
is making a change that should cause real time prices to increase (relative
to historical prices) in cases where bid load is less than real time actual
load.  They will be committing GTs in the reliability pass of SCUC at an
incremental cost of zero (instead of committing a steam unit), which
increases the likelihood that GTs will run in real time under these
conditions, increasing real time prices.  The change goes into effect today
or tomorrow.  See below.

428,"George, after Bret's memo, go ahead and conduct the sampling.  the soonest I 
can discuss the issue with the OCD is in the middle of November.  I have 
reviewed the reports and results of the studies conducted by us and them and 
the evidence weighs in our favor.  At your leisure and prior to the November  
OCD meeting,  prepare a memo to file of the resaons and justification based 
upon the report results and data why Eunice is not the bad guy in this and 
why Texaco is.  Gradients,  plume elevations and characteristics of the 
contaminants show that this is not our problem.  Id like to have sufficient 
evidence, both mine and yours, to force OCD to go afterTexaco and  get us out 
of this issue.  

I think this would also help Bret's case for having Texaco (or whoever is 
responsible)  reimburse Northern  for the costs we have incurred for what is 
Texaco's problem.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""twea=
ks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

446,"I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal concerning new hits 
of PCBs at regulator sites on the Southwest Gas system.  It appears that SWG 
did some liquids sampling at two regulator locations near Victorville, Ca. 
and found small volumes of liquid accumulations (less than 2 oz.).  They 
tested the liquid for PCBs and found concentrations of 230 and 132 ppm.  The 
aroclors for the two samples were not known at the time of Ralph's 
notification to me but he stated that SWG plans to do further testing at 
their other 17 regulator locations.  This additional testing will be 
conducted in the near future and Ralph stated that he would share the results 
of his sampling with me.  It should be noted that the location of the two 
positive hits  were immediately downstream of where SoCal delivers gas to 
SWG. 

If we need to discuss this further, contact me at my home  (505) 624-0353 as 
I am taking vacation during the month of December. ",Ralph Komai Ralph,,SoCal SWG
447,"Larry,

Does the Victorville site have any geographic relationship to the delivery 
made to SoCal by Kern River (remember that Ralph told us that SoCal had heard 
that some condensate from Kern River had been turned back to them by 
Evergreen due to the fact that it was ""hot"" with PCB's)?  I would like to 
chat a little about your thoughts on this when you get a minute.  John

448,"I wanted to let everyone know that the meeting between Southwest Gas and 
SoCal concerning presence of PCBs on the Southwest Gas system will be this 
tuesday.  I had an opportunity to speak with Ralph Komai today during the PCB 
quarterly management conference call  that Transwestern has with SoCal to 
discuss PCB related invoices.  As a brief summary, Southwest has had isolated 
hits of PCB in liquids (232 and 132 ppm) and in wipe tests (10-100 ug/wipe)  
in regulators on their system and they have asked Ralph if he would assist 
them in the management and disposal of PCBs on their system.  He wil also be 
providing thoughts on how and why PCBs move in a gas pipeline.

I had asked Ralph not to mention about Transwestern's agreement with SoCal 
for which Transwestern pays SoCal for 86% of their PCB costs.  I had asked 
him to only focus on the Southwest system.  Apparently Southwest is not up to 
speed with the PCB regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that 
the mega rule will impact their operations and Ralph will probably provide 
input for that as well from an LDC standpoint. 

I asked Ralph whether Southwest seemed excited or worried about the PCB 
discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned 
about compliance with the PCB regulations.  Ralph said he will let me know 
the results of the meeting.",Ralph Komai Transwestern Ralph,,PCB SoCal Transwestern

 'm in Kansas right now...working for my Dad for a couple of weeks(and deer hunting), and am headed up to Manhattan tomorrow night......

I haven't done that in quite awhile!!  I am meeting Ruge and a few other KC Fiji boys, and Blair is coming from Denver.  I haven't been to Manhattan in 3 years or so, and haven't been to a KState f-ball game(in Manhattan) since the 97' season!  It's homecoming, so it should be a pretty fun weekend...of course now that I'm 10 years older than most of the kids there, I may have to be careful I don't get arrested for Child Molesting!!
haha

How's everything else treating you?  I am headed back to Vail around the 5th of Nov., to drive snowcats for the winter....
actually that's my night job....and the job that gets me my insurance and ski pass....I am getting a few photography deals going, so I will be doing that during the daylight hours(oh yeah...and skiing alot!!hehehe).

552,"First, as a ""heads-up"" the DPCA is somewhat in disarray after terminating the 
Executive Director and resignation of the Chairman and several members (most 
of it caused by retaining an attorney for the California DG proceeding 
without getting authorization from the members and then scrambling to figure 
out how to pay for it).  Therefore, before working with Peter Chamberlain 
make sure that the DPCA is funding him from dues and not an assessment that 
we might end up having to pay for (I think Peter may not be retained by DPCA 
since the DPCA is restructuring including looking at substantial increase in 
dues).  Just be very clear who is paying for Peter and understand our 
financial liability before you commence any effort with him (I could be wrong 
but I'd rather err on the side of conservancy).

Legislative Weekly 
July 26, 2001 
Issue 30, Volume 3 
A weekly publication from the 
California Manufacturers & Technology Association 
detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento

GOVERNOR SIGNS BUDGET 
The 2001-02 Budget passed by the Legislature was signed by the Governor this afternoon, July 26.  The amount of the total Budget is approximately $102 billion, of which, about $79 billion is the general fund, the balance is special funds. 
The bulk of General Fund spending is allocated approximately as follows: 
$33 billion K-12 Education
$22 billion Health and Human Services
$10 billion Higher Education
$5 billion Youth and Adult Correctional

The balance is spent on expenses attributable to programs relating to business, transportation and housing, state and consumer services, environmental protection, to the courts and to tax relief. 
In addition, Health and Human Services receive the largest portion of special funds. 
Tax relief, in the version passed by the Legislature, was very insignificant, the lion's share was $75 million for assistance to low income seniors and disabled persons.   A total of about $39 million was to go to sales/use tax exemptions for purchases of: 
liquefied petroleum used for residential or harvesting use (6.9 million)
diesel fuel used for agriculture or food processing (11.4 million)
farming equipment (18.4 million)
timber equipment (1.7 million)
racehorse breeding stock (1.3 million)

In order to pass the budget legislation, the Legislature also made a deal whereby a Constitutional amendment will be sent to the voters regarding permanent allocation of a portion of gasoline sales tax revenues to transportation purposes.  They also agreed to suspend a ?% of the general sales tax in any year (as of 2002) in which the General Fund reserve is determined to exceed 3% (existing law sets 4% as the trigger). 
See CMTA's Press Release on the Budget: http://www.cmta.net/press/072601budget.shtml  
  
SCE BAIL-OUT UPDATE 
The latest Assembly version of the proposed Southern California Edison (SCE) bail-out legislation was revealed this week in proposed amendments to ABX2 82 (Keeley D-Boulder Creek) and SBX2 78 (Sher D-Stanford). 
CMTA opposes this package as unfairly shifting the cost of SCE debt onto business.  In addition, direct access options may be severely limited as the Department of Water Resources (DWR) continues to enter into long term contracts for supply and the utilities may construct new generation.  The bills may be heard after August 20, or earlier on the call of the Speaker. CMTA urges you to contact legislators about the impact of high energy prices on your business and concern about taking on any more costs. 
Elements of the package: 
SCE Debt Payment:  Total $3.9 billion debt allocated as follows:
$2.5 billion to be collected, 20% from small and 80% from large customers.  (The demand level division between small and large is yet to be determined.)
$1 billion is left for SCE to recover from large generators.
$400 million tax refund from SCE parent.
No transmission system purchase or option.
Direct Access:  Allowed without payment of exit fees after January 1, 2002 so long as there is more demand for power than can be served by SCE native generation and DWR contracts. Green power deals allowed for small residential and commercial customers immediately.
Ratepayer Benefit Account:  Positive balances in the account that includes refunds ordered by FERC, litigation proceeds, and DWR Power fund revenues would go to customers in refunds in proportion to the March, 2001 CPUC rate increase.
Renewable Portfolio Standard:  Sets a target of 20% renewable power in 2010 through requirements to purchase renewable power for resale.
SCE Financials:  CPUC cannot lower SCE rate of return before 2006. SCE may be required by the CPUC to construct new generation under cost-based ratemaking.

CRIMINAL PENALTIES ON ENERGY PRODUCERS 
CMTA and other interested parties met with staff from the offices of Assemblymember Dennis Cardoza and Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante to discuss onerous provisions in ABX2 65 (Cardoza D-Merced) that would impose severe criminal penalties on energy producers. 
Amendments taken in the Assembly Appropriations Committee on July 19 delete references to petroleum products, coal and coal products, and limit the bill to apply to electricity and natural gas.  While no specific agreement was reached, the staff indicated that the author would consider amending the measure to more narrowly focus the penalty provisions of the bill. 
ABX2 65 passed (11-5) from the Assembly Appropriations Committee on July 11, and will be taken up on the Assembly Floor when the Legislature reconvenes from its Summer Recess. 
  
OVERPAYMENT REFUNDS TO PAY FOR TRANSMISSION LINE UPGRADES 
Assemblymember Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno) has amended her ABX2 78 to use any overpayment refunds ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for payment of principal and interest on bonds, to upgrade electricity transmission lines and to reimburse ratepayers. 
CMTA and the California Chamber of Commerce opposed the measure in the Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee on July 17, asserting that 100 percent of the refunds should proportionately be returned to the ratepayers who have shouldered the burden of elevated energy prices. 
As introduced, ABX2 78 required 50 percent of the overpayment to be returned to ratepayers, and 50 percent to be deposited into the General Fund.  ABX2 78 passed (15-1) to the Assembly Appropriations Committee. 
  
EXIT FEES ON NONCORE GAS CUSTOMERS 
CMTA and other business groups are working with Assemblymember Pescetti (R-Rancho Cordova) during the Legislature's Summer Recess to amend his ABX2 23 which imposes exit fees on noncore gas customers. 
The measure also expedites the review process for approval of gas facilities, and requires pipelines within the state to meet the test that every customer would expect to be curtailed not more than once every ten years, which increases the current standard of once every five years. 
  
INITIATIVE TO LOWER NATURAL GAS PRICES CLEARED FOR SIGNATURE GATHERING 
A ballot initiative to expand the entities that can buy and sell natural gas has been approved for signature gathering by the Secretary of State. The measure would allow cities, counties, municipal utilities and irrigation districts to buy and sell natural gas and be exempt from the oversight of the California Public Utilities Commission. 
Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza (D-Merced) is the sponsor of the initiative. Supporters expect that if passed, the measure would increase competition and lower gas and electricity prices for consumers. The sponsors need to collect the signatures of 670,816 registered voters by October 26, 2001 to qualify for the March 2002 ballot. 
This may be the first of several initiatives for the 2002 election seeking to address the state's energy crisis. According to a public opinion poll recently released by the Public Policy Institute of California, residents by a two-to-one margin (65%) say questions of how to address the electricity crisis should be decided, not by the legislature and governor, but by voters through state ballot initiatives in 2002. 
  
FED-OSHA HOLDS PUBLIC FORUM ON ERGONOMICS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY 
The Department of Labor held the third and final public forum on ergonomics at Stanford University in Palo Alto on July 24.  Following the repeal of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) ergonomic rule by Congress, Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao promised that public forums would be held in several locations to explore the issue of developing an ergonomic standard.  The forum follows a major victory for California employers when on July 19 the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board unanimously rejected a petition from organized labor to adopt the overturned federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) ergonomic rule. 
The forum began with opening remarks by Assistant Secretary of Labor, Chris Spear who explained the purpose of the meeting and Secretary Chao expressed interest in trying to obtain the best information and ideas available.  Federal OSHA requested that comments be focused on three questions: 1) What is an ergonomic injury? 2) How can the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, employers and employees determine whether an ergonomic injury was caused by work-related activities or non-work-related activities; and, if the ergonomics injury was caused by a combination of the two, what is the appropriate response? and 3) What are the most useful and cost-effective types of government involvement to address workplace ergonomics injuries (e.g., rulemaking, guidelines, best practices, publications/conferences, technical assistance, consultation, partnerships or combinations of such approaches)? 
Panels began with organized labor representatives who criticized the repeal of the ergonomic rule and urged the Secretary to quickly adopt new rules to protect workers.  The second panel was made up largely of educators and scientists who have studied the ergonomics issue extensively and believe that the science does not justify an ergonomic standard such as the federal OSHA rule.  The third and final panel was a mixture of employers, employer associations, medical professionals, organized labor, university representatives, professional safety organizations, and individuals, which provided vastly contrasting views on the merits of ergonomics rules in the workplace. 
Employers resisted the federal rule stating that it was based on dubious science that cannot accurately identify the cause of repetitive motion injuries attributable to work.  Further, employers stressed that California already has the only ergonomic regulation (Title 8, CCR 5110) and the only illness and injury prevention program (Title 8, CCR 3203) in the nation, already protecting California workers. Hopefully, Secretary Chao will take a closer look at employers' concerns and the lack of credible science before deciding what, if any, new federal rules or guidance is needed in the workplace. 
  
ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AT THE BREAK 
The week of August 20 promises to be a busy one, with several measures scheduled for late policy committee hearings.  Among them, SB 72, Senator Sheila Kuehl's (D-Santa Monica) stormwater monitoring bill, which was put over in Assembly Environmental Safety following a last-minute push for major amendments by bill sponsor Heal the Bay.  It is unclear at this time what form the bill will take for the August 21 hearing. AB 1390, a controversial environmental justice measure by Assemblymember Marco Firebaugh (D-East Los Angeles), will be heard in Senate Environmental Quality.  AB 1390 is pre-determinative of the state-level program reviews required by SB 115 (Solis, 1999) and SB 89 (Escutia, 2000). 
Cleanup language on the state's greenhouse gas registry program, established last year by SB 1771 (Sher), is now in limbo following Senator Sher's (D-Stanford) decision to use SB 532 for a renewable energy initiative.  The cleanup language may resurface toward the end of session, not unlike the SB 1771 registry program language. 
Among significant late entries in the environmental arena include: 
SB 471 (Sher), discussed in last week's Legislative Weekly, amended on July 5 with Proposition 65 language and passed out of Assembly Environmental Safety on July 10.  The bill contains language that invites multiple lawsuits for the same alleged violation, even in the face of a court-approved settlement.
AB 1329 (Lowenthal D-Long Beach) last amended on June 26 and again on July 9 to place further restrictions on handling and treatment of oily wastewater.  To quote the Senate Environmental Quality Committee analysis, the sponsors (hazardous waste treatment facility operators) ""have not provided any information that demonstrates they are solving an environmental protection problem.""  Moreover, their proposal has the effect of ""reserving the market for offsite oil/wastewater treatment to themselves.""
ABX2 60 (Daucher R-Brea & Hollingsworth R-Murrieta), last amended on July 14, creates a voluntary environmental dispatch program for backup generators.  The intent of the bill is to help stabilize the grid when a rotating outage is imminent by deploying the cleanest backup units first.  Interestingly, despite the lack of outages during the critical months of May and June, this bill is getting political traction, passing out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability on July 17 on a 17-0 vote.

Of course, there is still plenty of opportunity for last-minute mischief, perhaps more so this year than in past years if the energy crisis continues to dissipate and attention turns to other matters.

 ",Jeff,,the Chamber of Commerce
564,"Today's FERC meeting was a big deal.   Some of the key actions are:

DSTAR and RTO West are to be ""married,""  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can ""heal its wounds."" 
Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized.
The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs.   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation.
Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO.
Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.

Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided below:

Alan Comnes


The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).

RTOs 

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to ""marry up,"" meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an ""RTO week"" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some ""sticks"" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these ""sticks"" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how ""FERC can get there.""  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked


Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""NOPR"") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Monday it had opened a depot to store specific types of hot and cold rolled steel coils for ""just-in-time"" delivery to customers in the Chicago area, creating a spot market for steel in that city. 
The Houston-based energy and commodities trading giant said it will be able to supply customers from its depot within 48 hours, enabling it to reduce the amount of inventory they store themselves and cut the length of time they hold on to inventory.
""By creating commodities out of similar commercial-grade products, Enron provides valuable pricing benchmarks for base products, against which premiums can be set for any enhanced products and risk management services,"" Jeff McMahon, president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets said in a statement. 
In addition to its core natural gas and electricity operations, Enron is also active in markets such as pulp and paper, metals, and telecommunications bandwidth. 
Enron began offering financial steel swaps in November 2000 and today provides a range of physical products and risk management services to buyers and sellers of steel products through its steel desk and its EnronOnline trading platform.

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp (ENE) and EWZ, the municipal power company of Zurich, said Monday they have formed a trading joint venture located in Zurich, to go into effect Oct. 1. 
The JV, already approved by the city council of Zurich on Sept. 26, will be jointly managed by EWZ and Enron and will focus on energy trading, portfolio management and powerplant optimization in the wholesale markets in Switzerland and neighboring countries.
""The synergies will enable EWZ to offer more choice in products and services to its customers,"" EWZ managing director Conrad Amman said in a statement. 
""In this JV Enron is looking forward to work together with an established and forward-thinking market player like EWZ with its many years of experience in the operation of hydraulic power plants and its well-established customer relations,"" said Peter Heydecker from Enron, who will be co-CEO of the venture.

The dial-in number is 1-800-998-2462.  The pincode is 4718933",,1-800-998-2462,
567,"Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at the
power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale market 
in
the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) 
and I
created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and
Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made the following 
points:
   There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not 
in
   the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that 
would
   hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the 
West
   as well.
   High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does
   anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised
   by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still
   incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level
   equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.
   The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by
   scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load,
   therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time
   prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund
   as an asset allocation scheme.
   The market would function better if more information was provided to the
   market.
   The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.
To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, 
you
will find there are many ""hidden"" slides that were not part of the oral
presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional 
information.

According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot
more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the
generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff is
looking into the data we provided.

I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to
Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a
different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott 
and
answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of
eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be
able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of
scarcity .

VERSE:
   Wicked men are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the
righteous stands firm.
    -- Proverbs 12:7


THOUGHT:
   This is eventually true in every culture.  An evil leader is
murdered by his even more evil successor.  Ruin comes to the one
who brings ruination on others.  But ultimately, this result will
only be fully true when Jesus comes and judges all people justly
and with nothing hidden.  Then, God's righteous will shine like the
sun, and reign with him in glory which will not spoil, perish, or
fade.  Justice with mercy, love with strength, and life without
death will find their way in the city God has prepared for those
who love him.

PRAYER:
   Dear Father in heaven.  May your Kingdom come with power in our

In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

Big 12 Roundup

Nebraska ran its home winning streak to 20 games and ended Oklahoma's string
of 20 straight victories Saturday in Lincoln.
Nebraska continues to lead the Northern Division with a perfect record, but
Oklahoma fell into a three-way tie with Texas and Texas A&M in the Big 12
South at 4-1.
The most important game this week has Texas A&M playing at Texas Tech. The
Red Raiders have been hard for the Aggies to handle in Lubbock in recent
years.

Buckman Picks Horns

Brad Buckman, a 6-9, 235-pound power forward from Austin Westlake who was
recruited by most of the nation's top programs, picked Texas Tuesday, saying
he thinks the Horns are on the verge of joining the national elite in
basketball.
He chose Texas over North Carolina at the end, but also had considered
Kentucky, UCLA, Missouri and others.
He had said earlier that the lure of the ACC, where basketball reigns
supreme, was very strong and almost pulled him to North Carolina.
But he told me Tuesday, ""I've always wanted to go to Texas. This is where my
heart is.""
He also said his head turned Texas' way at the end because coach Rick Barnes
has established a consistent winning program and has been wooing and winning
big-time recruits
""After looking at it closely,"" he said, ""I think Texas basketball is really
on the upswing. They've signed two McDonald's All Americans (freshman point
guard T. J. Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and sophomore forward Brian
Boddicker of Duncanville) in the last two years.""
They could make it three in three years because Buckman's stock soared this
summer when he starred in several top AAU tournaments.
Brick Oettinger, publisher of Prep Stars Recruiter's Handbook, was asked who
was the biggest surprise of the summer.
Oettinger said, ""In terms of from out of nowhere - not in anybody's top 100
to everybody's top 25 - it would be Brad Buckman. Big forward, very
aggressive and a whole lot of skills - just about as many skills as . . .
anybody in the class. I've got him No. 21 now and he wasn't in my top 100.
Dave Telep, another national recruiting analyst, agreed Buckman is a national
top 25 recruit.
""The reality is that while there are 25 guys with larger names, there
probably aren't 25 better players in the class,"" Telep said. ""He is athletic,
can handle it some, he blocks shots, he shoots to medium-range and he scores
in the post.""
Clifton McNeely, the Westlake coach, also says his star's work ethic is off
the chart.
""He's a very gifted player with a lot of talent,"" McNeely said, ""but the best
thing about him is his strong heart and work ethic. I don't think you could
find anyone who works harder than he does."" McNeely also said he thinks
Buckman ""is the best player in Texas.""
There are some guards in the Dallas area who ranked higher nationally,
including Bracy Wright of The Colony, who chose Indiana, Daniel Horton of
Cedar Hill, who picked Michigan, and Bryan Hopkins of Dallas Lincoln, who
committed to SMU.
The Longhorns recruited all three of those star guards, but lost out on them
at the end.
Buckman averaged 20 points, 11 rebounds and 5 blocks for Westlake as a
junior. And he's the kind of blue-collar inside player Barnes loves.
McNeely said Buckman can play a power game inside and shoot from 3-point
range.
Asked to compare him to Luke Axtell and Chris Mihm, two other Westlake
players he coached who played at UT, he said, ""He has the physical presence
of Mihm and is a lot stronger coming out of high school, and he has the range
of Luke.""
He is the first recruit to commit to Texas for the early signing period next
month.
Barnes and his assistants are recruiting several other players, most of them
in other states, and hope to sign a  sharp shooting guard and a wing.
Buckman's  father, Brent, played on two national championship golf teams at
UT.

Basketball Team Has New Look

The Longhorn basketball team will have a new look this season with the
addition of heralded point guard T. J. Ford, who led Fort Bend Willowridge to
back-to-back Class 5A state titles.
When the season starts next month, Ford will be called upon to speed up the
Horns' offense and also create more opportunities for the team's inside
players with his lightning-quick passes.
Coach Rick Barnes is hoping Ford's creativity in the half-court offense will
improve the scoring punch of center James Thomas, who averaged 7 points and
6.5 rebounds a game last year.
Ford also should be able to provide better shooting opportunities for senior
forward Chris Owens, sophomore wings Brandon Mouton and Royal Ivey, and 6-9
forward Brian Boddicker.
Barnes had to operate without a true point guard last year. Fredie Williams,
Ivey and shooting guard Darren Kelly took turns at the point.
Barnes and the Horns coped with it admirably, going 25-9 overall and 12-4 in
the tough Big 12, but they shot only 41.2 percent from the field and had 88
more turnovers than assists. Ford should help raise the former and lower the
latter.
They also lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Temple, and
Barnes hopes Ford will be a key to helping the team get farther into the
playoffs this season.
Replacing departed wing Maurice Evans and Kelley, who combined for 30.8 of
UT's 70.5 per-game scoring average, creates scoring opportunities for other
shooters. Now Barnes just needs some of them to seize that opportunity.
He expects Mouton and Ivey to step up there. Sydmill Harris, a 6-6 freshman
from The Netherlands, has been a consistent shooter in pre-season workouts.
Owens was a star in the World University Games during the summer and is
expected to be one of the top players in the Big 12, and a more dependable
scoring threat.
""Ever since last year, the Temple game, it started coming together,"" Owens
said. ""It clicked. I didn't do what I wanted to do and I knew I had the
ability. Now I have the mental concentration.""

UT Women Looking Sharp

Coach Jody Conradt's Longhorn women's basketball team is picked to finish in
the middle of the Big 12 pack, but early practices and stiff competition at
several positons indicate it might be a lot better than that.
The Longhorns were looking good early last season before losing
center-forward Annissa Hastings and guardTai Dillard to knee injuries.
Hastings and Dillard are hale and hearty once again, but equally important is
the fact that the Horns' heralded recruiting class is living up to its  hype.
Stacy Stephens, a 6-1 sophomore, returns as the starting center, and 6-2
senior Tracy Cook and the 6-1 Hastings can back her up and also play power
forward.
Jody Bell, a 6-2 freshman from Canada, and 6-1 freshman Mercedes Williams
also are looking good at power forward.
Two freshmen - 6-3 Heather Schreiber, the high school player of the year in
Texas last year, and 6-2 Kala Bowers, last year's high school player of the
year in Oklahoma - are battling for the small forward job (it shows you are
on the right track when you can call 6-3 and 6-2 women small forwards).
Hastings is so versatile that she probably will see action at all three
inside positions.
Kenya Larkin returns as the point guard and other guards who will see a lot
of action include sophomore Kaira White, who has been looking great in
practice, plus Dillard and freshman CoCo Reed.
Alisha Sare and Asha Hill are other guards who could figure into the rotation.
RECRUITING NOTES: LaToya Davis, 6-2, of Houston South Houston, picked Texas
Tech over Texas last week. Nichelle Roberts, a 6-1 center-forward who teamED
with Mercedes Williams to lead Spring Westfield deep into the state playoffs
last year, is the only remaining uncommitted blue chipper and the Longhorns
have a great chance to sign her.

No. 10 Horns Win Soccer Title

The No. 10 Texas women's soccer team clinched its first Big 12 Conference
title Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Oklahoma.
The Longhorns are 11-3 overall and 9-0 in the Big 12 and have one regular
season match remaining against Texas A&M.
Coach Chris Petrucelli, in his third year at the helm, said, ""This is a huge
step for us. It's going to help us in recruiting. It's going to help us in
marketing. And it's going to help our confidence.""
Freshman forward Kelly Wilson scored Texas' third goal Sunday, giving her 11
for the season and tying her with Carol Finch for the season record. Finch
set the record in 1996.
Lerrin Biggers scored Texas' first goal and Kylee Wosnuk got the second one.

All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.

648,"Brett, since Enron owns NEPCO - true risk transfer under a fixed price 
contract is difficult.  However, I do like the behaviour that you get from 
such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget.  
My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like 
#1).  I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests 
appropriately.  You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.  I have already 
given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end 
of the scale and early.

of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to 
ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly.

Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers.

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement.
 
In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult.

Typically, TW's rates are entered with a start and end date and (if this is correct) the surcharge should have an end date of 10/31/2001 and there wouldn't be anything else to do.  If it's not entered that way, an end date could be entered now (whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level - the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts) and that should take care of it.

																									Concamin to Propose NewRegulated Natural Gas Price  Scheme
																									
																									? ? 
																									? ?  Leading Mexican business association, Concamin, will propose that  Pemex 
adopt a new scheme for determining the price of natural gas.  The details of 
the proposal were finalized at a Tuesday night  meeting of Concamin's Energy 
Committee. Pemex currently uses the  price of gas in southern Texas as a 
price of reference in setting  the price of natural gas in Mexico. Under the 
scheme to be proposed  by Concamin, the price of natural gas would be 
determined with  reference to the costs of extraction, exploration, supply 
and  distribution, plus a reasonable profit margin for Pemex.

electricity demand. The plan, pending regulatory approval, aims to  build at 
least one 500 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired unit and  at least two 600 
MW coal-fired units over the next decade, for a  total of 1,700 MW. More 
units may be built after 2010, eventually  raising new generation capacity in 
the state to around 3,000 MW.  Wisconsin Public Service also hopes to add to 
the state's power grid  by building the Arrowhead-Weston line, a 250-mile 345 
kilovolt  transmission line from Minnesota to central Wisconsin. The line  
would directly link Wisconsin to power supplies in Canada and North  Dakota, 
easing transmission bottlenecks to the west and south.  Wisconsin imports up 
to 20% of its power.

																														Demand Exceeds BPA Supply BPA 
																														
																														? ? Customer demand under new 10-year wholesale  power contracts with the BPA 
is so strong that the agency must  purchase power on the open market to 
augment its supply. To recover  the cost of these purchases, it proposes to 
tack a 15% charge onto  wholesale rates effective next October. Even with an 
additional  charge, BPA's wholesale rates are still well below wholesale 
market  prices currently forecast for the next five years on the West Coast.  
BPA signed new wholesale contracts last week with more than 130  Northwest 
utilities and industries for 10-years. Those agreements  pushed its total 
firm energy load? up to 11,000 MW. That is  almost 3000 MW more than the 
federal Columbia River Power System can  generate on a firm basis.

After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our ""Ode to Why"" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the ""Leading Company in the World.""

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.",Frank Gehry,,"Enron CRM Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition Gehry the ""Leading Company"

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R	An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to Enron's transactions.
R	A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the ""deal space"" and how the financial principals discussed 	relate to 	Enron deals.
R	The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron deal.

731,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

I have already spoken to the RIV and Canada Customs. My car was manufactured in Japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 6.1%, the GST and excise and import costs.

Purchase price = 35000 USD = 54000 CND
Duty on this amount = 3300
GST on this amount = 3800
Excise tax = 180
Permits = 400

Plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions (from RIV) = approx. 500

That brings us to $8200 CND plus the cost to actually transport it from Houston to Calgary (at least $2000). Total approximately $10000 CND.

Hardly seems like the best option.

Also, I called Williams moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year. And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to Houston was $4700 USD. Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be:

Movers = $7300 CND (4700 USD)
Flight = $1500 CND
Hotel = $1500 CND
October Rent = $1500 (I have a 1 year lease in Houston that expires at the end of October)

The total of the above is $11 800.

Frank - done some checking on the rockies / San Juan selling and it does not 
seem to be producer driven.  Last time we talked you mentioned 5/day selling 
right before the AGA last week- was not clear if that was Rockies or SJ.  Rus 
and I just wanted to clarify what has been done- Rus told me about the deals 
Friday- it looks like BP Amoco is selling SJ and buying Rockies?

My thoughts are that this might have something to do with BP Amoco taking 
over IGI Resources - IGI was Bankers biggest single client so that might be 
the tie in with their selling- I have a call into IGI and will try to get 
them today.

In the meantime, we need to have a call with Tudor to let them know what is 
going on (as you can see form the above, I am a little confused) and 
hopefully we can get some info from them to see what else is in store.

We are going to shoot for this afternoon.

814,"Introduction

In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide, we have 
upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we 
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your 
products.

This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days. 
Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade.

Summary of New Features

Multiple Children - A ""Child"" product can be the ""Parent"" of another Child 
(multiple links in a chain) and different types of links can be placed 
against a single Parent.

Static Product Bar Prices - When you change a price in the Product Bar and 
hit the ""+"" or ""-"" button, the price stays - it does not reset to the amount 
in Product Properties until you logout.

Sorting - You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on 
the title of the field. For multiple sorts, hold down your ""shift"" key.

Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis 
relationship identified. (e.g. The Product bar might before have said: ""Basis 
Link - Parent"" and now would say ""Stand Alone, Parent"").


Detailed Feature Descriptions


Multiple Children

The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together 
in a long chain. For example, Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product 
B, which is in turn linked to Parent Product C.

Warning: Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a 
chain, system performance is degraded by large chains. This is because when a 
customer attempts a transaction, the database must ""lock"" each and every 
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request. The 
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the 
locks. ""Vertical"" chains (multiple parents and children in one long link) are 
much slower to process than ""Flat"" chains (One parent with many children). 
Large vertical chains should be avoided. 

Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the 
same parent. For example, Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent 
Product B. At the same time, Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link 
to the same Parent Product B. Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated 
Basis link and a regular Basis Link.


Static Product Bar Prices

The new version of EnronOnline provides for ""sticky"" Product Bar price and 
volume changes. When you change a number on the Product Bar, it does not 
reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you 
have logged out. This makes it easier to update prices, volumes, spreads or 
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the ""+"" or ""-"" buttons. 

One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it 
reduces repeated price movements. With the old version of Stack Manager, if 
the price delta was too small, traders would often repeatedly hit the price 
movement buttons. Each of these price changes must be communicated across the 
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth. This makes it harder 
for customers to transact with us - each time they try, a new price update 
moves the price, resulting in an increased transaction failure rate. Entering 
an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price 
movement button means that fewer (but larger) price movements are necessary, 
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure 
rate.

You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices - a new field 
for Offset to Last Trade. This allows you to update the offset for Products 
which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu.


Sorting/Selecting

The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting 
functionality over the old. You can now choose any field heading (Type, 
Location, Reference Period,  etc.) and sort by that item. You can do multiple 
sorts by holding down the shift key. Example: If you select Type and then 
Location while holding the shift key, you will see your products sorted first 
by Product Type and then within each Product Type, by Location (in 
alphabetical order).

If you right click on the Product menu, you can choose from the same sort 
criteria, plus you can select ""Sort by Web Order"", which allows you to see 
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the 
website (note however, that a customer on the website might be also seeing a 
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing).

When you select products, you can drag your mouse while holding down the left 
mouse button as always, but now you can also hold down the <ctrl> key while 
making your selections. This allows you to highlight products which are not 
necessarily adjacent to one another.


Parent Products and F/X Products

One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its 
treatment of how parent products are displayed. The old version showed the 
type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar (to the left of 
the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs). The new version 
does not show the type of link. This is because the new version allows for 
more than one type of link on each parent product.

Some traders may notice that  their  products which have f/x links are now 
identified with a stylised ""fx"" in the Product list. This is to enable easy 
identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the 
parent, rather than managed individually.



Assistance

As always, if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality,

functionality, please call David Forster on 713 853 1861. If you had 
previously suggested new functionality which didn't make it into this 
release, rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard 
to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your 
requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager.

882,"Just so everyone is on the same page:

Based on Jennifer and Dale's discussions with Eric Bass, a new ""tokenized 
period"" will be set up in EOL.  The intent of this period (quick overview) is 
to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.  
This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month 
increments.

It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to 
the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with 
Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled 
internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara 
bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be 
heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These 
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.

An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and 
Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human 
intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this 
nature will have to be entered manually.

How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL 
product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.  
The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what 
is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal 
accordingly.  

For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:

  Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara 
ticket
  
  Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07
   04/10  04/14
   04/17  04/21
   04/24  04/28 
  
 Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing

 Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.

 Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open 
ended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date 
is on the path; otherwise
 the number of reconciling items will increase.

Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.

Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.

scheduled for Wednesday 2/16 to Tuesday 2/22 in room 3013. Lunch will be 
provided. I apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future. 
I was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first 
meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we 
know are needed in our work hours. 

Here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting:

Schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other 
contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss 
at the next meeting.

Each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for 
their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting

Bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow 
up with HR on schedules being used at Enron



The following is what I heard at the first meeting:

Our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that 
would more or less guarantee (other than maybe an occasional call) you have 
the weekend off.  Cross-training seemed to be the key here. Some desks seemed 
to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels. 
Cross-training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a ""just do it"" 
attitude. 

There doesn't have to be an across the board solution for Logistics. However 
all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will 
be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk 
changes.

Late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders 
willingness to do deals at any time. As we get a better handle on what other 
companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address 
this. Everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid-week etc. and 
really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job.

There were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some 
type of rotating group. Mixed feelings about whether the group would be open 
to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule. 


Feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification. I'm 
looking forward to our next meeting - Bob

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.

3-9497",Daren,465490 465322,
963,"Daren, per review of the Gas agreements between Tenaska IV and 
Williams/Apache and our understanding of the Agency agreement, I had a few 
items I  wanted to discuss with you (in lieu of our meeting today that was 
cancelled):

1. Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should 
have been charged at the contract prices with Williams & Apache (i.e.  2.285) 
and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary - 
230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.  If this volume was charged  at 
2.285 the total would have been $526,477.71, a difference of $184,138.99.

2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged 
$2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,300.  At the $2.91  
price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at 
2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.

I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for 
2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment 
if delivered at Waha.  This adjustment started in 1997 at $.03 per MMbtu and 
increase by 5% per year.  Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at 
.0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.

In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 22), I noticed that the gas price 
is 2.285 at Waha & 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.  Per review of the Apache 
invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at 
other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling & Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.  If 
Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a 
margin difference then that is upside to Enron.  However, I think the plant 
should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.

Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and 
October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from 
Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.  Therefore I don't think spot 
prices are part of the equation here.  Additionally, I recall from our 
meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of 
$.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas 
delivery points if my scenario above is correct).

So based upon items 1 & 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their 
November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price 
differences showed above.  Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of 
$484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/22, to Enron on behalf of 
Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.

  Month   Plant Gas Price Amount
  November  267,300  2.91 $777,843 
  November adjustment    $(167,062.50)   
  October adjustment    $(184,138.99)
  Nov. Agency Fee 1,350,000 .04 $54,000
  Sept. Agency Fee 98,813  .04 $3,592.52
       Total $484,234.03

reaching this conclusion.  Should you have any different ideas or thoughts

the base load sale) will not go to the buyback.  This is considered a force

miles/Bayer gas from  the plants at meters 988056 and 981550 to the Katy tail 
gate due to wet   gas. I called Lee Papayoti and Rick Tiotrowski from Bayer 
to inform of the move and to get Bayer to nom with Midcon. Called Jackie 
Young and   she was already and her way to the office for other reasons and 
she Kindly renomed and resent the nom the tailgate for me .  THANK YOU

confirm.  

10:00am    Sam from Gas Control called and informed me that the Bayer plants 
didn't want to take any gas from HPL  due to the water content. The tail 
gate   still had the intraday change in place and so does Midcon apparently

moved over to 5896 and will move to back to HPL on our 202 contract.  
Marilyn   said there will be a 1% fuel and a 4 cent change but  we could pay 
the fuel at another time or use it against the imbalance so she confirmed the 
full   5000.    New meter total is 49765.

Sometime after the close of business on  Wednesday, January 10th, Sitara 
Reporting will be migrated to a new version of Oracle reports. Oracle 6.0 
provides some needed benefits, such as, the ability to process reports on 
multiple servers which should help performance during peak times. Also, 
Oracle 6.0 provides the ability to create comma delimited files which can 
then be imported into Excel.

This migration, for the most part, will be transparent. If you use the Sitara 
launch pad, you will be directed to the new report server. For those of you 
who use Internet Explorer favorites to access Sitara Reporting, please update 
your favorite to point to the new Report server 
athttp://sitrpt.corp.enron.com.  All the same reports will be available. 
However, some of the reports will function a little differently. These 
changes were requested several months ago but were not moved to production 
until now.

If you know of anyone using Sitara Reporting but are not in the above list of

bachelor party on Saturday Feb. 3. We need to get a head count so we can
determine costs and accomodations if necessary.

Location: Houston

We will start out with some mudbugs and beer....

The plan is to charter a party bus to take care of us that
evening.....wherever we might end up.

If anyone is interested in hotel accomidations please indicate in your
email, we will incoprorate that into our plans. Any ideas, for something to
do between mudbugs and late night carousing....bring 'em on  (ie.....horse
races, go carts........etc.

Also, as an alternative to staying in Houston, Gary and i thought about
taking a bus  and spending Saturday and Saturady night in Lake Charles,
gambling and........

Again..Please As soon as possible send a reply if you are going and any
suggestions will help.

thanks

1032,"To forecast Entex:

We have a database that contains the citygate volumes by day, with the low 
and high temps for each day.  When we get a weather report for the new day, 
we enter the projected low temp and the spread into the file.  The database 
is sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provides 
an average volume for that criteria.  (For example:  With temps of 40-60, the 
sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 38 
to 42 degrees and a temperature spread of 20 to 22 degrees.  An average is 
then calculated from that volumetric data.  In this case, the average is 
calculated to 259,000 Mmbtu.)  Upon calculating the average, we then apply 
information we obtain through daily business and adjust that estimate.  
Things to consider:  if weather is cloudy or sunny, wet or dry;  wind chill;  
Entex's obligation on Midcon;  Entex's recent operating procedures;  Entex 
takes versus our prior estimates (have we been under or overestimating 
volumes each day), etc.

Additionally, since we only see about 30% of the meters, we apply a factor to 
estimate the remaining 70%.  If we have an unaccounted volume for a few days 
that is fairly consistent (and we have determined that the ua4 has not been 
caused by something else), we may adjust the factor to bring the estimates 
more in line.

Let me know if you have any questions.

1038,"As you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was 
scheduled for Wednesday 2/16 to Tuesday 2/22 in room 3013. Lunch will be 
provided. I apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future. 
I was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first 
meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we 
know are needed in our work hours. 

Here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting:

Schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other 
contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss 
at the next meeting.

Each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for 
their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting

Bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow 
up with HR on schedules being used at Enron



The following is what I heard at the first meeting:

Our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that 
would more or less guarantee (other than maybe an occasional call) you have 
the weekend off.  Cross-training seemed to be the key here. Some desks seemed 
to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels. 
Cross-training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a ""just do it"" 
attitude. 

There doesn't have to be an across the board solution for Logistics. However 
all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will 
be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk 
changes.

Late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders 
willingness to do deals at any time. As we get a better handle on what other 
companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address 
this. Everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid-week etc. and 
really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job.

There were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some 
type of rotating group. Mixed feelings about whether the group would be open 
to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule. 


Feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification. I'm 
looking forward to our next meeting - Bob

expectations of getting this King Ranch issue cleaned up for the prior months 
and correct on a go forward basis.  I spoke with Brenda on Friday to give her 
an update of our progress and one of the things that she stressed and wanted 
passed on to the team was the expectations that King Ranch would be clean 
(scheduled and allocated correctly)  for March and foward.  As of Thursday 
night's   P &L calc., unaccounted for March 2000 on Texas was a little over 
400,000 mmbtus.  As you all know, that number is way too high and should be a 
lot lower (on a bad month, no more than 100,000 mmbuts).  Hopefully, if King 
Ranch is the part of the problem for  March and we get these issues resolved, 
March will not be an issue.  I appreciate everyone's committment so far and

1051,"Some additional thoughts on the force majeure issue--i.e., are we cutting off 
shippers' supply due to force majeure?  

1.    If the gas at the point is out of spec on water, the answer is clearly 
no.  We're shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the 
tariff quality spec., not due to force majeure.  We have the discretion to 
grant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent 
operators and so long as we don't discriminate.   If that gas is out of spec 
on any of the specific items listed in the ""Quality"" section of the tariff 
(Sec. 44?  47?  I can't remember which but its one of those) then the answer 
is the same.  

2.  If the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons, I think the 
answer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons 
falling out as liquids.  I'm remembering the catch all section of the Quality 
paragraph as prohibiting ""dirt, gums, and other impurities that would 
interfere with the operation of compressors, blah blah"" or something to that 
effect.  That catch all seems to me to include liquids.  IF the c6 and 
heavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids, then the people 
delivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas--therefore no 
force majeure.   I read Eric's very scientific email and I think the punch 
line was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids--right?   The 
thing I can't remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. 
limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers 
are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn't 
work as good.  

3.  If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we 
could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  Generally, an 
event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic.

I'll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  DF",Eric,,Sec

The New Power Company: Going Green While Stock Price Drops
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

The New Power Company (TNPC, NYSE: NPW), which bills itself as the first
national residential and small business energy provider, announced that
it has signed a Letter of Intent with Community Energy, Inc. to provide
wind-generated energy to customers in the Philadelphia area. Under the
terms of the agreement, TNPC will market wind power supplied by Community
Energy from a site under development in the mountains of northeast 
Pennsylvania.
The new wind turbines are scheduled to come online by the end of 2001.

ANALYSIS: This is an interesting development, especially considering that
TNPC is still embroiled in a battle with Green Mountain for a significant
number of customers that TNPC recently secured in a bidding process from
PECO Energy. This could be an attempt on the part of TNPC to appease customers
who might have preferred to be served by Green Mountain. On the other hand,
it could be a shrewd marketing strategy from the energy service company,
founded earlier this year by Enron (along with partners AOL and IBM).

As you may recall, just two weeks ago TNPC announced that it had reached
an agreement with PECO Energy to supply ""competitive default service"" for
approximately 300,000 of PECO's residential electricity customers who have
not selected a competitive energy service provider. Green Mountain formally
challenged this agreement, arguing that the PECO/TNPC agreement is ""not
in the public interest"" and that Green Mountain should have been awarded
the right to serve as the default provider for the customers in question.
Thus, it seems curious that TNPC has just now announced the addition of
wind power to its portfolio of services. Up to this point, TNPC has been
working to aggressively acquire customers from other energy providers,
such as the approximately 285,000 natural gas and 20,000 electricity customers
it purchased from Columbia Energy Group. The acquisition of the customers
in PECO's territory was a major coup for TNPC, which is still in start-up
mode. Although TNPC claims that it was fairly awarded the customers from
PECO, the addition of wind power could be seen as an attempt to quell further
objections from Green Mountain or perhaps the beginning of a new identity
as a provider of renewable energy.

Community Energy, the company from whom TNPC is securing the wind power
that it will market, began making wind power available to businesses in
Pennsylvania last year. TNPC customers will be able to buy wind energy
in fixed kilowatt-hours, allowing for more customized service and tailored
use of power. Interestingly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just renewed
a contract with Green Mountain in which Green Mountain will supply about
37,500 MW of green power to aggregated state agencies. This indicates that
desire for green power is quite strong in Pennsylvania, and any energy
provider wanting to market in the state would be wise to include green
power in its portfolio. Thus, while renewable energy was not a fundamental
component of TNPC's original business plan, the company appears to be moving
in this direction (at least in states where it is strategic to do so).

However, this announcement comes on the heels of TNPC's announcement of
its third-quarter earnings and a sudden drop in its stock price. TNPC's
revenues for 3Q 2000 were $18.2 million, derived from the sale and delivery
of electricity and natural gas to retail customers in just two states 
(Pennsylvania
and New Jersey). Gross profit was $1.3 million, or 7.2 percent of revenues.
Yet, the loss on earnings before income tax (EBIT) was $68.3 million. The
net loss for the quarter was $69.9 million, or $2.96 per basic share. TNPC
reiterates that it is a new company with a very limited operating history.
Therefore, the company contends that its year-over-year comparisons are
not meaningful or indicative of future performance. The company's goal
for 4Q 2000 is to achieve revenues of approximately $60 to $63 million,
with an estimated year-end customer count of 340,000.

Eugene Lockhart, TNPC's CEO, said he was pleased with the 3Q performance.
Lockhart contends that TNPC ""achieved both our overall financial performance
targets and business objectives,"" and referenced the fact that the company
is still building its ""systems and architecture"" so that it can continue
to penetrate additional competitive markets. In addition, TNPC has raised
approximately $546 million in funding which the company is using primarily
to build its brand identity in this early stage of its operation.

However, despite its positive outlook, after TNPC made its earnings 
announcement
its shares took a nosedive, perhaps reflecting uncertainty about the energy
provider's ability to meet its objectives. The shares closed last Friday
at $9, which is a dramatic drop from the average price of $25 before the
3Q earnings announcement. TNPC issued its IPO on Oct. 5, 2000, at a price
of $21 per share, which at the time seemed quite high for a start-up energy
company with a limited track record. A day after its opening, the stock
closed at $27 per share. The stock was received so favorably for two reasons,
in my estimation. First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments.
In two separate, private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital
Equity Investments and DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214
million in start-up capital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron
is the majority owner of TNPC, with 57-percent control. Second, and perhaps
more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred its residential and
small commercial retail operations in California and Ohio to TNPC. Together
with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has come out of the gate
running with a significant beginning customer base of over 325,000 customers.

Yet clearly investors are now questioning the strength of TNPC stock, and
the company is at a crossroads. In order to keep its momentum on track,
TNPC needs to do two things. First, it needs to acquire additional customers
to expand its base. Key states such as Texas or Ohio offer the best 
opportunity
to secure customers since competition is unfolding at a more rapid pace
in those states. Second, as I discussed in my IssueAlert from Nov. 6, 2000,
energy stocks that are based on new technologies in general and alternative
fuels in particular are being received particularly well by investors.
Consequently, it is a very shrewd move for TNPC to suddenly announce that
it will be a provider of wind power. This could potentially send the stock
price on a upward climb again, despite the fact that financial success
of the company is still unproven.

Regarding the customer base expansion, Ohio looks like the next state that
TNPC will target. Just last week, the company filed an application with
the Ohio Public Utility Commission to provide electricity in the state.
Yet, it's clear that TNPC is still fine-tuning its marketing approach.
In Ohio, it is offering customers competitive energy prices, flexible payment
and pricing choices, and frequent flier miles as a marketing incentive,
but there is no mention in TNPC's application that it will provide renewable
energy in Ohio.

Moreover, several questions remain. Does TNPC plan to carve out a new role
for itself as a renewable energy provider, or it just providing wind power
in Pennsylvania to preserve its market edge in the state? Will the addition
of wind power positively benefit the stock price of TNPC? Will TNPC 
demonstrate
revenues of $63 million in 4Q 2000? And where will the company's next 
acquisition
of customers take place? All of these questions directly impact the future
success of TNPC.

Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with 
FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 
922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide 
additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will 
provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for 
firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate 
Program, the company said.

""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power 
generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said 
Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest 
Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor 
stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, 
restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80 
million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002.

condition and therefore must be stopped.  I think we need to tailor the 
presentation and filing to minimize the chance that FERC will take away 
flexibility we think we now have (i.e., the flexibility to embed shipper puts 
in transport contracts).   Even if the TW approach on unbundled options goes 
nowhere, several of the strategies we may want to implement next year depend 
on continued ability to sell embedded options.   Susan, Shelley,a nd MKM, I

Section II. A.  Do you think the 2.6 sentence is clear enough--meaning, they 
couldn't take this to mean they have a 10% daily tolerance on their 
nomination, just a 10% monthly nomination.

Section II.B.  4.1--As discussed, we need to add the words ""LDC or interstate 
pipeline"" after the word applicable in the third to the last line.

Storage section:
Need to add a 5% tolerance to their monthly storage nomination.
Then, we need to add a mechanism to handle their being off from that first of 
the month storage nomination.
The concept should be this:
If they are within 5% of their monthly storage nomination (in the paper pool 
or bank in Ed McMichael's proposal) but not at exactly 100% of the 
nomination, this volume variance will be rolled to another month and the 
proxy schedule amended.  The parties must  mutually agree to the month the 
hedges will roll to (protecting us if we have already rolled some hedges for 
our own benefit), with the financial impact of these hedge changes being 
borne by CES.
If they are outside the 5% monthly nomination, the volume outside the 5% will 
be handled as follows:
If storage takes are less than 95% of the Monthly storage nomination, the 
volume that falls in this category will be sold to ENA at the lower of (i) 
the average of the five lowest current month prices as published in Gas Daily 
for the applicable location; or (ii) the following month's Inside FERC or NGI 
monthly index, as applicable, minus $.01.  If storage takes are greater than 
105% of the Monthly storage nomination, that volume will be purchased by CES 
at the greater of (i) the average of the five highest current month prices as 
published in Gas Daily for the applicable location; or (ii) the following 
month's Inside FERC or NGI monthly index, as applicable, plus $.01, plus any 
applicable transportation and storage injection or withdrawal costs.  

I have not proposed this exact process to Melissa yet, but I have left her a 
message that I want to discuss this.   I'll let you know how that goes, but I 
think this is a reasonable concept.  The only question is....will she think 
so?

MEET ME IN THE STAIRWELL

      You say you will never forget where you were when you heard the
 news on September 11, 2001. Neither will I.

    I was on the 110th floor in a smoke filled room with a man who
 called   his wife to say ""Good-Bye."" I held his fingers steady as he
dialed.

    I gave him the peace to say, ""Honey, I am not going to make it,
but  it  is OK...I am ready to go.""

    I was with his wife when he called as she fed breakfast to their
    children. I held her up as she tried to understand his words and
as  she realized he wasn't coming home that night.

    I was in the stairwell of the 23rd floor when a woman cried out to
 Me  for help. ""I have been knocking on the door of your heart for 50
    years!"" I said. ""Of course I will show you the way home -- only
    believe in Me now.""

    I was at the base of the building with the Priest ministering to
the  injured and devastated souls. I took him home to tend to his Flock
 in  Heaven. He heard my voice and answered.

    I was on all four of those planes, in every seat, with every
prayer.   I was with the crew as they were overtaken. I was in the very
hearts  of the believers there, comforting and assuring them that their
 faith   has saved them.

    I was in Texas, Kansas, London. I was standing next to you when
you  heard the terrible news. Did you sense Me?

    I want you to know that I saw every face. I knew every name --
 though not all know Me. Some met Me for the first time on the 86th floor.

    Some sought Me with their last breath.
    Some couldn't hear Me calling to them through the smoke and
flames;

    ""Come to Me...this way...take my hand."" Some chose, for the final
    time, to ignore Me. But, I was there.

    I did not place you in the Tower that day. You may not know why,
but   I do. However, If you were there in that explosive moment in time,
    would you have reached for Me?

    September 11, 2001, was not the end of the journey for you. But
    someday your journey will end. And I will be there for you as
well.   Seek Me now while I may be found. Then, at any moment, you know
you  are ""ready to go.""

    I will be in the stairwell of your final moments.

    God

    OUR FATHER

    During the next 60 seconds, stop whatever you are doing, and take
 this
    opportunity. (Literally it is only 1 minute)

    All you have to do is the following:

    You simply say and ""Our Father"" for the person that sent you this
    message:

    Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom
 Come,
    Thy Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day
our
    daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who
    trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us
    from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory,
 forever
    and ever AMEN.

    Next, you send this message to everyone you know. In a while, more
    people will have prayed for you and you will have obtained a lot
of
    people praying for others.

    Next, stop and think and appreciate God's power in your life, for
    doing what you know is pleasing to Him. If you are not ashamed to
do
    this, follow the instructions.

    Jesus said, ""If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you
 before
    My Father.""

    If you are not ashamed, send this message ... only if you believe.

    ""Yes, I love my God. He is my fountain of Life and My Savior. He
    keeps me going day and night. Without Him, I am no one. But with
    Him, I can do everything. Christ is my strength.""

    This is a simple test. If you love God and you are not ashamed of
 all
    the great things that he has done for you, send this to everyone
you
    know, and the person that sent it to you.

    AMEN, and God Bless Us All.....

1109,"
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

First:
ST-CALI
We are short 100 mws for HE 7 in SP-15 at $220.  Please make the Enpower as a 
buy from counterparty under ST-Cali.  We will then need to zero out a 
imbalance purchase under ST-Cali and then zero out the short in ST-Cali in 
SP-15 in CAPS.
We are long 25 mws for HE 7-22 in NP-15 at $290.  We can move this out using 
Turlock, Modesto or Dynegy.  The account numbers are in the sheet.  The 
newest account is Turlock to SNPD #790617.  All deals need to be under 
ST-CALI.  Again we need to zero out the imbalance sale, so that we are flat.

WEST SERVICES
We are short 8 mws in SP-15 for HE 7-22 at $171.  The service desk has put in 
a purchase from the imbalance (Enpower #579037).  We need to zero this out, 
make a purchase from a counterparty under our book (ST-Whourly), then make a 
sale to the services book in SP-15.

ST_WBOM
We are long 20 mws at MEAD 230 from the services desk tomorrow HE 11-16.  We 
need to submit the transmission request to NEVP(services has already made the 
enpower), then we need to either input the power and use NCPA to run it 
across the path or sell it outright.  We are long at $150.  The Epmicalpoos 
and the sales need to be under ST-WBOM.

Any questions...please give me a call.  503-887-3449.

was planning on booking tickets for us on that day.

Let me know if you are interested and I will book you a ticket... or more

probably just book those instead of getting scalper tickets.

1227,"Mark & Vicki:  Attached is a brief e-mail from one of my partners in SF about 
a possible LeBoeuf engagement in CA that I did not think would create any 
issues, but which I just wanted to run by you in light of the entire CA 
situation.  I also wanted to make sure that US Windpower is not affiliated 
with Enron Wind.  Essentially, we would be representing a court appointed 
trustee sought by a number of project lenders that desire to cause the sale 
of an independent wind power facility since those lenders have not been 
paid.  I assume that the lenders have not been paid since PG&E has failed to 
make power purchase payments to the project owner.  My understanding is that 
we would only become involved if the lender group is successful in having a 
trustee appointed and that we would not be involved in any dispute or 
proceedings relating to the appointment of the trustee.  We would handle the 
transactional work resulting from the sale of the project to a third party 
buyer.  At this point, I would not see us handling any litigation against 
PG&E.  I would circle back with you first if we were asked to do this to make 
sure that, at such time,  it did not create any problems.  Could you let me 
know whether you have any concerns with this representation?  As usual, 
thanks for your consideration.  John

RE: Regulatory Affairs Washington Staff
      ? First Meeting Scheduled for Thursday, March 29th at
        Noon

Members have asked that EPSA begin coordinating regular meetings for the 
regulatory staff of our member companies here in Washington, D.C.  Like we do 
for the legislative affairs staff, EPSA would plan twice-a-month informal 
meetings to provide opportunities to share information and discuss strategy 
and tactics.  The group will not develop EPSA policy.

The first meeting of the group will be held at the new EPSA office on 
Thursday, March 29th at noon.  Lunch will be provided.  The office is located 
at 1401 New York Ave., N.W., 11th floor.  The agenda will include 
organizational issues, including future meeting format and schedules.

the totals


If I take the total volume, and multiply that by the total hours, I get a 
total of 318,557,665,950.40 mwh.    Is this what was physically flowing?  If 
so, then I think this number is wrong.  If this is our total volume, then I 
am worried because I thought we were just reporting our physical flows.

1246,"At the October 24, 2001, FERC Sunshine meeting, the following items were di=
scussed:

Kern River Firm Customers' Rehearing Request Denied (C-6, C-8 on agenda):

Called by Linda Breathitt, these are two Kern River expansion applications =
[CA. Action Project, CP01-69; 2002 Expansion, CP01-106] that have received =
certificates.  The draft orders deny rehearing requests by Firm Customers w=
ho charge that additions will cause further  pro rata allocations at Wheele=
r Ridge.  The draft order states that the benefits of the project outweigh =
""any potential adverse impact to existing customers?"" and that ""the solutio=
n to the problem of pro rata curtailments at Wheeler Ridge lies not with in=
terstate pipelines, but with resolving the problems of take-away capacity o=
n SoCalGas?.""  Hence, the orders reason that Kern River has satisfied its o=
bligations to its customers, and the current lack of intrastate capacity ""c=
annot be laid at [Kern River's] door.""

Breathitt is filing concurrences to these two orders to highlight the impor=
tant issue of FERC's response to intervener allegations of insufficient tak=
e-away capacity related to interstate expansions.  Though Breathitt doesn't=
 dissent from the rehearing denial, she wants to underscore the importance =
of the Commissions' acknowledgement of the role that possible degradation o=
f existing rights plays in the determination of the public need and necessi=
ty for pipeline expansions.  She also states that she is ""uneasy"" about FER=
C's ""strident policies"" in favor of adding pipeline facilities despite poss=
ible inefficiencies and constraints, and she reiterates that FERC's mandate=
 under the NGA goes beyond making sure pipeline gets into the ground.  She =
notes that the Commission will revisit the take-away capacity issue in anot=
her Kern River expansion application, CP01-422 [2003 Expansion Project].

Brownell Calls for Development of Regional State Relations Panels under Aus=
pice of ""Electricity Market Design and Structure"" NOPR, RM01-12 (E-5 on age=
nda)

Though  the issuance of a NOPR is not apparently imminent, under this discu=
ssion item Nora Brownell announced that she has sent a memo to the other th=
ree Commissioners recommending the development of some internal structure t=
o coordinate communications between FERC and state commissions.  The need f=
or such coordination emerged from obvious frustration expressed by state co=
mmissioners during RTO Week.  To get this process going, Commissioner Brown=
ell asked staff to pursue a structure, perhaps a type of regional panel, wi=
th the mission to strengthen federal/sate relationships.  Considering the m=
agnitude of RTO development, FERC likely will need to have dedicated staff =
work on this.  Chairman Wood requested that Dan Larcamp, Director of OMTR, =
bring a proposal to the Commission at the next meeting on how to implement =
a structure.  While all three other Commissioners supported Brownell's prop=
osal, Commissioner Massey noted that there's already been seven years of ""p=
rocess"" and input on RTO formation and that any new structure should be dev=
eloped ""in a way that gets us to an endgame"" concretely and clearly.

Western Infrastructure Reports Lay Baseline for FERC Adequacy Conference in=
 Seattle

Staff presented multiple detailed reports on data and background material g=
athered to lay the groundwork for discussions at next month's Western Infra=
structure Adequacy Conference in Seattle on November 2 [similar conferences=
 will be held regionally across the country].    The conference is a FERC ""=
fact-finding mission"" which will seek to answer three primary questions:
(1)=09=09Is the current energy infrastructure in the West adequate?
(2)=09What are the infrastructure needs for the region?
(3)=09What factors inhibit investment in the development of adequate energy=
 infrastructure?

While the presentations seem to focus primarily on electric transmission, t=
he conference will cover all energy delivery systems.  The overriding quest=
ion on all fronts is what needs to be done, and who needs to do it.  The po=
werpoint presentations made by Staff are already available on FERC's websit=
e at <http://www.ferc.gov/calendar/commissionmeetings/discussion_papers.htm=
>

""RTO Week"" Update=20

Staff updated the Commissioners and public on the week of RTO panels held a=
t FERC last week.  Staff is preparing and organizing a document outlining ""=
what Staff heard,"" which will be posted on FERC's website this week.  The d=
ocument is intended to give focus to reply comments from stakeholders.  Sta=
ff also suggested that there may be a need to hold smaller, more focused St=
aff sessions to ""dig deeper?.""  According to Staff, while there seemed to b=
e some consensus at the 10.000 mile high level, more specific issues emerge=
d which may require further discussion.

Lengthy Updates and Discussion on Two RTO Mediations (Southeast, Northeast)=
, Midwest RTO Progress

In the Northeast and Southeast RTO mediation cases, Staff and the mediating=
 Judges briefed the Commissioners on where the ordered mediations left off,=
 what proposals and options are now on the table, and what next steps may b=
e necessary.  These mediation reports will be available online (by end of w=
eek).  What is not clear is when the Commission is going to vote on RTOs - =
there were no votes at the meeting, only discussion.

In the Midwest, both MISO and ARTO are ready for operations, and MISO and S=
PP are also prepared to merge.  While Commissioners discussed specifics of =
all the Midwest proposals, again no vote was taken or any indication given =
as to when a vote may occur.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

1251,"Rod, per our discussion recently, I've drafted up some language to be 
included in ETS approval authority guidelines in the event that projects 
overrun their initially approved amounts:

Once capital projects are approved (whether included in the Plan or not), 
spending is limited to the approved level. If a project is projected to 
overrun, proper approval authority must be obtained prior to expending or 
committing to anything over the approved amount. In no case, can anything be 
spent over the approved amount without obtaining additional approval.

To determine the appropriate approval level needed, add the expected overrun 
to the originally approved amount. Then go to the appropriate section (ie 
projects not approved in the Plan or projects approved in the Plan) and 
identify the appropriate approval level for the new total. For example, if a 
capital project was approved in the Plan for $1.8MM and it is projected to 
overrun by $.2MM, the ETS President can approve the overrun. However, if the 
original amount were $1.9MM in the Plan and is expected to overrun by $.2MM, 
the ETS President cannot approve. It must go to the GPG CEO. Further, if the 
project's new total exceeds the GPG CEO authority, the decision will be made 
at that level when and how to obtain approval from Enron's Office of the 
Chairman.

Nice to see your name - I haven't seen you in a while as I'm no longer attending Causey's meetings since I'm in RAC.  

It's fine for Enron subsidiaries to have their own risk management policies that fit within Enron's risk management policy, and because we do want them to meet Enron's requirements, I'm glad you're working with Frank so we can help you work through it.  In addition, I'm in the process of re-writing Enron's risk management policy, and if there are certain transportation and distribution risk management issues that we should be addressing, I'd like to discuss those with you so we can incorporate those into this version of Enron's policy.

In 1999 we (ENA through Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp.) entered into a 12-year prepay.  We got approximately $297MM in cash up front, with delivery obligations at various delivery points, including NNG-Demarc, Rockies, TW-SJ, NIT, Topock and Sumas over the life of the deal.  

Currently the end users are Clark Public Utility District (Washington State), City of Glendale (California), City of Pasadena Water and Power Department (California), and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California).

It is my understanding that ENGMC is not currently in bankruptcy.

I am sending down to Mike's attention a CD with the project documents on it.  I apologize in advance for the absence of a table of contents, but I felt lucky just to get the information.  Teresa Bushman may have a hard copy of the documents.

Roger Mock said that on Saturday he received a call from Kevin Brady notifying APEA that deliveries on Northern were being cut.  The documentation allows for some delivery point flexibility, should alternative delivery points be better for us at this time.  The other parties to the APEA deal are anxious to work out alternatives, if possible. 

Roger can be reached at (800) 476-3749.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

1291,"Andy Lang thinks Nisource management may be receptive to considering some 
joint participation with respect to the Reliant disposition.  Nisource has 
been in the data room for an early look at Reliant's two LDC's, but 
discussions broke down (possibly they had enough to worry about with 
Columbia?).  

Anyway, I have been thinking about an Enron/Nisource JV structure for the 
Reliant deal that would seemingly accomplish a number of objectives for both 
companies.  The valuations are preliminary and the structure could be 
adjusted a number of ways, but at least it is food for thought.

I discussed this briefly with Brian Redmond and Tim Detmering this 
afternoon.  They expressed interest in the unregulated storage (TPC/MHP) at 
Egan and Moss Bluff, which by the way, is NOT officially for sale, but are 
somewhat cool on the regulated storage that IS INCLUDED in the disposition.

Tim said that as a result of the Nisource/Columbia merger, he had intended to 
ask Mark Metts to cycle with you and Cliff Baxter to discuss how best to 
approach Nisource looking for ways to improve the ENA service contract with 
Columbia.  If such a meeting were to take place, perhaps there would be a 
natural opportunity to explore a JV concept.

an argument to Louis Dreyfus regarding the validity of their contract, we 
need to hear the tapes of Todoroff's conversations with Louis Dreyfus.  The 
""paper"" that we have (including the notes from the Louis Dreyfus contract 
administrator) certainly indicates that Louis Dreyfus suspected or knew that 
something was not quite right about the December 1999 transaction with 
Todoroff, but it is not enough to make a very good case for challenging the 
validity/enforceability of that contract.  We need more.  John DeGeeter of 
Vinson & Elkins has spoken with Louis Dreyfus'  general counsel.  Louis 
Dreyfus' general counsel has told John that before he will consider providing 
EOTT with the tapes, he wants EOTT to set forth in writing the reason EOTT is 
requesting the tapes.  Louis Dreyfus' general counsel has also indicated that 
he is not sure that Louis Dreyfus taped these conversations.

Although a final decision has not been made, here's where I think we are 
headed with Louis Dreyfus.  We will send their general counsel a letter next 
week indicating the irregularities with this contract (e.g. the prices quoted 
in the contract were far below market, and the contract administrator had 
questions about Todoroff's authorization and the ""legality"" of the deal).  
This proposed letter would then suggest that Louis Dreyfus provide us with 
their tape recordings of the conversations with Todoroff in order that we can 
immediately resolve our questions as to whether one of Louis Dreyfus' 
employees knowingly assisted Todoroff in his scheme to defraud EOTT.  My 
guess is that a letter of that nature will at least cause Louis Dreyfus'  
lawyers to listen to the tapes.  If the tapes do contain incriminating 
conversations, we might see a softening of their negotiating position.  If 
the tapes do not contain anything incriminating, it would seem to be in Louis 
Dreyfus' best interest to provide us with the tapes to support their position 
that there was nothing irregular about the transaction.

dark fiber at risk?  In other words are we taking a long position in dark 
fiber.  What is our capacity situation today?

1346,"State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails 
Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said. ",,,Questar Corp. Questar MMcf

December 4, 2000.  Although the facts are still being developed, this 
customer was also being supplied off of the A-S line and when it went down, 
HPL had to activate another pipeline to serve this customer from a different 
source or direction.  This line may have had some liquids settled in the line 
or other sediments which became dislodged and ultimately may have caused a 
failure at Ameripol's boiler.  This resulted in a fire which they claim 
caused equipment and product damages.  Liquids are not identified in the 
quality specifications for the gas to be delivered to Ameripol, only not more 
than 20 grains of sulfur or 7 pounds of water vapor.
Additionally, the contract does contain a waiver of consequential damages.  
Gary indicated to me that they told him that about $130,000 of the loss was a

Further to documents previously submitted, please note:

TAX:  Regarding tax provision with HQUS set forth in the ISDA, our tax 
department does require the representation in our US to US masters.  Please 
have your tax attorney discuss this with our tax attorney, Morris Clark at 
713 853-5846.  Further, upon review of our tax comments as to the guaranty, I 
have been advised by our tax department that the FORM W 8BEN will not be 
necessary, therefore, the one sentence paragraph in my comments immediately 
following Specified Jurisdiction should be deleted.

OPINIONS:  As I referenced in our conversation today, in respect of the HQ 
opinion, the definitional structure is intended to cover the Guaranty and the 
ISDA to the extent ISDA representations concern HQ as Guarantor and joining 
the ISDA for effecting such specific representations.  In connection with the 
Guaranty, it is intended that the opinion cover the Guaranty as it relates to 
supporting the particular types of underlying obligations to be entered into 
by HQUS and ENA, which we understand to be both hedge derivatives and 
speculative derivatives for up to multiple years.

 BOARD MINUTES:  My reading of the resolutions submitted suggests that HQ 
guaranties for financial derivative transactions are not affirmatively 
authorized thereby.  Are there other resolutions?

1459," BASIC RULES
 for
 CATS RUNNING A HOUSE 
 
 
 CHAIRS AND RUGS:
 If you have to throw up, get into a chair quickly.
 If you cannot manage in
 time, get to an Oriental rug. If no Oriental rug,
 shag is good.
 
 
 DOORS:  
 Do not allow closed doors in any room. Once the door
 is opened, it is not
 necessary to use it.
 
 
 GUESTS:
 Sit on guest that hates cats the most. 
 
 For sitting on laps or rubbing against trousers,
 select fabric color which
 contrasts well with your fur. For example:
 white-furred cats go to black
 wool clothing.
 
 
 Run from guest who claims, ""I love kitties"", be
 ready with aloof disdain.
 
 
 When walking among dishes on the dinner table, be
 prepared to look surprised
 and hurt when scolded.
 
 Always accompany guests to the bathroom. It is not
 necessary to do anything.
 Just sit and stare.
 
 
 WORK:
 If one of your humans is sewing or writing and
 another is idle, stay with
 the busy one. This is called helping,  these are the
 rules:
 
 
 1.When helping cooking, sit just behind the left
 heel of the cook. You
 cannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of
 being stepped on.
 
 2.For book readers, get in close under the chin,
 between the human's eyes
 and the book, unless you can lie across the book
 itself.
 
 
 PLAY:
 It is important. Get enough sleep in the daytime so
 you are fresh for
 playing catch mouse or king-o-the-hill on their bed
 between 2 and 4 a.m.

RE:  Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day


Please be reminded that Thursday, May 31, 2001, is the First Notice Day, for
the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of June 2001
(the new spot month).

On Wednesday, May 30, 2001, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers and
Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"")
system trained representative available until such time as the Exchange
deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

My understanding of the difference between ExIm Bank and OPIC: ExIm 
guarantees bank nad commercial transactions.
OPIC provides insurance for physical assets located in foreign countries, 
owned by  US investors. OPIC offers protection
against political risk. ExIm guarantee, I think, covers commercial risk. Brad 
Blesie would know 
what exactly the difference is.

1573,"Dear all,

Thanks for your responses regarding availability and thoughts for the 2001
financial maths course. Attached is a word version of the previous outline.
I have also included some comments from previous delegates on what they
would like to see this year. Most points address the level we should aim for
and the balance of theory and practical applications. I hope these points
help you to improve on what is already our premier EPRM training course.

I would like to confirm the final points and any new biographical details by
Thursday, March 22nd in order to allow us a strong lead time to market the
event. If you have any questions, please call me on 212 925 6990 extension
225 or send me an email.

As a checklist these are the points I would like to clarify:

1. Confirmed availability for venues outlined in the draft programme.
 London, 28 & 29 June
 New York, 9 & 10 July
 Houston, 16 & 17 July

Unless specified on the draft, each speaker is down for each of the three
venues. Please let me know if this is not possible.

2. Updated talk titles and bullet points. These should be updated to reflect
the developments in the energy markets since September 2000.
3. Full name and job titles as you wish them to appear on the brochure.
4. Updated biographies. I will assume that the biographies from previous
courses are correct unless told otherwise.
5.  Mailing addresses for the speaker packs.

Overall, the response to the 2000 events was extremely positive with a very
high satisfaction rate. Key points from delegate feedback were as follows:

1. The challenge for this course is to maintain the right balance between
theory and practice. Delegates have requested the most advanced research and
mathematical theory for inclusion. The flip-side of the coin is that they
also would like as many practical examples as possible. On the attached
draft, where PRACTICAL EXAMPLE(S) are included as the final bullet point I
would like to include a one line description of the practical example you
will provide for the audience.

2. Delegates have requested more time spent on actual modelling rather than
examinations of quantitative discussions of the energy markets in general.
Again, I think that we provide a good balance between the two.

3. Basically, the audience who attend this are eager to attend the most
advanced financial mathematics course available for energy practitioners. I
think that with the current market developments this approach combined with
the impact of recent events we will have an extremely topical and exciting
event this July.


I look forward to seeing your responses next week. Please contact me to
discuss the existing arrangements for travel and accommodation
reimbursement.

Best wishes,

Attached below is the resume of a student graduating from the University of 
Chicago with an MS in Mathematics.  His specialty is financial mathematics 
and his coursework seems to have covered a lot of the sorts of things that I 
understand your group to do, Vince.  He is extremely interested in Enron and 
contacted me because I am an alum of the College at the U of C.  I gather he 
didn't go through Enron's typical recruiting process for Analysts or 
Associates because his background is more technical, than commercial.  He 
acknowledged that his business experience is limited and from his resume you 
can tell that he is young.  He would therefore be willing to start as an 
Analyst or whatever the equivalent would be for a non-rotating position, but 
his interest is in doing the kind of work that you do, Vince, and Ravi, I 
know you have a similar background.  

Please let me know if this candidate would be of interest to either of you.  
If so, feel free to contact him directly.  He would like to start work this 
summer after graduating in June.

Thanks for your time and I hope this is useful to you.

I am very glad that you have recruited the 2nd PhD student for the research  
project.
We are discussing internally what would be the best topic(s) for the project
and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it.
It makes a lot of sense for you to visit Enron to finalize the selection
of the research topics.

We shall be glad to take both Eric and Giuseppe as summer interns.
Everybody  was immensely impressed with Giuseppe and we shall 
welcome him with open arms.

Credit is going to be a big issue for energy companies and banks.

We may need to form additional discussion groups.

Volatility in energy prices and a general economic slowdown may cause an
increase in defaults.

Banks are primarily interested in regulatory impact on loan portfolio and
credit derivatives as a an alternative to raising capital or selling assets.

Energy companies could use credit derivatives to hedge or price credit
exposure.

1641,"TITLE: CERA Monthly Oil Briefing: Fundamentals Update 
E-mail Category: CERA Monthly Briefing 
CERA Knowledge Area: World Oil 

In the past two weeks, oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength 
that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages 
this winter. The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard 
to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil 
stock situation is at least stabilizing, even if stocks have not built 
substantially, and that, thus far, despite a few weeks of colder-than-normal 
temperatures, heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key 
US market. That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving 
speculative interest into the market. Furthermore, the potential for weakness 
in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001. 

The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that 
Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide, yet, the Iraqi export 
cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals. If the cutoff lasts 
through December, the effect will be pronounced-it would turn a projected 
fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0.5 million barrels per day (mbd) into a 
stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic 
because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions, and 
exports may again cease. At some point such a development would have a price 
supportive effect. 

CERA's price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch 
released in late November. Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or 
repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production, the projected average for first 
quarter 2001 is $29 per barrel for WTI. However, this outlook is based on 
OPEC's announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its 
production by the start of the second quarter. A failure to restrain output 
would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $27 WTI for the first 
quarter of 2001, with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in 
the first. The downward pressure results from the prospect of a 
larger-than-usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 
3.0 mbd-with a cut in OPEC output.

Iraq in a Twilight Zone 
As anticipated, Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UN-controlled ""oil for 
food"" program as of December 1 in protest over the rejection by the Security 
Council's sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule.*

Iraq's pricing was judged by the UN overseers, who monitor the export program 
and advise the sanctions committee, to be about 60 cents per barrel below 
comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that 
Iraq was seeking from buyers.

Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues, Iraq partially 
resumed exporting on December 13. Since then, about 1 mbd has been exported 
from the Mina al-Bakr terminal in the Persian Gulf. Prior to the shutdown, 
Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of 2.21 mbd for November, as 
compared with 2.08 mbd for the third quarter. Exports for November were about 
1.3 mbd from Mina al-Bakr and about 0.9 mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean. 
Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed, owing to the surcharge dispute, with 
the result that about 1.2 mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market.

Iraq's semi-shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its 
dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues. (In the midst of 
this dispute, the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oil-for-food 
program at the last minute on December 5; it became effective on December 6 
and has been accepted by Iraq). As of December19, Iraq's revised export price 
for Ceyhan, proposed for the remainder of December, has again been judged too 
low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions 
committee. Additionally, the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude 
that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow 
account would be a violation of UN sanctions. Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina 
al-Bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a 
surcharge to Iraq.

How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear, but it continues 
to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an 
apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are 
the heart of the sanctions system. The distinction that Iraq has made between 
Mina al-Bakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina al-Bakr by 
loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company. Iraq may have judged this 
accommodation to be in its interest, since it recently also signed an oil 
exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil. As 
currently structured, the deal would violate UN sanctions, but India is 
seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic 
hardship. The exception seems unlikely to be granted, which may lead Iraq to 
cease exports from Mina al-Bakr again.

There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow, but we expect 
uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as 
leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security 
Council to end all restraints. Consequently, the Iraq factor will remain an 
element in the oil price outlook. 

Iraq's antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq 
issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take 
office. Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a 
need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to ""reenergize"" 
sanctions. The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign 
policy-oriented think tank in Washington. A consensus seems to be emerging 
around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by 
retaining UN control over Iraq's oil revenue and strictly enforcing a 
prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general 
trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international 
irritant. There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to 
destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that 
the prospects for success are remote.

Demand Trends 
Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for 
gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so, 
and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas. Interruptible gas 
customers with resid or distillate fuel back-up have already switched to oil, 
so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the 
already high level of distillate demand. So far in December US distillate 
demand is running at a record high December level of 3.9 mbd. However, only a 
small portion of this demand is the result of economically based 
fuel-switching from gas to distillate. CERA estimates that the additional 
demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is 
relatively small, on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mbd. In CERA's view it is likely 
that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short 
notice because in some cases, this theoretically switchable capacity has not 
been used in recent years, and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in 
uncertain condition. 

Switching by interruptible gas customers (such as utilities) to distillate 
began about a month or more ago, although the volumes involved are relatively 
small. Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices 
started to surge in the summer. A portion of the US secondary and tertiary 
distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible 
gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage. Given the 
expectations of a tight gas market, regulators have been explicit about 
enforcing back-up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the 
current heating season. 

Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching. 
Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost 
of feedstock natural gas is high. Natural gas is also used in some enhanced 
oil recovery operations, and some of these producers have also opted to sell 
gas back to the grid rather than produce oil. 

Supply Trends 
Non-OPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0.9 mbd over a 
year earlier at 46.4 mbd. Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican 
production, curtailed in October by about 300,000 bd owing to the effects of 
Hurricane Keith. Mexico's fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be 
3.64 mbd-about 95 percent of Mexican liquids capacity. Norway's output 
increased 200,000 bd from October to November as maintenance season ended. 
Norway's production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3.53 mbd.*

Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a 
recent surge in exports, in spite of higher export taxes. Russian exports of 
domestic oil production (excluding transit volumes) reached 2.5 mbd in 
November, after remaining fairly steady at about 2.35 mbd from July though 
October. Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2.5 mbd, 0.3 mbd 
greater than in the fourth quarter 1999.

CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged 2.91 mbd in November-down 0.1 
mbd from the October level. The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced 
Iraqi output for the first 12 days of December to roughly 0.8 mbd. Iraq 
resumed exports of about 1 mbd on December 13, which raised production to 
1.80 mbd. Assuming no change in Iraq's current production stance, Iraqi 
production would average 1.41 mbd for December. On a quarterly basis, the 
decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth 
quarter of 29.0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0.5 
mbd into a stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. These production estimates include 0.15 mbd 
of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November 20 without UN 
authorization and are continuing.

Oil Stocks 
US crude oil inventories (DOE data) have climbed intermittently from an 
annual low of 280 million barrels in September and reached 292 million 
barrels in mid-December (see Figure 1). Since prices weakened in late 
November, crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September 
and the ranges seen in October to levels from 289-292 million barrels.

Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below year-earlier levels; 
at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels, or 24 percent less, than 
those of a year ago, but there are indications of builds in secondary and 
tertiary inventories. We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up 
5-10 million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at 
the end of last year.

In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with 
those of the United States. In November stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels 
to 426 million barrels. At this level they are below the highs of 1999 but 
well above the low levels of early 1996 (see Figure 2). Japanese crude oil 
inventories at end-October were 107.6 million barrels, which is above the 
record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent 
years (see Figure 3).

Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of
forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be
interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be
interested in receiving this preprint.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,

Valery Kholodnyi
Manager of Quantitative Analysis
Research and Analytics Group

PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for
spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:

1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes 
and
Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00, 
July
2000.
2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000.
3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with 
Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000.
4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at 
Two
Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint
TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000.
5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with 
Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.

As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard
approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a
stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of
spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian
process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is
Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit
valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that
the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the
absence of spikes.

11:30 am:

Objective: Develop a methodology and a model for estimating risks of the EES 
Regulatory portfolio.

Discussion Items:

1. Elements of the Regulatory portfolio

 - Transmission and Distribution (T&D) Positions
 - Bundled Tariffs (full utility tariffs that are in place prior to 
deregulation)
 - Competitive Transition Charges (CTC) Positions
 - Diversification between the three risk elements

2. Risk drivers in each bucket (Scott Stoness of EES to provide more detail)

 - T&D: interest rates
 - Bundled Tariffs: regulatory decisions, power prices, interest rates, 
inflation
 - CTC: power prices, fuel prices, generation valuation, generation stack, 
regulatory decisions

3. Position aggregation parameters (Scott Stoness of EES to provide 
suggestions)

 - by NERC Region
 - by state
 - by utility
 - by utility tariff

4. Model environment

 - Excel
 - GRMS/RisktRAC
 - Other

5. VaR Parameters

 - correlations
 - factor loadings (1-factor model?)
 - other

6. EES specific issues

 - The size of CTC positions is impacted by the roll-off date, which is 
subject to change due to a number of factors (jump diffusion?)
 - T&D and Bundled Tariffs do not move daily, but rather once every 2-3 years 
(event driven?)

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas.

These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.

Enron North America-Upstream Products
Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu.  
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power
Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

However, Norma did ask me to bring a couple of things to your attention:  the

know the newsletter is low priority compared to our daily work, but surely as

1726,"At its special meeting today, FERC released the results of its eagerly 
awaited probe into California's summer power crisis, concluding that under 
certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and 
unreasonable power rates due to California's ""seriously flawed"" market 
structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions 
throughout the West.

The FERC staff report on western markets and the causes of the Summer 2000 
Price Abormalities, entitled, Part I of Staff Report on U.S. Bulk Power 
Markets, is available at the following website: 
http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm

In response, FERC issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural 
changes to the California ISO and PX to help remedy the pricing problems, and 
solicited public comment by November 22.  A technical conference has also 
been scheduled for November 9, to discuss the proposed solutions and other 
remedies that might be suggested (details TBA).  While all four commissioners 
supported the order, the order stretched the Commission.  Chairman Hoecker 
and Comm. Breathitt expressed strong endorsements, while Comms. Hebert and 
Massey concurred, citing areas where they felt the Commission had either 
""over-reached"" or not gone far enough, as discussed below.  A final order is 
expected to be issued by year's end.

At the same time, the Commission warned California consumers of their 
continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve 
state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability of day 
ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand responses; (3) 
siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of sufficient 
reserve requirements.

Highlights of Proposed California Structural Remedy

In its order, FERC proposed a series of market overhauls, including:

(1) Eliminating the state's mandatory requirement that the state's 
investor-owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allowing
these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other 
alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks.

(2) Requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their 
transactions in the day-ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for 
under-scheduling (in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements), in 
order to discourage over-reliance on the real-time spot market.

(3) Establishing independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the ISO 
and PX.

(4) Modifying the current single price auction system by (a) imposing a 
temporary $150/MWh ""soft cap"" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $150 
from setting the market-clearing price for all bidders; (b) requiring sellers 
bidding above $150/MWh to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, weekly 
basis and provide certain cost support; and (c) requiring the ISO and PX to 
report monthly information on such bids.  The Commission's price mitigation 
measures would remain in effect through December 31, 2002.

(5) Declining to order retroactive refunds for the state's ratepayers and 
utilities, citing insufficient authority to do so, but subjecting sellers to 
potential refund liability for transactions from October 2, 2000 until 
December 21, 2002, but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs, if 
FERC finds non-competitive behavior.

(6) Encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand 
response management programs.

Separately, the draft order rejected the ISO's request for an extension of 
its current purchase price cap authority, and the PX's request for price 
capping authority.

Commissioner Responses

Comm. Herbert reluctantly concurred, noting that his decision may change when 
a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at 
the November 9 meeting.  He stressed that he would have preferred that the 
order address four areas: (1) eliminate all price controls in California 
markets; (2) abolish the single price auction entirely; (3) terminate the 
""buy and sell"" mandate in the PX; and (4) direct the ISO to address a long 
list of cited problems in its January 2001 RTO filing, rather than having the 
Commission prescribe specific remedies.

Hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the ""soft cap"" 
concept, if one had to be adopted, then the soft cap should increase 
incrementally increase over time at specific pre-announced dates.  He 
believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in 
facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive 
for California regulators to address market design and other flaws.  Also, he 
would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time, but 
allow the ISO and PX to address this issue in their January 2001 RTO 
filings.  In addition, he would not dictate risk management methods, 
preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on 
their own.  Finally, he advised Californians not to be so environmentally 
focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation 
capacity.

Comm. Breathitt stated her approval of the Order while warning that FERC 
cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress 
towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that it was the Commission's 
job to guide the market to self-correct and not to conduct ""command and 
control.""  She also commended the managers of the ISO and PX, saying that 
they have performed admirably.  However, she noted she is awaiting comments 
on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential 
reporting requirements.

Comm. Massey concurred, but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive 
approach.  He feels that the Congress has ""put its thumb on the scale"" in the 
Federal Power Act to protect consumers.  Stating that prices will continue to 
be unreasonable in the future, he believes that this Order moves in the right 
direction, by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over 
reliance on the spot market, lack of demand response, the need to 
reconstitute governance of the ISO and PX and the elimination of the buy/sell 
mandate.  Comm. Massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the 
$150/MWh soft cap went far enough, whether FERC has the legal authority to 
issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a 
certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market 
price volatility.

Finally, Chairman Hoecker stated his strong support of the Order, but noted 
that this is ""no time to pull punches.""  He emphasized that the Commission 
needed frank comments from the industry.  He echoed Comm. Breathitt's warning 
that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on 
track.  Noting that the Commission lacked authority to order refunds, he 
stated that the responsibility rests with Congress.  Addressing 
jurisdictional issues, he stated that siting problems encountered at the 
state level are slowing the ""meandering transition"" to competition.  He feels 
that the state of California and FERC need to work together to resolve these 
problems and that FERC is not attempting to usurp power.  Rather, California 
is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region 
for reliable energy, thus placing the burden on federal action to make things 
work, Hoecker maintained.  The Chairman also said that the Commission will 
fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further 
evidence provided by staff's ongoing investigation.

Yes, it might be more productive to talk on the phone.  Given our time
difference, why don't we plan on tomorrow (Friday) 8:00AM PDT, 4:00PM BDT?  My
number in the states is 503-464-8430.  Give me your number, too, so that I can
call back if I get hung up in a meeting or something.

The situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the
capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour, but
in constructing the stack, increments of a plant may be scattered throughout
the stack, based on their respective incremental heat rates.  (This is why
increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model.)  Results for
the capacity increments, however, are not available as output; only each
plant's aggregate values are reported.

I had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a
Homer City, NY plant we were studying a few years ago.  Attached is the SQL
query you can import into MS ACCESS to do the same thing for you (making
appropriate modifications to the year, hour, etc.)  Unfortunately, no Henwood
documentation on the output variables existed when I created this query, so I
can not really tell you what they represent anymore.  An acquaintance of mine
at Entergy and I were lobbying to get Henwood to provide some documentation,
so it may be available now.

Let's talk and maybe we can help you out,
Michael

",Karolina Henwood Michael,,SQL MS ACCESS
1728,"Chonawee,

As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad 
decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).

Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option.
You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to 
$100.  
You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise 
gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes
on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is
28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against
ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes. 

Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option 
position
as an offset.

The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the
tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have 
income in the
future (or capital gains).

Not so good.

By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options
is a very interesting and difficult problem.

1731,"SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN 2000 
   
 06/19/2000 
 Petroleum Finance Week 
 (c) 2000 Phillips Business Information, Inc. 

 Oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and 
production expenditures by more than they anticipated
 at the beginning of the year, Lehman Brothers Inc. found in a mid-year 
update of its annual E&P survey. ""The 326 companies
 we surveyed are planning on an 18.2 percent increase, versus a 10.2 percent 
rise budgeted in December,"" said James D.
 Crandell, who follows oil services and drilling for the New York investment 
banker.

 He emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in Lehman's survey reflects 
increases in budgets for 2000 and not
 underspending of budgets during 1999. ""Among the companies that were 
included in our December 1999 and May 2000
 surveys, global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated 
to have been spent during 1999 in December. It
 also indicates that nearly $6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide 
exploration budgets since December,"" Crandell said.

 The survey's respondents said that they planned to increase U.S. E&P 
expenditures by 17.6 percent, up from 15.9 percent
 earlier in the year. Crandell said that the greater increase was driven 
almost entirely by independent producers. ""In our survey,
 227 independents indicated E&P spending growth in 2000 of 26.1 percent 
versus a 22.9 percent increase budgeted for the
 year in December,"" he indicated. ""Some 40 percent of the independents we 
surveyed have increased their U.S. E&P budgets,
 while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last 
December. Higher natural gas prices and increased
 cash flow are the main drivers behind this.""

 Crandell said that Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: APC), Apache Corp. (NYSE: 
APA), BHP Petroleum, H.S. Resources Inc.
 (NYSE: HSE), McMoRan Exploration Co. (NYSE: RAN), MDU Resources Group Inc. 
(NYSE: MDU), Mitchell Energy and
 Development Corp. (NYSE: MND.A and MND.B), Santa Fe Snyder Corp. (NYSE: 
SFS), Stone Energy Corp. (NYSE: SGY) and
 Titan Exploration Inc. - now Pure Resources Inc. (NYSE: PRS) - were among 
the larger independents to make the most
 significant upward revisions. The ones that significantly reduced planned 
U.S. E&P outlays for the year included Barrett
 Resources Corp. (NYSE: BRR), Belco Oil and Gas Corp. (NYSE: BOG), Burlington 
Resources Inc. (NYSE: BR), Coastal Corp.
 (NYSE: CGP), Forcenergy Inc. (NYSE: FEN), Houston Exploration Co. (NYSE: 
HEX), Kerr-McGee Corp. (NYSE: KMG), Mariner
 Energy Corp. and Williams Production Co.

 The survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage 
gain in their 2000 U.S. E&P expenditures (8.8
 percent) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year (8.4 percent). 
Among the 14 companies in this category, 31
 percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 E&P spending estimates 
during the first six months, including Amerada Hess
 Corp. (NYSE: AHC), Conoco Inc. (NYSE: COC.A and COC.B), Occidental Petroleum 
Corp. (NYSE: OXY)and Total Fina Elf S.A.
 (NYSE: TOT). Another 19 percent - including ENI SpA (NYSE: E), Royal 
Dutch/Shell (NYSE: RDP and STT) and Texaco Inc.
 (NYSE: TX) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates, while the 
remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey
 remained the same.

 'The increase in Canada... is nothing short of staggering...'

 ""The increase in Canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is 
nothing short of staggering,"" Crandell continued. Of
 the 85 companies that he contacted, 44.7 percent budgeted higher 
expenditures for 2000 than for 1999. ""Compared with
 December, 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000 
by more than 10 percent, while 20 percent
 have reduced it by more than 10 percent. The remaining 39 percent have kept 
it within 10 percent of what was originally
 estimated,"" Crandell said. Talisman Energy Inc. (NYSE: TLM) led the group 
with a huge increase, followed by Anderson
 Exploration Ltd. (TSE: AXL), Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. (NYSE: GOU), Murphy 
Oil Corp. (NYSE: MUR), Pan Canadian
 Petroleum Ltd. (TSE: PCP) and Shell Canada Ltd. (TSE: SHC). Like their U.S. 
counterparts, producers above the border raised
 their 2000 E&P budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash 
flow, according to the Lehman analyst.

 He said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise: ""The 14.9 
percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas
 companies that have operations outside the United States and Canada was well 
above the 5.7 percent increase for 2000
 estimated last December. As in other geographies, there were more companies 
that increased budgets than decreased them.""
 Overall, Crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised 
their 2000 E&P budgets by more than 10 percent, 43
 estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated 
that they would spend less than originally planned.
 He said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which 
materially increased their budgets, including
 Texaco, Petroleos Brasileiros S.A., Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. and Repsol YPF 
S.A. (NYSE: REP) among the multinationals and
 Amerada Hess, Apache, Premier Oil Plc. and Woodside Energy among mid-sized 
companies.

 Crandell noted that while respondents' average price assumptions rose during 
2000's first six months (to $22.04 from $19.25
 per barrel of crude oil and to $2.58 from $2.38 per thousand cubic feet of 
natural gas), they still trail current prices and what
 Lehman Brothers estimates for the year ($28 per barrel of crude and $3.30 
per Mcf of gas). ""This suggests a stronger second
 half than expected, should companies raise budgets further to reflect the 
higher prices,"" he said.

1764,"The attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the 
Commission this afternoon, in order to provide FERC staffers a concise, 
effective statement of our position while they drafted the Judge's 
recommendation.  I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner, at which 
Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the 
following high points: 

1.  The methodology of the June 19 order does not work and is totally 
inappropriate for marketers.  If price mitigation is inevitable, the Judge 
should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology.

2.  The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order 
must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and 
after October 2.

3.  All buyers, including Enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just the 
State of California and its IOU's.  Enron is a net purchaser in these markets.

4.  Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the 
methodology, not bilateral contracts, OOM sales or sales to the DWR. 

The details of these points appear in the attached document.  The Judge was 
receptive to most points.  He understood the problems that the June 19 
methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this 
should be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form 
part of his recommendation.  He agreed that the actual buyers should receive 
refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be 
subject to the refund methodology.  Although he agreed that the refund 
methodology, once implemented, should yield just and reasonable rates, he 
felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the 
matter was up to the Commission.  The Judge spoke generally and no promises 
were made as to the content of his recommendations, but hopefully this 
insight will shed some light as to the outcome.  I urged the Judge to 
recommend placing conditions to refunds, as the Commission did in its June 19 
order with its RTO filing requirement.  The judge was noncommittal on this, 
although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset.

Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday.  The Judge told 
us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday, and that 
the comments would accompany the recommendation.  Thereafter, it is likely 
that the Commission would defer to the Judge's recommendation to hold a fast 
track evidentiary hearing of 60 days duration, to determine ""unresolved 
issues of material fact"".  The scope of the hearing has not been determined, 
but  will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for 
marketers to recommend an alternative methodology.

see, it's a relatively brief ""overview"" presentation for Jeff, not going into 
much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and 
evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).  The 
main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December 
Board meeting.

I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with 
McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for 
talent.  A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity 
and reduced hierarchy in an organization.  It also creates substantial upside 
opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.  My 
question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes 
to attracting and retaining talent.  My suspicion is that our turnover is 
farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the 
organization.  Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have 
some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often 
lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and 
that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors 
(ie we're OK at the top livels already).  Could you have someone do an 
analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?  We may need to weed out 
the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a 
low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for 
performance reasons) if possible.

 OPIC, EXIM and the Department of State each raised the issue of Trakya 
withTurkish Minister of Economy Dervis yesterday reflecting a unified front 
of the USG on the issue.
 Harmon, Chairman of EXIM, apparently did not go into great detail on the 
situation but EXIM staff had a side conversation with the Deputy Sec'y of 
Treasury in which the issue was addressed in greater detail.
 At the OPIC meeting, OPIC focused on Trakya and went through the situation 
in great detail.  Minister Dervis was not aware of all the details, but is 
now.  He stated that the sector had to be cleaned up.  He noted that the IMF 
deal had to first be struck but that the energy sector had to be addressed in 
the ""near term"".   Drumheller's sense was that in the next several weeks 
there would be definite action on the part of Treasury or both Trakya and the 
USG need to take further steps.  He wants to go ahead and meet with the 
lenders with an eye towards preparing the letters re the guarantee and then 
gear up if necesary to beat on the GOT.
 Alan Larson, Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs also spoke to 
Dervis and stated to the Minister that the continuation of the Trakya 
situation would become a major public issue between the US and Turkey.  That 
this is now the official position of the Department of State is a huge step 
forward.  Thanks John",Dervis Alan Larson,,OPIC EXIM the Department of State USG Treasury State for Economic Affairs

our message should generally be:
We support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers.  
We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to 
procure power on a fixed price basis from the market.  San Diego has offers 
in front of it now; those should be evaluated and the legislature and the 
commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of 
them.  This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later 
recovered from consumers.
Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform.  Rate caps have bad long 
term consequences: they cause shortages.  Combining short-medium term rate 
relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term 
problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?		Legislators Prepare to Address SoCal Bailout Options 
?	$5.7B Revenue Notes Request in State Treasurer's Hands

Bonds & Bankruptcy:

The Edison MOU is expected to be the major issue on the political agenda this week, and the legislative leadership wants to pass some bail-out measure by this Friday (8/24).  While analysts are confident that there will be an MOU passed, many are skeptical that the current proposals will be able to cobble together 41 votes in the Assembly.  The Davis Administration has said proceeds from the November bond sale will be used to repay the $6.2B borrowed from General Fund to purchase energy.  However, repeated delays in the bond sale have caused concern. And PG&E is upset that the money will be first used to pay off the state without offsetting some of the funds the state owes PG&E.

Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox has said that his members will not vote for any plan that is not a clean bailout (i.e. without additional provisions related to environmental mitigation).  Thus, he is essentially saying his members will vote for Assembly Member Rod Wright's proposal, and no other current plan.  But Wright's proposal does not have much support from Democrats.  Sources report that at least one prominent legislator, Senator Mike Machado, has apparently remarked that he is not certain of the need to pass an MOU.  Others may be muttering similar things, but an MOU is still likely.

Strangely, though, no discussions were held at the staff level this week on MOU legislation.  The key driver in the MOU debate is how much of a ""haircut"" SCE will be required to take (as a hit to the parent company).  Sources report that SCE will accept a haircut of $500M. However, should the haircut be placed in the range of $1B, we are told that SCE's Bryson has informed his team that he would take SCE into bankruptcy voluntarily. This represents a significant turnaround in SCE's previous optimism, which is attributable to legislative indifference to the SCE bankruptcy threat as well as growing tension between Bryson and Governor Davis.  As for the middle range between $500M and $1B, it is difficult to ascertain how high SCE will go before pulling the bankruptcy trigger.

Short Term-Anticipatory Notes

State Controller Kathleen Connell has asked for an emergency sale of a $5.7B short term note (possibly in the form of a Revenue Anticipation Note/RAN) to cover California's electricity costs until November, when $12.4B in state bonds are expected to be issue by the Legislature.  The State Controller's request was made because of her legal obligation to issue a demand to the Treasurer at any time she determines that the General Fund has or will have insufficient funds for the payment of all appropriations by the Legislature.  Connell claims the RAN, which could be offered as early as September, is necessary because the state's general fund is running dry from recent power purchases.  

State Treasurer Angelides is studying the plan, but has yet to publicly comment.  According to sources, he has also yet to comment to legislators, but was in New York last week meeting with people on Wall Street about the bond issuance.  Mandated by state statute, Angelides can issue these notes unilaterally and does not need approval from the Legislature or anyone else.  He has total discretion on the issuance, its timing, and its amount.  However, the state's general fund would not be depleted by November 15th, even without the RAN revenue.  RANs are not that unusual.  RANs were previously issued from FY 95-96 through FY 99-00 with the largest being the $5B RAN in FY 92-93.  Because of California's recent economic growth, RANs were not necessary last year and were expected to be unnecessary this year. 

Concerns surrounding the PG&E suit filed earlier last week (PG&E seeks priority in the $12B revenue bond allocations) are somewhat eased by a well-placed utility source who report that the suit will have little impact the revenue bond or anticipatory notes' issuance.  However, there is suspicion among some that the Administration is increasingly concerned that investor confidence is weakening and that the bond issuance might be deemed a failure, and is thus promoting the idea that PG&E's actions are responsible, rather than investor uncertainty over revenue stream allocation and DWR contracts.  In the event that the revenue bonds' issuance is delayed past the October 31st bridge loan maturity, the interest rate charged to the state would reportedly jump from four percent to seven percent.",Dave Cox Rod Wright Wright Mike Machado Bryson Davis Kathleen Connell Connell Treasurer Angelides Angelides,5.7B 6.2B $500M.

1801,"Palmer said Enron could protect consumers from electricity price spikes by
entering into ""hedging"" agreements with local utilities, which are
contracts that provide guaranteed pricing for certain periods. He said the

1802,"It looks like there are about 12 articles in the San Diego Union concerning 
bidders in the San Diego market. Following are other articles and letter to 
the editor.



SDG&E is entertaining offers from major power companies for a fixed-price
contract to stabilize electricity prices. The utility has received at least
one proposal from Enron Corp. for a multiple-year contract at prices less
than half current levels -- but 50 percent above prices in the spring.



""It's like apples and oranges,"" said Thomas Williams, the Duke spokesman. 
He noted that Roseville had recently secured power at 4.9 cents from Enron
-- a Duke competitor -- but had signed a five-year contract.



Letters to the Editor

The real reason our electric rates are so high is because San Diego Gas &
Electric made a major goof by selling off all its power plants to other
utilities. That's why only San Diego County is suffering from deregulation.

The rest of the state is being served by other utilities that have plants. 
They can produce electricity for about 11 cents per kilowatt hour. They do
not need much of the California power pool electricity.

However, SDG&E's parent company, Sempra, has no local power generators and
is forced to take all of its electricity from the pool, which is being
exploited by large out-of-state utilities, such as Enron, which is charging
25 cents per kilowatt hour. The California power pool sells all power at
the same rates, but only Sempra is forced to buy large quantities.

I find it difficult to believe your readers are surprised by the recent
rise in electricity rates. Opponents to deregulation predicted the outcome
some years ago before AB 1847 was passed. Anyone with a simple education in
economics would foresee that with deregulation the utilities would direct
their marketing at the largest users who would lock in low rates by
contract. In the end, the individual homeowner would pay for any rate
increases.

Advising people to lock in a rate with Enron or a similar company will not
resolve the problem. Someone somewhere at the lower end of the food chain
will have to pay the deregulated power rate.

If one had even read AB 1847, one would have discovered that the initial 10
percent rate reduction was paid for by issuance of state bonds and guess
who will pay those off. As you may now realize, the power generation
industries in California and New York were not interested in any studies
based on reality, which were discarded.

The public's lack of diligence with pending legislation will be paid for by
the same public. The studies were available, but I guess that initial rate
reduction was more appealing.

The real statement and fresh resolve from Peace are his apology to all of
his constituents that relied on and voted for him, to reverse and fix this
ridiculous mistake.

I hope he had our best interests at heart when he bought into this idea. 
Who specifically lobbied him for this? Has anyone else noticed the

  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs 
  By Rebecca Smith 
    
  09/01/2000 
  The Wall Street Journal 
  Page A4 
  (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents 
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of 
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll 
back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 
cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable 
costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far 
higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market 
has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by 
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, 
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near 
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as 
well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by 
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked 
$150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs 
if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be 
expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is ""deeply flawed"" because it limits the amount prices can 
rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for 
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until 
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices 
through
  December 2002. ""It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,"" he said because it 
""creates
  tremendous uncertainty"" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company 
to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the 
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of 
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

I read your message regarding the meeting with TransAlta and other Alberta 
marketers with interest.  My immediate thoughts are as follows.

Obviously, you should keep the discussions entirely to problems experienced 
with B.C. Hydro/Powerex foreclosure of transmission capacity.

If the project proceeds, the coalititon should appoint a limited number of 
people to carry the project and report back to participants.

The working group should ensure that their proceedings include outside 
counsel who had or have some knowledge of antitrust, as well as the 
regulatory issues.

The coalition should stay as close as possible to government.  For example, 
they should try to involve Alberta officials in the project if possible.

My guess is the Competition Bureau will take the view that regulatorys (B.C., 
NEB, FERC) have primary jurisdiction, but the Bureau may be an ally in 
dealing with regulators.  Do you know who at the Bureau TransAlta talked to 
about their concerns?  This may also have some bearing on the extent to which 
Enron should openly participate in the project.

unneccesary.   Allows states to ban MTBE.
allowing states to waive the federal requirement that RFG contain 2% oxygen 
by weight
a new ""Clean Alternative Fuels Program"" that mandates use of primarily 
ethanol from .6% in 2002 to 1.5% in 2015
authorizes the use of Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) funds to 
remediate MTBE spills, and add $200 million to the LUST fund.

The markup saw a number of amendments from the Republican side, but Smith 
(R-N.H.) sided with committee Democrats at to defeat most, setting the stage 
for a rough road ahead for the bill before it can move any further in the 
Senate.  Particularly the ethanol mandate is bringing opposition from 
refiners, auto makers, and highway construction/users groups.  There will 
also be serious opposition going forward from a number of MTBE supporters in 
the Senate.   

The ""no"" votes and supporters of MTBE industry at the markup were Senators 
James Inhofe (R-OK), Kit Bond (R-MO), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), John 
Warner (R-VA), Craig Thomas (R-WY) and Robert Bennett (R-UT).   Senate 
Majority Whip Don Nickles (R-OK) has also indicated he will oppose the bill 
going forward.  The MTBE industry lobbied vigorously to try to gain support 
for amendments and defeat the bill, but most realized in advance that this 
outcome was not possible.  

From Enron's perspective, however, the markup was not entirely discouraging.  
In fact, we gained commitments by both Republican and Senate leaders to 
address our primary issue -- transition funding for MTBE producers affected 
by a ban of the product -- before the Smith bill moves to the Senate floor.   
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison offered an amendment that we drafted, providing 
transition funding for MTBE producers who would have to retrofit their plants 
to produce other chemicals.   While the measure was defeated by voice vote, 
Chairman Smith agreed there should be transition funding, but said he could 
not support the amendment because the MTBE industry would not support an MTBE 
ban.   Smith did commit that he would work with Hutchison and MTBE producers 
before the bill goes to the Senate floor to achieve an acceptable compromise.

In addition, Senator Inhofe, Chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee, offered 
a ""liability relief"" amendment, among several amendments he offered to the 
bill.   The amendment was aimed at providing ""liability relief"" to producers 
and distributors of MTBE, who face potential ""toxic tort"" lawsuits because of 
groundwater contamination.   The amendment was defeated by voice vote, and it 
will likely be a difficult fight to gain traction on this issue going forward.

Our task in the coming weeks will be to get MTBE producers to agree on the 
details of a transition package, and agree to back off somewhat on opposing 
the MTBE ban in exchange for this transition package.

I have attached a summary of the legislation, and a list of the amendments 
that were offered at the markup.   Please e-mail or call if you have 
questions or require additional information.  (202-466-9157)

1819,"I talked  with Jamie  Rosenfeld,  the   CERA  SVP     and he  said Dan Yergin 
is 
very much interested in this  type of   advocacy  and  right now is highly 
sought out by TV  and   print media  on these  same   issues which are of 
concern  to Enron -- on  supply  security,  managing  price volatility  and 
supply  turmoil, avoiding regulatory  backlash,  and promoting just  letting 
the  market  work .  Beyond   Dan  taking   media  referrals  and  an Op  Ed 
--  they suggested   several more  ideas.  

1.  November  1-2  is  CERA's Houston Conference Roundtable.  The  day 
before  the Conference Enron  could host  a special  session,  a top 100  
Leadership Circle, or  a special dinner  and   dinnner /speaker  to which key 
media  would  be  invited.  Enron  could  invite  special  attendees  like  
PUC, NARUC  ,  Congressional  types  and other Opiniion Leaders  to attend.  
We  would   get the  shadow  benefit  of   1500-2000  attendees  and media  
in town  for the  Roundtable  the next  day.  

2.
In concert with the  recent  release  of   the   CERA  Electric Power  Trends 
publication,  CERA  would quickly  prepare  a  similar  short  version of  a 
Natural  Gas Trends publication (much is on the shelf   already)  and  
Enron   could  purchase  bulk   copies of  each .  We  could  use a  custom  
cover letter  from  Ken and/or Jeff   as the opportunity  to  inform    PUC  
chairs, key  Members  of  Congress,  the  two  Presidential  campaigns' 
leadership  and other Opinion leaders about  issues of importance  to Enron  
and its   businesses  -- this merges nicely  with
the  pro  energy  choice, pro markets, pro deregulation  messages contained 
in the  text and  graphics of  Cera's  Trends  publications.

3.
Enron  could   sponsor     a  10 minute  and  or even  a 30- 40 minute   
Energy  Security  themed  multi media  presentation  full of  intellectual 
content  addressing the  key  electricity  and gas  reliability  and pro 
market forces  messages  Enron is  espousing .We would   advise  target 
audiences in  a  letter  as to how to access  the show on the Cera  media  
center  on their  web site  and  Cera  could  do this in concert with   
EBS.   Or  it   could  be  an add- on  to  the  Trends  publication/ letter  
send  out.  In any case  the multi media message  gets the  advantage of  
exposure  to  the 10 000  eyeballs  the  CERA  site   already offers. 

4.   In Feb  CERA  has  its  Houston Executive  Conference.  If  we have  a  
rough  winter  that  could  be  great timing
for  Enron  to  use this  as a Problem Solving and Policy Setting Forum  for 
a  high level   'how  to'  Workshop --and/or   invite  in  some  natural  gas 
and electricity  end  users  and/or  gas distributor speakers  from  the   
buy side that  ""did it  right""  and  can  talk  about   how they  hedged  or  
set  up their  portfolios    to make it  successfully through a  tough  
winter market.  Security  analyst speakers talking  about   doing it the  
right  way  would also be  useful.

My   thought  is  that   Item   2.    sending  the  Trends  publications   
coupled with   brief  multi media  messaging
(from  Item 3) might  give us the bigger   impact  faster and more  
targeted   than  the others.  

 Do any of  these  appeal   to  you  ?

1830,"Hi Laura:  I've attached three things, but first wanted to give you a bit of 
an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities 
Commission.  

Move to Prohibit Customer Choice
As you may know, AB1X, the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the 
Governor signed, gives the California Department of Water Resources the 
authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities.  Included in that bill, 
however, is a provision that prohibits ""Direct Access,""  California's term 
for customer choice.  

In sum, the bill, in its current form, prohibits businesses and consumers 
from chosing an alternative energy service provider, like Enron.  Our 
understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition.  
Their reasoning is that they need a ""captive"" customer base to pay for the 
bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWR's power purchases.

Customer choice was of course the foundation of California's restructuring 
law, AB 1890, and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally 
flawed plan.  For example, the only businesses and consumers that were 
protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those 
businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with 
competitive service providers.  Ironically, the recently passed legislation 
takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage 
their energy costs.  Before AB 1890, consumers and businesses had one 
choice--the monopoly  utility.  With the passage of AB 1X, they again will 
have one choice. But this time their only choice will be to buy from a 
government agency DWR.

A broad coalition of consumer groups has expressed its opposition to the 
prohibition and Senator Debra Bowen (a key player on the Senate side), and 
Fred Keeley (a key player on the Assembly side), have promised to ""fix"" the 
prohibition in another bill ""SB27X.""  I'll forward in another email the 
language that the coalition has drafted and hopes Bowen and Keeley will carry.

Unfortunately, we are now hearing rumors that the Governor intends to direct 
the California Public Utilities to immediately implement the provisions of 
AB1X prohibiting Direct Access, despite the fact that a large coalition of 
consumers and service providers are actively working with Bown and Keeley to 
amend the prohibition language.

It would be extremely useful if the folks participating in the meeting on 
Thursday with the Governor let him know that taking choices away from 
businesses and customers is the wrong way to go and that he and the 
legislative leaders need to work with the coalition to fix it.  You'll note 
in the language developed by the coalition that the proposal strikes a 
reasonable balance between the Dept of Finance's concerns about recouping 
DWR's costs of buying power, and the need to give consumers and businesses 
maximum flexible in managing their energy costs.

Move to Have the State Take Over the Electric Industry in California

John Burton, the Democratic leader of the Senate, insists that, ""if 
California is going to 'bail out' the utilities, the State needs to get 
something in return.""  Burton wants the state to buy and operate PG&E's and 
Edison's transmission system and create a state power authority that would 
get in the business of (among other things) developing, financing, 
constructing and operating power plants and natural gas pipelines.  Burton 
got both of these bills designed to take over the industry passd out of his 
committee yesterday (SB6X and SB33X).  It is unclear how much support he has 
in the full Senate or in the Assembly, but the possibility of passage is 
certainly greater than zero at this juncture.

Others experts are offering a better alternative.  When the federal 
government helped Chrysler out of its financial difficulties 20 years ago, 
the federal government received stock warrants in return.  Until recently, 
the Governor favored warrants, but more recently he has waivered in his 
statements regarding a state take over.  Burton appears to have negotiating 
leverage with the Governor and appears to be using it.

Again, it would be extremely useful for folks to let the Govenor know in the 
meetings on Thursday that a State take over of the industry is an extreme 
move and bad public policy.  I will forward to you in a separate email 
letters that we sent to Burton expressing our opposition to his bills and the 
reasons for our opposition.  In brief, there is no shortage of private 
capital ready and willing to invest in California's energy infrastructure 
(i.e., power plants, electric transmission lines, gas pipelines).  All 
California needs to do is create the investment climate necessary to attract 
the capital.  In addition, history shows that the State is extremely 
ill-equipped to become California's mega-utility. 

Here are the attachments:

A demand buy-down proposal.  We made this proposal to the Governor (and 
continue to propose it to policymakers in Sacramento, Washington D.C. and 
just about everywhere else).  In short, the notion is that, if the market is 
willing to pay power producers, say, 7 cents/kwh to ""produce"" power, then the 
market ought to be willing to pay businesses and consumers 7 cents/kwh to 
""reduce"" power consumption.  

This approach is critical for two reasons:  first, it provides businesses and 
consumers the financial incentives necessary (and that California currently 
lacks) to conserve energy and use energy more efficiently.  Second, because 
California delayed identifying and implementing a solution to California's 
energy crisis, its options for addressing the severe shortages that are 
likely occur this summer are very limited.  Reducing demand represents one of 
the few options that can help to immediately reduce the gap between supply 
and demand.  Putting financial incentives in place now to reduce demand and 
""free up"" electrons is an investment with significant payback.

A ""manifesto"" recently released by a group of Berkeley and Stanford 
economists and industry experts urging the Govenor to pursue a 
""market-oriented"" solution to California's energy crisis.

An editorial in yesterday's Wall Street Journal by Dan McFadden, a nobel 
prize-winning economist from Berkeley echoing the proposal advanced in the 
""manifesto.""  McFadden was one of the manifesto's signatories.

Finally, we are working on ""model Legislation"" proposing a market-based 
solution that we will share with you soon and that we hope the business 
community--and the Valley in particular--can embrace and advocate.

I realize that this is a lot of information and I apologize for the length of 
this note, but I wanted to try to make sure that you're up-to-date.  Please 
don't hesitate to give me a call if you'd like to discuss further.

Best,
Jeff

Follow - up to our first meeting -

We had very good participation.  In the absence of some technical 
difficulties, we would have had 100% participation.  

As our discussion showed, people bring different issues and needs to the 
group.  It seems that this group will function best if we serve as a source 
of information and resources to each other.  Our collective knowledge is 
capable of helping many different individual problems; we just need to figure 
how to get the right information to the people who need it.  Our first task 
should be to sort through this wide ranging topic and start to focus on some 
specific deliverables.

Attached is an updated roster of the team, and a listing of the subgroups and 
some ideas of what the subgroup should consider.  These ideas are not meant 
to restrict but give some additional clarity.  Please note the subgroup 
membership and the designated team leads, and begin your discussions.

Our next meeting will be Friday, February 4, 9:30 am - 11 am Central Standard 
Time.  More details on phone/video conferencing and a full agenda will be 
given later.  At the meeting, each subgroup should share with the larger

He is currently negotiating with the IOUs.   He expects positive news
next week, however, only two of the three IOUs are open to his plan at
this point.  He did not indicate which IOU is holding out, but it has
been widely reported that PG&E does not like his plan.

He has received informal signals from FERC that they are not adverse to
state ownership of the grid.

He expects the ""significant contribution"" from the parent companies to
exceed the previously reported tax refund.

He refused to give a projected price for the grid other then to say it
would be some multiple of book.

His office has briefed both the Senate and Assembly Democrats.  He
believes Democrats will reach agreement on a legislative package by the
end of next week, and vote that package out by the end of the following
week.

He continues to speak to generators, however he has not briefed them
specifically on this plan.  He hopes this plan will provide assurances
to generators that he is working towards a solution but he can not
guarantee that the new IOU funds will cover existing debt.

He acknowledged that eminent domain would likely lead to a significant
withdrawal of private capital and continues to believe his plan is
feasible.

Good morning.  

As a follow up to the voice mail that I left for you, following are some 
background and preparatory notes for a potential phone call today between 
Chancellor Reed and yourself.  Communications and indications from the UC/CSU 
team are that he may call you today as a follow up to your discussion with 
him on February 2, 2001.  As I mentioned at the Executive Committee meeting 
on Tuesday, 2/20/01, all things are moving along well in California with our 
clients, PG&E and SCE.  The current exception to the ""smooth sailing"" is 
UC/CSU.  Tom Riley, the account manager for UC/CSU, has prepared the 
following outline of business concerns, sequence of events and suggested 
talking points.

Ken, thank you for your assistance and continued participation with this 
client.

Regards - Dan



******************************************************************************
*********************
Business Concerns

UC and CSU have business concerns regarding Enron's action to De-DASR their 
accounts.  They have not communicated their concerns with enough detail that 
would allow us to address them, but I have been able to surmise that they 
consist of the following:

1.  UC/CSU is now a bundled access customer instead of a direct access 
customer.  AB-1X, recently signed by Gov. Davis, has ban language preventing 
large commercial/industrial customers from going Direct Access.  Per Jeff 
Dasovich of Enron Gov. Affairs, it is not clear, but possible, that if we had 
not De-DASRed the accounts, that UC/CSU might have been grandfathered as a 
direct access customer.  Further, SB-27X (still pending), which is Senator 
Bowen's attempt to reverse the ban language of AB-1X, may have a financial 
ramification for customers switching to and from Direct Access status.  
Dasovich is investigating further.

2.  UC and CSU bought approximately 130 meters from Enron as we implemented 
the contract.  Our action is forcing the utility to remove these 
University-owned meters, meaning that their meters will become useless.  We 
are currently using those meters to provide daily 15 minute interval data as 
required in our contract. (Our operations and billing group have come up with 
a transition plan that SCE has agreed to. SCE would install dual-sockets 
allowing for the installation of the SCE meter, while keeping our meter in 
tact, mitigating their concern.  At this point, UC and CSU are not listening 
to our business solutions so we have not received feedback from them on this 
solution).

3.  We have a contractual obligation to be the Universities scheduling 
coordinator (SC).  As a result of our action, we are no longer their SC.  
They are concerned this may inhibit our ability to act as their SC for their 
recent proposal to the ISO under the Demand Reduction Program.



Sequence of Events

February 1 - I informed the UC/CSU electricity oversight board leaders and 
contract administrators of Enron's decision.  I walked through the power 
point presentation.  They expressed no concerns at that point, and even 
expressed appreciation we were standing by our contract.  I sent the UC and 
CSU contract administrators the letter later that day advising them of our 
decision.

February 2 - Ken Lay called Chancellor Reed assuring the Chancellor that we 
will honor the contract.  I have since heard that this call was extremely 
well received and that the CSU campus VPs have been advised of the call and 
Ken's assurances that were communicated.  We offered the call to the UC 
President as well, but were channeled to his SVP.  By the time I made contact 
with the SVPs administrator, we had begun receiving letters (below), so I 
backed off on arranging the call.

February 5 - UC and CSU contract administrators inform us they have been 
speaking to their regulatory advisor and asked for some clarifications.  
Maureen Palmer and I speak to the contract administrators and answer their 
questions.  

February 8/9 - UC and CSU send letters to their PG&E and SCE account managers 
advising them they have concerns regarding Enron's decision, and that they 
(PG&E and SCE) should only De-DASR on the Universities' request.

February 12 - I received a letter from the UC/CSU contract administers asking 
for clarifications regarding our action, and requesting we re-DASR their 
accounts.

February 14 - I responded with a letter providing them with responses to 
their clarification questions, but did not offer to re-DASR their accounts as 
they had requested.

February 16 - UC informed me they were unhappy we did not comply with their 
request to re-DASR and indicated they would be sending another letter.  I 
suspect this letter will express potential legal recourses.

February 20 - CSU and UC informed they would hold off on the letter pending 
outcome of a call between Chancellor Reed and Ken Lay.

Throughout the entire process, I have been asking that the business 
administrators meet with us so Enron can hear their concerns.  I gather CSU 
would like to do this, however, UC is more inclined to write letters and seek 
legal remedies.



Suggested Talking Points for Call and Desired Outcome


1.  We were faced with a difficult business decision, and made our California 
decision with our customers in mind.  We have kept our contracts in tact.  
Other energy service providers have left the market and their customers.

2.  We are an energy outsourcing company.  We should source supply from the 
""best available"" source in the marketplace. We feel we have a contractual 
right to have made the decision.

3.  Desired outcome is that we want to sit down with the University business 
administrators to listen to and address their concerns.  We have not been 
afforded this opportunity to date though we have offered.  However, the 
Chancellor needs to understand we are not willing to re-DASR their accounts 
in the meantime.



I will be available for the debrief with Ken if desired.  I can be reached at 
925-543-3703 (office), or 925-548-0326 (mobile) if you have any questions.

Regards, Tom

I mentioned that my brother, an attorney in New York, is active in state 
politics and might be a useful contact in the state. I'm following up with 
this note to let you know a bit more about him. 

Larry Mandelker is a partner with Kantor, Davidoff Wolfe Mandelker & Kass in 
New York City. He is outside counsel to the Republican State Committee and 
represented Bill Powers when he recently joined the Crane Group in Albany. 
Larry works closely with the Crane Group's legal operation, Crane Green & 
Parente, in many state matters.

There's another reason why I thought to mention Larry. He currently 
represents Sunset Energy Fleet, a company managed by Jerry Montrose, which is 
negotiating to win state permits for barge-mounted generation off of Brooklyn 
as well as gas supply contracts. He knows exactly what the power industry 
faces in New York.

If anyone would like to contact him, I'll forward that person's name to him. 
I'll give you his telephone number, too --

Below are a list of economists that we may want to consider for the Management Conference.  You may have thoughts or insights on one or more of them.  I've looked into Robert Rubins, but he is not accepting speaking engagements at the present time.  Of those listed below, I like Todd Buchholz, William Freund, Ron Insana and Paul Volcker.

Todd Buchholz -$12,000 West Coast/$15,000 East Coast plus first class expenses for 1 from Washington, D.C.
A leading expert on global economic trends, Todd Buchholz shows audiences how to thrive in a challenging economy, and how to gear up for future prosperity. As a former director of economic policy at the White House, a managing director of the Tiger hedge fund, and as an award-winning economics teacher at Harvard, Buchholz targets his entertaining remarks to the cutting edge of economics, finance, and business strategy.

Rick:  Per your request, please find the one page description of how the 
Washington D.C. office prioritizes both human and financial resources while 
fitting within the Enron budget process.   I have attached our 1999 
activities report which illustrates the process described below.  

Congress operates in a two year cycle while the Administration operates in a 
four or eight year cycle.  Thus, it is necessary for our prioritization to 
focus on the long term.  Within the context of the Congressional and 
Administration's Calendars, our office determines and communicates doable 
priorities based upon the environment in which we operate.  In addition, we 
actively work behind the scenes and commit resources to affect and change 
this environment.

 On an annual basis, we communicate federal legislative and global 
opportunities which we believe affect our operations via briefings to Steve 
Kean, who along with our assistance, submits our proposed goals to the Enron 
Management Committee,  Global CEO's , individual operating company heads and 
heads of key divisions.  Many dialogues and briefings occur resulting in goal 
adjustments and additions.  During this dialogue, we advise on possible new 
corporate strategies based upon political realities and communicate necessary 
resources required in order to achieve the legislative successes.  

Once this vetting process is complete (December-January timeframe), and the 
Management Committee prioritizes the federal Corporate goals, we submit our 
budget and assure this budget directly correlates to the necessary resources 
(both human and financial) detailed and allocated to meet these priorities.  
(Note:  the budget process usually occurs in the August-October timeframe).  
On the financial side, we keep current as to the rates and the expertise 
available on the market, as well as, track potential conflicts of interest.   
It's our job to know our environment and to lay out strategy.  On an annual 
basis, we adjust our resources which can include dropping some issues, 
reassigning personnel, hiring or letting go necessary outside counsel, etc.  

We remain mindful that in order to achieve legislative success, it is 
necessary to follow long-term planning so as to allow for us to build 
credibility, keep important political relationships viable and, ultimately, 
place us in the best possible political position to achieve success. 

Our budget does its best to recognize that the Congressional process can be 
unpredictable and that Congress reacts to fast occurring events and public 
reaction.   It is rare when we have not foreseen some form of a potential 
issue; thus, we always operate within budget.  An example of a contingency 
issue would be India setting off a nuclear device, a possibility we had 
accounted for yet could not possibly exactly predict nor could we predict the 
fall-out and precise Corporate impact.  However,we were still able to budget 
for possible permutations for such an occurrence and make adjustments as 
needed in order to meet our goals and stay within our budget.  Based upon the 
experience of the people in our office, we have been very successful in 
anticipating these type of occurrences.

Our report details our 1999 results and projects Enron priorities for 2000 
although neither the President's State of the Union address which outlines 
the Executive Branch's legislative agenda for 2000 nor the Republican 
Congressional response and 2000 Congressional legislative agenda has as of 
yet been delivered nor finalized.

1912,"Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when Davis will call back the California legislature to address the Edison MOU, here's the latest information we have.
Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.
Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week.
We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.
It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.
At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11.
In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.

We'll report back with information as we get it.

Best,

Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season.   ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.  </FONT>

""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.   </FONT>

According to the <I>

, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.</FONT>

The Rams' defense won't be able to stop the Tampa Bay offense from gaining yards this week so Gramatica will get a lot of opportunities to score, whether it's a field goal attempt or a point after. Expect him to make good on his opportunities. He is currently the hottest kicker in the NFL having made 19 of his last 20 attempts. Gramatica's hot streak was good enough to earn him a selection to this season's Pro Bowl team. Look for him to turn in another Pro Bowl-caliber performance against the Rams Monday and score a lot of Fantasy points for your squad. <BR>

Please find the attached update of all potential transactions and relevant P&L associated with Upstream Products/ BHLP.  If you have any questions, please contact me at work (x31931) or on my mobile  (713-302-4187).  

Quick updates by group :

Storage - We have been working a great deal with Regulatory affairs to assess and get over the regulatory risk associated with the monetization structure.  We (Steffes / myself) are having a conference call with Skadden Arps this coming Monday.  (Skadden Arps was the firm that wrote the opinion letter to Northern indemifying the pipeline of regulatory risk from the monetization of their pad gas.)  If you wish, I have a presentation delivered to Skadden regarding our proposed structure that I could forward to you.
Compression - Getting prices is still an issue.  Aucoin and et. al, have moved to six and we have dedicated a resource (John Kiani - who rotated through EES underwriting and understands EES' batch models) to help facilitate pricing.  Upstream Products has received most of the origination expected from Phase I, Formosa.  I left a voice message (in addition to the prior emails) with Goodpasture to negotiate origination between ECF and ENA for the storage deal Hilgert/Bilberry negotiated on their behalf.
Wellhead desk - is moving to 32, next to natural gas structuring, in order to be closer to logistics and have recorded phone lines for OTC transactions.  There have been many issues with our internal systems as well as logistics that are too numerous too mention.  Let us suffice to say, it has been a long two weeks.
Ecommerce - I think that the Andex VPP and outsourcing deal will close next week.  I have proposed a pricing structure to Phil Ballard and hopefully, Thompson will concur.  He is on vacation, but Ballard thought it was very reasonable.
Production Offshore - I am working with Tom to dismantle the group and associated responsibilities.

        told me that you were already there. I was going to try to set up a
        meeting with our CEO. We decided that I was too late and,
        therefore, should introduce myself via email. Amdahl is a US
        subsidiary of Fujitsu. Amdahl has been working with EBS at a lower
        level on the Blockbuster partnership and the Portland to Houston
        data center migration. We have determined that there are many
        synergies between the two companies on a global basis.

Fujitsu is the second largest IT company in the world and Japan's largest
        computer manufacturer. In terms of US dollars, Fujitsu is about $52
        billion. Here is a web site if you are interested.

          http://www.fujitsu.com/

Fujitsu is a large consumer of electricity and broadband. I would like to get 
the executives of the two companies talking.
      I think there are major opportunities for Enron to sell ""stuff"" to 
Fujitsu, for Fujitsu to sell ""stuff"" to Enron, and to jointly
     develop   products.

At your convenience, I would like to come by and introduce myself and see if 
you agree that we should have the two
     companies open discussions. I understand that you will be in Houston on 
Monday. I will try you then.

Kenneth L. Lay is the chairman and CEO of Enron, based in Houston, Texas.
Enron, one of the largest integrated natural gas and electricity companies
in the world, operates one of the world's largest natural gas transmission
systems and is the world's largest supplier of electricity and natural gas
in North America. Under Lay's leadership, the company has grown to $31
billion in annual revenues. For the past four years, Fortune magazine has
named Enron the most innovative company in America.

Lay, a Missouri native, earned bachelor's and master's degrees from MU in
1964 and 1965, respectively, garnering Phi Beta Kappa distinction as an
undergraduate. He completed a PhD degree in economics from the University of
Houston in 1970.

After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, Lay joined Pinkney Walker as
his technical assistant in Washington, D.C., in the early 1970s. At that
time, Walker had just been appointed a commissioner of the Federal Power
Commission. Lay later served as deputy undersecretary of the U.S. Department
of Interior.

Lay is a member of the President's Council on Sustainable Development, the
Business Council, the National Petroleum Council and the American Enterprise
Institute. He is a member of the board of trustees of the H. John Heinz III
Center for Science, Economics, and the Environment. He is also a director
for Compaq Computer Corp., Eli Lilly and Co., and Trust Company of the West.

Lay received the college's Alumni Citation of Merit in 1990 and an honorary
Doctor of Law degree from MU in 1992. He received the Private Sector
Council's 1997 Leadership Award, was inducted into the Texas Business Hall
of Fame in 1997, and was presented a Horatio Alger Award in 1998.

AMCC First to Enable the Next Generation Multi-Carrier, Transparent
Network Architecture With Introduction of 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper and FEC
Device=0F=3DAMCC's Hudson is the Industry's First Device to Meet the Rapidl=
y=20
Growing
Demand for 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper Solutions From the Man, Transport and WD=
M
Sectors

SAN DIEGO, Dec 11, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AM=
CC)
(Nasdaq:AMCC), a leader in high-bandwidth silicon connectivity solutions fo=
r=20
the
world's optical networks, today announced the Hudson (S19203), the industry=
's
first 10 Gbps silicon device architected to support both the evolving G.709
digital wrapper standard and traditional SONET/SDH infrastructures.

The Hudson variable rate, digital wrapper framer/deframer and performance
monitor device facilitates the transparent transport of multiple protocols
across the network, while aiding interconnection between multiple carriers.
Hudson incorporates programmable Forward Error Correction (FEC) for rates u=
p=20
to
10.66 Gbps and supports OC-192 transmission standards. The digital wrapper
technology provides an extension of the current SONET/SDH infrastructure,=
=20
while
enhancing both flexibility and transparency across the network. The Hudson
easily interfaces with AMCC's 10 Gbps mux/demux devices, SONET/SDH/digital
wrapper backplane devices and AMCC's mapping and pointer processing devices=
.

""The digital wrapper is the next important step for large optical networks =
as=20
it
incorporates the best features of SONET/SDH while removing some of the rigi=
d
overhead structure that makes SONET/SDH sub-optimal for an IP-centric,
intelligent optical network,"" said Brent Little, vice president of marketin=
g=20
for
AMCC. ""By using key devices such as Hudson, OEMs will now be able to create=
=20
more
efficient and interoperable systems without starting from scratch.""

AMCC's digital wrapper design has already been adopted by most of the major=
=20
wide
area networking (WAN) equipment manufacturers. The demand for digital wrapp=
er
products stems from the need in the WAN to transparently transport multiple
protocols at 10 Gbps, coupled with the need to efficiently provision bandwi=
dth
across today's multiple-carrier network.

""The Hudson is built for the next-generation multi-carrier transport networ=
k
architecture and ushers in an efficient and cost-effective means of=20
transporting
traffic while extending existing SONET infrastructures,"" said Ken Prentiss,
AMCC's director of marketing for telecom products. ""We are seeing=20
unprecedented
demand for Hudson across a large customer base due mainly to the device's
flexible architecture; customers can wrap, unwrap or monitor traditional
SONET/SDH traffic, or wrap and unwrap IP or any other traffic using a singl=
e
device.""

The digital wrapper concept involves grouping together a number of existing
frames into ""super-frames,"" which can then be more efficiently managed with=
 a
relatively small allocation of overhead-per-byte of data. By aggregating
together the provisions for ""framing bits"" that are already defined for use=
 by
existing time-division multiplexed (TDM) structures, the super-frame concep=
t
allows for the implementation of an intelligent operation, administration a=
nd
maintenance (OAM) capability without materially expanding the amount of dat=
a
currently being transmitted. This creative use of available control bits al=
so
allows FEC functions to be very efficiently incorporated within the digital
wrapper definition without a significant net increase in overall bandwidth
usage.

The Hudson's core logic runs on a 1.8V power supply and features two input =
and
two output ports, which are configurable in many ways. Figure 1 shows a=20
typical
network application supporting a single data stream with dual redundant inp=
ut
and output lines. The input and output ports can be configured as a dual
redundant I/O on a single data stream for protection switching or as two
completely independent data streams for duplex operation. Either input port=
=20
can
be directly connected to either output port for loopback testing.

The Hudson provides full digital wrapper performance monitoring and feature=
s
Optical Channel Overhead (OCh-OH) insertion and extraction, which are
independently controllable. All 64 OCh-OH bytes in a superframe are=20
programmable
in function and are available for insertion from and drop to FPGA or
microprocessor. Data entering and leaving the Hudson device can be optional=
ly
differentially decoded and encoded, deframed and framed, descrambled and
scrambled, and decoded and encoded with FEC information. In addition, SONET=
=20
data
can optionally be performance monitored for integrity, alarms, and trace
messages.

_____________________________________________________________________

The STOCK INDEXES The Nasdaq and S&P's extended last week's short
covering rally on ideas that all of the bad news about earnings has
been discounted into the markets. Additional support came from ideas
that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2001. The Nasdaq
spiked above this fall's downtrend line crossing near 2950 on Monday.
Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to confirm a
breakout and trend change has taken place. Meanwhile, the rally in
tech stocks helped pull the broader market higher on the day. Closes
above last week's high crossing at 10,917.30 would open the door for
a possible test of last spring's high crossing at 11,425.40.

INTEREST RATES March bonds posted a inside day with a lower close as
it consolidated some of last week's gains. Light pressure came from
today's rebound in the equity markets. Stochastics and RSI are
bullish but becoming overbought warning traders that a short- term
top may be in or near. Closes below November's uptrend line crossing
near 102-24 would signal a top and trend change has taken place.

CRB INDEX closed higher on Monday led by gains in energies, some
foods, and fiber. The CRB continues to consolidate below this fall's
high of 234.38. Closes above this resistance level or below the
late-November reaction low crossing at 228.04 are needed to clear up
near-term direction.

ENERGIES The energy markets closed higher on Monday due to short
covering as Iraqi crude oil exports remain halted for the 11th day
and natural gas prices surged due to cold weather moving across the
United States. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold
hinting a short-term bottom in January crude oil and the products may
be near. Closes above last Thursday's highs in any or all of the
complex would strongly suggest a low has been posted.

CURRENCIES the March Dollar extended its short covering bounce off
last Thursday's low and closed above broken trendline support
crossing near 114. Closes below last week's low at 112.64 are needed
to confirm the recent trendline breakout. However, momentum
indicators have become oversold hinting a short covering bounce is
possible before this fall's decline continues. The March Swiss Franc
and D-mark closed lower on Monday as profit taking from last week's
continues. The overbought condition of a number of momentum
indicators that hints further setbacks is possible before the
corrections are over. The March Japanese Yen posted an inside day
with a higher close due to light short covering as it extends the
current trading range. Momentum indicators have turned bullish
signaling sideways to higher prices near-term are possible. Closes
above .9279 or below .9088 are needed to clear up near-term direction
in the market.

PRECIOUS METALS were closed mixed on Monday. February gold extended
its setback off last Thursday's high due to the rebound in the U.S.
Dollar and in doing so turned a number of momentum indicators neutral
to bearish. Closes below November's uptrend line crossing near 271.80
would confirm the rally off October's low has likely come to an end.
March silver posted an inside day with a higher close due to light
short covering as it consolidated some of last Friday's losses. While
another day or two of consolidation is possible, the door is open for
a test of November's low at 4.69 cents later this month. March copper
closed higher on Monday but near session lows due to profit taking
ahead of the close. Today's spike of the 62% retracement level
crossing at .8947 followed by the low-range close is a warning to
bulls that a short-term top may be in or near. Closes below last
Friday's low crossing at 87.55 would likely turn a number of momentum
indicators bearish and increase the odds that a short- term top has
been posted.

GRAINS closed lower on Monday. March corn posted another inside day
with a lower close as traders squared positions ahead of Tuesday's
supply and demand reports. Additional pressure came from news that
China sold around 1 million tons of corn on Friday. Expectations for
additional sales by China later this week added to the bearish tone.
Traders are looking for the USDA to lower their export projections by
50-100 million bushels in tomorrow's reports. Today's export
inspection report came in at a disappointing 28.394 million bushels
verse 39.660 million bushels last week. March wheat also closed lower
on Monday due to spillover weakness from corn. Traders were reluctant
to buy wheat on chances that some of the hard winter wheat crop may
experience winterkill due to the winter storm rolling across the
plains. Traders are expecting to see the USDA lower its export
projection by some 25-million bushels due to this fall's slow export
pace. March wheat is challenging the lower boundary of this fall's
trading range at 2.69. If this support gives way, 2.63 1/2 then 2.50
are potential targets later this winter.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed mixed on Monday. January beans closed
fractionally higher on Monday due to light position squaring ahead of
tomorrow's supply and demand reports. The trade is looking for a
25-35 million bushels increase in the USDA export projection due to
this fall's strong export sales. Multiple closes above fib resistance
crossing at 5.10 3/4 would open the door for a possible test of this
fall's high at 5.25 later this winter. January soybean meal closed
higher on Monday thereby confirming last Friday's upside reversal.
Expectations for continued strong export demand through this winter
in both the Asian and European markets will continue to underpin the
meal market. Closes above the late- November high crossing at 193.50
would renew November's rally and set the stage for a test of weekly
resistance crossing at 202.50 later this month. January bean oil
posted an inside day with a lower close on Monday as it extends last
week's consolidation pattern. At the same time, momentum indicators
are bearish signaling sideways to lower prices near-term are
possible. A neutral to bearish supply and demand report on Tuesday
may provide the catalyst needed to renew the decline off last week's
high. The stage appears to be set for a test of the late-November low
at 14.64 later this month.

LIVESTOCK closed mixed on Monday. February hogs closed slightly
higher on Monday but near session lows as profit taking ahead of the
close erased early strength tied to weather concerns. Momentum
indicators are bullish but diverging warning traders that a broad
double top may be forming. Closes below last Friday's reaction low
along with a downturn by stochastics would increase the odds a top
has been posted. February cattle posted an inside day with a lower
close as it consolidated some of last week's gains. News that the
heaviest snowfall stayed away from cattle-feeding areas limited gains
in the market, which fell ahead of the close due to light profit
taking. At the same time, cold weather is expected to slow gains,
which will help underpin the market. Momentum indicators are bullish
hinting a test of long-term resistance crossing near 77.92 is still
possible later this month.

FOOD & FIBER markets were mixed on Monday. March coffee posted an
inside day with a lower close on Monday as it consolidated some of
last Friday's losses. However, today's low-range close signals
additional weakness is possible later this week. If the decline
continues, the August 1993 low crossing at 66.25 is March's next
target. March cocoa closed lower on Monday signaling the two-day
bounce off last Wednesday's low has come to an end. Today's loss
turned a number of momentum indicators neutral to bearish signaling a
test of November's low at 713 is possible. Closes below this support
level would open the door for a test of psychological support
crossing at 700 later this winter. March sugar posted a downside
reversal on Monday due to a lack of cash buying. March continues to
consolidate above minor support crossing at 950. However, momentum
indicators remain bearish signaling sideways to lower prices into the
end of the year are possible. March cotton posted an inside day with

Microsoft Rolls On, and Over, the Media

Hear that whacking? It's the sound of Microsoft snipping back its
marketing budget. With press clips like Redmond's been getting, why
spend the money?

Microsoft's stock is up 60 percent this year, and the software giant
plans to roll out a string of new products, making Bill Gates a popular
cover boy for Fortune and Business Week. The only thing missing
from their reviews of his company's elaborate plans is scrutiny.

""Just about any software application on your PC and even on your cell
phone or PDA will tap directly into interactive services to make work
and life easier to manage,"" Fortune enthused, pointing out without the
slightest hint of irony that since there's no business model for the
subscription software services that Microsoft is drooling over,
Redmond will simply have to invent one.

FOUR STEPS TO HIGH PROFITS WITH VIRTUALLY NO RISK

UNCANNY 99.39% Accuracy and $730,566.72 Profits
. . . a Revolutionary Profit Miracle!

Andrew

Introducing - THE SCIENCE OF AUTOMATIC OPTION PROFITS

This shocking book reveals the most accurate and profitable
trading strategies I have ever seen - anywhere. With 491
wins out of 494 trades since May 1995, this is a virtual
sure-thing-profit secret!

In fact, in over 26 years in futures and options, I have
never seen a trading system that came so close to virtually
guaranteeing profits, trade - after - trade.

Win on at least 9 out of every 10 Trades
- Absolutely Guaranteed!

Now I've seen hundreds of trading systems claiming huge
profits - and most just self-destruct when put to the test.
That's why I immediately began following this
strategy...way back when I first learned of it.

The results blew me away! Every trade - every last one -
has been profitable since. Take a look for yourself.

The phenomenal record was no pipe dream. Trade after trade,
it has proven to be the trading system of a lifetime.

LIVESTOCK: December live cattle closed up $0.65 at $67.95 today. The
big rally in the hogs supported the cattle futures today, as did
short covering. Prices scored a mildly bullish ""outside day"" up on
the daily bar chart today--whereby the high was higher and the low
was lower than the previous session's trading range, with a higher
close.

December lean hogs closed up $1.80 today at $49.65. A bullish monthly
USDA hogs and pigs report Friday-- showing a smaller pig crop than
last year--boosted futures sharply higher today. Ideas this week's
kill will be less than last week's also lent strength to futures
prices today.

GRAINS: December corn futures closed 2 cents lower at $2.03 1/2
today. Prices dropped to a fresh contract low today on fund selling.
The market feels pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. After
today's decline, I don't think there's much downside left in corn.

January soybeans closed unchanged at $4.34 1/4 today. More solid
export demand, in the form of strong weekly export inspections data
today, failed to push the market higher. While prices could retest
the contract lows scored last week, or even drop below them, I do
think the downside from present price levels is limited.

December Chicago SRW wheat closed off 3 3/4 cents at $2.91 1/4 today.
Prices backed off today on some profit

taking from the recent gains, and no chart damage was done today.
Prices Friday hit a fresh three-month high.

SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 5 points higher at 6.77 cents today.
Prices closed near the session high. A fledging three-week-old
uptrend line is still intact on the daily bar chart--but just barely.
Bears still have the technical edge, overall.

December N.Y. coffee closed 25 points higher at 43.65 cents today.
Not much fresh news. The bears are in full command of coffee at
present. The only encouraging news to the bulls is the recent
increase in volatility at these lower price levels.

December N.Y. cocoa closed $2 higher today, at $997. There was enough
follow-through buying today to confirm a bullish key reversal on the
daily bar chart.

December cotton closed 8 points higher at 28.94 cents in

quiet trading today. Prices last week dropped down below key
long-term support at 29.50 cents. This opens the door to declines to
the 26-cent area, which is the lows seen in 1972, basis nearby
futures.

January orange juice on Friday afternoon closed at 90.65. That's up
155 points from the Thursday evening close. Prices gapped higher
Friday and bulls still have the big edge.

METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed up $1.40 at $279.70 an
ounce today. The weaker U.S. dollar helped the yellow metal today.
Prices are still seeing a corrective bounce in a bear market, but
bulls will take what they can get at present.

December silver futures closed $0.028 higher at $4.243 an ounce
today. Prices hit a fresh five-week low last week and bears have the
big edge.

December N.Y. copper closed 40 points lower at 63.10 cents. Prices
last week dropped to a contract low of 62.00 cents. Bears rule.

ENERGIES: December crude closed $0.10 higher at $22.15 today. It was
a fairly quiet day. The daily chart still looks bearish. However, the
longer the market trades sideways, the more that favors the bulls and
some ""basing"" activity.

December heating oil closed 33 points higher at .6337 today. It was a
quiet day today. The daily chart still looks bearish as prices hover
not that far above the recent lows.

December unleaded gasoline closed 8 points lower at .5873 today.
Prices scored a mildly bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar
chart today. The daily chart still looks

bearish.

December natural gas closed $0.177 higher at $3.36 today.

Prices scored a fresh seven-week high today. Prices last

week pushed up above a longer-term downtrend line on the daily bar
chart and today it was negated.

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 125
points higher today at .9018. Bulls needed a day like today after the
bears knocked them around recently. Bears remain in control.

The December Japanese yen closed up 52 points at .8218 today. Today
saw a rebound in a bear market and bears rule. Prices pushed to a
three-month low last week.

The December Swiss franc closed 91 points higher at .6134 today.
Bulls needed today after their recent whipping. A steep five-week-old
downtrend line on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the upside
and negated today.

The December Canadian dollar closed 13 points higher at

.6351 today. Bears still rule as prices are in a four-month-old
downtrend on the daily bar chart.

The December British pound closed up 164 points at 1.4486 today.
Today's big gains negated a three-week-old downtrend line on the
daily bar chart and puts the bulls and bears back on a level playing
field, overall.

The September U.S. dollar index closed 119 points lower at

114.71 today. Prices gapped lower on the daily bar chart today and
they closed near the session low. Technical damage was done with
today's big downmove.

December U.S. T-bonds closed 10/32 higher at 108 1/32. The

bulls continue their push north as a new for-the-move

high was set today. Prices are at lofty levels, but there is nothing
on the daily chart that suggests prices cannot go farther north.

December S&P 500 futures closed off 28.50 at 1,073.50. Prices closed
near the session low today as trading has turned sideways and
choppier. Poor earnings reports, a weaker economic picture and an
increasing anthrax scare will limit upside moves.

***If you would like more information please email  me.
 

 
Emini  Daytrader (The Advisor) - Emini & S&P 500 Daytrading - Went  Long at 1280, The 4 point target was narrowly missed so the stop was moved just  below the entry.  Trade exited at the trailing stop  
-1.5 per contract.
 
**The market continued to trade within a narrow range,  which is typical on he days when the contracts ""roll"" .  Front month  in the S&P 500, DJ 100, Nasdaq 100. etc.  is NOW the September contract  (Symbol ""U"").  Days like today can be tough trading days especially if  there is not significant buying or selling in the market.  The MAY Chain  Store sales came out at 9:00 CST today and I acyually expected the market to  rally off of the number, but many of the retailers reported less than expected  sales.  The indication I got was that consumers are still spending money  despite a slow down in manufacturing and higher energy prices.  Walmart was  among retailers reporting LOWER sales figures.

Answers Elusive For Ask Jeeves

By Chris Nerney
Senior Analyst

In May 1999, he predicted the company would be profitable within 24
months.

With only five months to go, it now looks like Ask Jeeves is falling
somewhat short of CEO Robert Wrubel's bold proclamation.

But Wrubel won't be at the helm when next May arrives, for he is stepping
down from the chief executive's post and relinquishing his seat on the
board of directors. Many current Ask Jeeves employees also may find
themselves in other jobs come May, as heavy layoffs loom for the
red-drenched ""natural language"" search portal and technology company.

None of which should be surprising to anyone looking beyond the prodigious
hype that has accompanied the marketing-savvy firm for most of its brief
existence.

Among those ignoring the warning signs for too long were the half-dozen or
so analysts who rushed to downgrade ASKJ shares late last week after the
company warned that fourth-quarter losses, already expected to be bad (33
cents per share), would be even worse (50 cents per share). Some had cut
their ratings for Ask Jeeves earlier in the year (though not enough),
while at least a couple - First Union and US Bancorp Piper Jaffray - each
had rated ASKJ a ""strong buy"" by late July.

I won't have to lower my assessment of Ask Jeeves, because I've always
been skeptical about the company's business model, technology claims and
long-term prospects, even before its July '99 ticker debut.

Since its moonshot IPO, Ask Jeeves has consistently turned in quarterly
reports showing deep operating losses and revenues that failed to justify
the company's previously lofty valuation. Shares reached absurd heights a
year ago (closing at $186 on Nov. 16, 1999) and have been unraveling ever
since. After Thursday's Q4 warning, ASKJ plunged 66% to $3.25 by early
Friday afternoon, a price that leaves the stock with a 97% loss for the
year. Put that in the Macy's Day parade and see if it floats.

The company insists it can make a profit by Q4 2001, or a year from now.
Given the Q4 preview, that's a tall order. First, softness in spending on
online advertising is expected to continue through the first two quarters
next year, and perhaps beyond. In fact, fourth-quarter sales are forecast
to be about $25 million, less than the previous two quarters. So Ask
Jeeves may have trouble increasing revenues, even as it tries to move
further away from dependence on ad dollars and toward business services.

Net loss for Q4 is expected to be $18 million, or 50 cents per share,
which may be worse than street estimates, but still is a big improvement
over Q3's net loss of $39 million, or $1.08 per share. If a company's
revenues are flat and it's losing money, there's only one way to erase the
operating deficit: Cut costs. That might be accomplished in part through
increased efficiencies. However, the traditional and surer method is an
employee blood-letting.

That's what Ask Jeeves will be looking forward to next year - if it's
lucky. If it's not...well, we all know the answer to that one.

2043,"Sunday evening, December 10, 2000

COMMENT: On December 5, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan spoke. He said that the
""wealth effect"" has been ""significantly attenuated"" thanks to the drop in
stock prices. He also acknowledges that our economy ""is obviously at
increased risk of untoward events.."" He is right, of course, and in a
position to reduce this risk by easing monetary policy. Ironically, his
latest speech follows by exactly four years the one in which the Fed
Chairman famously asked, "".how do we know when irrational exuberance has
unduly escalated asset values.""

More and more these days, I hear from various well-connected business
sources that sales ""fell off a cliff"" since the summer. This is confirmed by
the steep drop in consumer confidence during the first half of December and
Intel's warning last week about sudden order cancellations. Despite this
warning, large/mid/small cap tech stocks were up last week by 8.1%, 15.2%,
and 9.9%, respectively. Could it be that the bad news is mostly in stocks
and that the market is starting to anticipate Fed easing soon? I think so.

SUBSCRIBERS: The risk is that Fed easing might not work to avert a recession
this time. This ""pushing-on-a-string"" fear was frequently raised by Asian
investors, who I met last week in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Many of
my friends in Japan see lots of disturbing parallels in the US today with
their unhappy economic and financial experience during the previous decade.
I reminded them that there are still 650 basis points left between the
federal funds rate and zero. For more on this subject, see my latest GLOBAL
PORTFOLIO STRATEGY. The topic for Monday's WEEKLY AUDIO FORUM: ""Will US
follow Japan's bubble script?""

PUBLIC: You can decide for yourself whether it is too late for Fed officials
to avert a recession, and how quickly they can get us out once they start to
ease by tracking numerous KEY WEEKLY indicators on the HOME page. You'll
find initial jobless claims, bank credit, mortgage applications, and more.
In his latest speech, the Fed Chairman said he still believes that the
secular rebound in productivity growth is intact. I agree. You can find his
speech in the GREENSPAN CENTER and our updated (Dec 6) PRODUCTIVITY TRENDS
chart book on the WHAT'S NEW page.

I can't pass up this opportunity to share my all-time favorite SB Bove award. 
It involved a brother who, having led a pampered life at home, had never done 
his own laundry. He decided the time had come to do his own laundry. Sometime 
later, after having deposited the proper coinage and starting the machine, he 
returned to check on his laundry. He was found standing at the DRYER 
bewildered as to why his powdered laundry detergent had not dissolved and his 
clothes were still dry.

just now digging through my email stack.

I assume the question concerns the big chunk of metal that has a steel bar
pressed into an aluminum base and a slanted steel plate on top.  Tom Murray
helped me build it.  We are both class of '79 and I believe we built it in
'78 or '79.  We put it together in the old Washburn machine shops were I
was working as an assistant.  The idea of the steel plate was to put the
brothers name once each week when it was passed around.  Dave M. has a much
better recollection of how it was introduced than I do so I will let his
version of the events stand.

For the history of the award and how it all started you will have to ask
someone else.

One of these years I'll get back for a reunion but I've been living in
Switzerland for the last 10 years and with a family it's not so easy to get
over very often.  Noone sings ""Home on the range"" anymore but I do enjoy
the yodelling and Swiss alphorns.  I actually don't feel that far away from
the USA.  I can get TexMex to eat right around the corner from the office.
The night of the election one of the main Swiss television stations had an
all night broadcast  and people are always asking me who is going to win.
I sometimes think the Swiss are talking about the election as much as the
Americans.  The more sensible ones understand what's happening.  In any
case my kids (10 and 12) are very interested and it gives me a chance to
explain how the system works (or doesn't depending on your viewpoint).  By
the way, when is someone going to come over for a visit ?

SPECIAL ELECTION CONFERENCE CALL: On Friday, Nov. 10, Mark Melcher, an
independent political analyst, and I discussed the likely consequences of
the Presidential election mess. You can listen to the rebroadcast at
www.yardeni.com/waf.asp.

DEUTSCHE BANC ALEX. BROWN'S TECH 2000 CONFERENCE: Watch this premier annual
tech conference live from Nov. 13-16. I will speak on the outlook for the
tech industry on Tuesday, Nov. 14 at 11:30 am (est). Register now at
www.webevents.broadcast.com/db/techconf1100/frameset.html.

COMMENT: In the latest Congressional elections, the Republicans still held
on to their majorities in the Senate and the House, but barely. Whoever is
the next President has no mandate whatsoever. The voters in their collective
wisdom have given us the most gridlocked political system in our nation's
history. This suggests that the country is evenly and hopelessly split into
two factions with very different agendas. Or else, the country is mostly
satisfied and prefers to veto both the Gore and the Bush agendas. I think
the latter is a more accurate interpretation of the Presidential and
Congressional votes. Obviously, this political stalemate could be a
decidedly bearish outcome, especially if the legitimacy of the new president
is questioned. More likely, the new president and Congress will seek out
common ground for bipartisan legislative initiatives. The stock market may
remain on the defensive until this outcome is clearer. In any event, extreme
policy changes are now almost certainly extremely unlikely. This should
ultimately be bullish for both bonds and stocks.

SUBSCRIBERS: For more of my thoughts on the election, see my latest GLOBAL
PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, which also includes my outlook for profits in 2000. The
latest EARNINGS WEEK reviews the significant drop in consensus earnings
expectations.

EXCERPT (Nov. 6 GPS): ""Last week, I had the opportunity to speak at a
conference in Santa Clara, California on the impact of new technologies on
the real estate industry. While I was in Silicon Valley, I also stopped by
the Deutsche Bank office in Menlo Park. It is located on Sand Hill Road, the
West Coast's Wall Street for high-tech startups. The well-manicured road is
lined with the offices of venture capitalists (VCs). I am happy to report
that while the tech wreck in the stock market may have wiped out most
dot-coms, their financiers are alive and well. They are regrouping and
working hard to find and incubate the next New New Thing.

The VC phenomenon is a vital and unique aspect of the New Economy. The New
Economy is driven by a New Paradigm. The New Paradigm is actually a very old
paradigm called Competition. The most important characteristic of a
competitive market is that there are no barriers to entry. One of the
greatest barriers to entry is the availability of financing. The VCs have
virtually eliminated this barrier in the technology industry.

Of course, the Sand Hill Gang went too far over the past year. Money was too
easily available for any startup with a dot-com included in the company's
name. Early in their studies, economists are taught that in competitive
markets, marginal cost equals marginal revenue. The VCs gave away too much
money to too many harebrained entrepreneurs, and the result was probably
close to a zero marginal return averaging the many small losers with the few
really big winners.

The willingness of VCs and their limited partners to take on enormous risk
to finance entrepreneurs with untested ideas and innovations is a great
source of the New Economy's creativity, strength, and productivity. In the
past, entrepreneurs were stymied by the unwillingness of bankers to take a
chance on them. In the 1980s, Michael Milken revolutionized this process by
raising money for entrepreneurs directly in the capital markets. He invented
the concept of issuing high-yield bonds as an alternative to bank financing.
The VCs have taken this concept to the next level. Instead of entrepreneurs
searching for financing, the VCs are searching for entrepreneurs to finance.

Many of the VCs are relatively young, in their 20s and 30s. So are many of
the portfolio managers of the technology mutual funds. Just for fun, I often
ask these folks if they know what VC once meant before venture capitalists.
Most of them are stumped. During the bad old days during the war in Vietnam,
it stood for Viet Cong.

Today's VCs are also well trained in the art of the ambush. They are
constantly on the hunt for new-new companies that can put old new-new
companies out of business. They are today's financiers of the process of
""creative destruction,"" which was brilliantly explained by Joseph
Schumpeter. This means that no business is safe from competition. Indeed,
the most successful and most profitable businesses are the ones that are
most at risk from a deluge of VC money financing wanna-be competitors.

The bottom line is that technology will continue to be the most innovative
and the most
competitive industry, with great rewards and great risk.""

TOP GROKS

Economists: Relax, This Won't Hurt a Bit

Most of us like recession speculation about as much as we like tetanus
shots. A business forecast from UCLA brought out the big needle on
Monday and predicted a 60 percent chance of the r-word in 2001. Like
your doctor, the UCLA economists said it would only pinch a little,
and then it would all be over.

CBS MarketWatch, Newsbytes and MSNBC provided good summaries of the
report, which insisted everything would be peachy again in 2002.
Newsbytes' Michael Bartlett led with some encouragement for deflated
techie egos: ""The stimulus of the Internet-led 'New Economy' was
enough to keep the current economic expansion in the United States
driving forward for four years longer than it might have,"" he said,
paraphrasing the report. Funny how everyone's putting ""new economy"" in
quotes these days - it used to seem so real.

The San Jose Mercury News called the predicted downturn ""recession
lite"" and noted that local California readers ""will escape the worst
of it."" (A separate UCLA report on California put the odds of a
statewide recession at 40 percent; report author Tom Lieser prefers
the term ""deceleration."") Many experts expect 3 percent growth next
year, so the Merc's Jennifer Bjorhus called other economist to compare
notes. One Bay Area econ professor agreed that we may be in trouble,
but the UCLA report ""has other economists scratching their heads,""
said Bjorhus. ""I don't know of anybody else that's out there that
far,"" said economist Richard Carlson.

We do. CBS MarketWatch columnist Paul Farrell wondered if the slump
has already arrived, citing Ken Kurson's article ""Nine Signs We're
Already in a Recession"" in Esquire's December issue. Kurson's thesis
made sense and ""was worth the price of the magazine,"" but in the end,
Farrell shrugged it off. ""Neither Esquire's Grinch nor the U.S.
Supreme Court is going to steal my Christmas,"" he wrote. If only we
could face the doctor with such self-assurance. - Jen Muehlbauer

_____________________________________________________________________

The STOCK INDEXES The Nasdaq and S&P's closed lower on Wednesday as
chip and hardware stocks fell due to concerns over corporate profits.
Salomon Smith Barney lowered its rating on the chip equipment group,
citing a capital-spending freeze of up to six months at Intel. The
Dow closed higher on Wednesday due in part to strength in Philip
Morris, J.P. Morgan and Johnson & Johnson. Early strength tested last
week's high crossing at 10,917.30, which marks short-term resistance.
Multiple closes above this resistance level would open the door for a
possible year end rally that could lead to an eventual test of last
spring's high crossing at 11,425.40 later this winter.

INTEREST RATES March bonds gapped up and surged to a new contract
high thereby renewing this fall's rally. Weakness in the Nasdaq and
S&P's underpinned today's rally in bonds in part due to a safe-haven
move by some investors. Today's high-range close sets the stage for
sharply higher prices on Thursday should November's Producer Price
Index come in weaker than expected. If the rally in March bonds
continues, weekly resistance crossing at 106-10 is the next upside
objective later this winter.

CRB INDEX extended Tuesday's loss and confirmed a downside breakout
below the lower boundary of this month's symmetrical triangle and
filled November's gap at 227.58. Today's decline confirms the rally
off the late-October low has come to an end while marking a broad
double top on the daily chart. If the decline continues, fib support
crossing at 225.87 is the next downside target. Much of today's
pressure was due to weakness in precious metals, foods, fiber, and
energies.

ENERGIES The energy markets closed sharply lower on Wednesday due to
liquidation of Brent crude oil ahead of Thursday's January contract
expiration. The sell off was some what of a surprise following recent
industry data, which showed crude and heating oil stocks fell last
week and indications that Iraq has not fully resumed crude oil sales.
February crude oil posted a key reversal down today thereby ending
this week's short covering rebound. Additional weakness on Thursday
is needed to confirm today's reversal pattern. If this fall's decline
resumes, fib support crossing at 27.37 is the next target. February
heating oil also closed sharply lower on Wednesday and is challenging
key support crossing at 88.10. Multiple closes below this support
level could lead to a test of the 38% retracement level of the
1999/2000- advance crossing at 84.11 later this winter.

CURRENCIES the March Dollar closed higher on Wednesday as it renewed
its short covering rebound off last week's low. Today's rally was
underpinned by Tuesday's U.S. Supreme Court decision to halt the
manual recount thereby giving the election to George W. Bush.
Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling sideways to higher
prices into the end of the year are possible. Today's mid-range close
leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday. The March
Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on Wednesday as they extend their
declines off last week's highs. Momentum indicators have turned
bearish warning additional weakness into the end of the year is
possible. The March Japanese Yen plunged to a new contract low in
overnight trading and held onto those losses during the day session.
Concerns over the Japanese economy and the U.S. Supreme Court ruling
triggered the sell off. The door is open for a test of last
February's low crossing at .8978 then fib support crossing at .8774
later this winter.

PRECIOUS METALS were closed lower on Wednesday. February gold resumed
its decline off last week's high and closed below November's uptrend
line crossing near 271.80 thereby confirming a short-term top has
been posted. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling sideways to
lower prices into the end of the year are possible. Support begins at
266.80. March silver also closed lower on Wednesday ending this
week's short covering bounce. Today's new low close for the week and
test of support crossing at 4.69 sets the stage for additional
weakness into the end of the year. If the decline continues, weekly
support crossing at 4.56 cents is March's next target. March copper
extended Tuesday's loss in relatively narrow trading but pulled up
short of testing November's uptrend line crossing near 87.75. A short
covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses
leaving the door open for additional short covering on Thursday.
Nevertheless, momentum indicators are overbought and turning bearish
signaling additional weakness near-term is possible. Closes below
November's uptrend line would confirm a top and trend change has
taken place.

GRAINS closed mixed on Wednesday. March corn posted a key reversal up
Wednesday due to expectations that tomorrow's export sales report
will show a significant improvement from recent weeks. Confirmation
of improving export sales on Thursday could lead to further short
covering thereby turning a number of momentum indicators neutral to
bullish. Such a turnaround in the near-term price outlook could lead
to year-end rebound however, it will take closes above 2.22 1/4
before a low is confirmed. March wheat closed lower on Wednesday as
traders are struggling to find direction following Tuesday's key
reversal down in the face of a friendly supply and demand report.
Traders remain concerned over lagging export sales and expect to see
another week of slow export sales in Thursday's report. March is
challenging trading range support crossing at 2.69. If this support
level is broken, the fall low at 2.63 1/2 then long-term support at
2.50 are possible targets. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling
additional weakness is possible.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed mixed on Wednesday. March beans managed to
squeak out a fractional gain on Wednesday as it continues to
consolidate below the 75% retracement level of this fall's decline,
which crosses at 5.20. While Tuesday's supply and demand report was
friendly, the increase in export sales and drop in carryout was
already factored into prices. March beans are at a crossroads as a
lack of fresh news is limiting gains while solid demand continues to
underpin the market. Closes above 5.20 or below trendline support
crossing near 5.12 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the
market. March soybean meal closed slightly lower on Wednesday due to
light profit taking as it consolidated some of its recent gains.
March continues to extend the late-fall trading range despite
Tuesday's friendly supply and demand report. Closes above 189.50 or
below 182.30 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the
market. March bean oil posted an inside day with a slightly higher
close due to light short covering as it consolidated some of this
week's losses. However, today's low-range close leaves the door open
for a resumption of the decline off this month's high. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling a test of November's low crossing at
15.05 is possible later this winter.

LIVESTOCK closed steady on Wednesday. February hogs posted a quiet
inside day with a steady close as it consolidated some of Tuesday's
loss. However, momentum indicators are diverging and turning bearish
warning traders that a broad double top may have been posted with
Monday's spike high. A resumption of this week's decline on Thursday
would set the stage for a test of trendline support crossing near
57.50. If the late fall rally resumes, weekly resistance crossing at
63.30 is the next upside target. February cattle also closed steady
after early strength tied to winter storm concerns and expectations
for higher cash bids gave way to light profit taking ahead of the
close. Today's high fell short of testing weekly resistance crossing
at 77.92. Momentum indicators have become very overbought warning
traders that much of the bullish news from higher cash and product
prices underpinned by surprisingly strong demand may have already
been discounted in prices. Closes below Tuesday's low at 76.50 would
be a clear warning to bulls that a short-term top may be in or near.

FOOD & FIBER markets were mixed on Thursday. March coffee posted
another quiet inside day with its lowest close ever while May fell
within 20 cents of the contract low. Forecast for rain across
Brazil's coffee growing region this weekend combined with last week's
bearish world crop estimate continues to weigh on prices. March cocoa
gave us the short covering bounce we were looking for following
Tuesday's high-range close. Additional short covering is possible
however, upside potential appears limited in the face of continued
origin selling that may last into the end of the year. March sugar
finally resumed its decline off November's high after drifting
sideways for the past week and a half. Renewed fund and speculator
selling due to a lack of cash trade activity triggered today's plunge
to new lows. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling sideways to
lower prices are possible. If the decline continues 930, then 867 are
the next targets. March cotton extended Tuesday's trendline breakout
thereby confirming this week's gap marked a downside breakaway gap.
Today's loss sets the stage for a likely test of October's low
crossing at 63.75 cents later this winter. Bearish fallout from
Tuesday's negative supply and demand report continues to weigh on
prices. I would not be surprised to see a short covering bounce on
Thursday especially if export sales come in above pre-report
expectations.

COMMENT: The Money Laundering Farce Must End
by Bob Bauman, Editor.

One of the major arguments of the world money police is the imagined
need to stop ""money laundering."" They claim widespread abuse of banking
and other financial systems by sinister criminal forces. Offering little
proof, artful officials use their questionable premise to justify a
supposed right to monitor and record all financial transactions. By
design, banks and their employees have been forced into the unwanted
role of spies and police deputies.

In the only popular uprising against this arrogant attack on financial
privacy, in 1999 protests from hundreds of thousands of irate Americans
forced the US government to back down on so-called ""Know Your Customer""
rules. The KYC proposals would have made every American banker a
government vetting agent, with a duty to investigate, watch for and
report supposed ""suspicious activity"" of all account holders. (Since
then the Clinton administration has pressed banks to adopt ""voluntary""
KYC rules in spite of these protests).

From earliest history, unless restrained, governments always have used
every available tool to spy on citizens. Until this trumped up money
laundering scare the consensus in western democracies has been that
personal freedom and privacy greatly outweighed prior restrictions
aimed at potential criminal abuse. This established principle rightly
forced police and prosecutors to build each individual case on legally
gathered evidence rather than use the dragnet approach.

But now prosecutors reverse this traditional right to privacy. Instead
of a presumption of innocence, whole classes of people are viewed as
potential criminals based solely on wealth and its free use. Subject to
civil forfeiture, the accused are stripped of their assets and forced
to prove their innocence.

Are these drastic restrictions on financial freedom justified?

Existing anti-ML efforts have proven very costly and highly ineffective.
In the US in 1998, only 932 people were convicted of money laundering,
yet the cost to the private and public sectors exceeded $10 billion,
averaging more than $10 million per conviction. Based on several years
statistics, a British law professor calculated that the UK government
has stopped only 0.004% of the criminal money that flowed through the
City of London. The professor concluded: ""Money launderers do not have
a statistically significant chance of being caught, hence the deterrent
effect of such laws is negligible.""

The question must be asked: ""When is this madness to stop?"" No one
should ever have to justify he right to keep their personal business
private, except upon an individual indictment based on specific facts
presented to a court of law.

This financial dragnet must end. A continuing and expanded popular
resistance holds the key to success.

2088,"In our effort to continue to develop the Marketing Dashboard to meet your 
needs and to help you manage your business, we are rolling out our next 
release of the Marketing Dashboard.   We have taken your feedback from the 
survey as well as added additional functionality that will enhance the 
effectiveness.   Below is a list of the new functionality & features:

* Created a new graphical design with multiple pages using 'tabs' to organize 
the information better 
* Created a tab labeled 'My Pipeline' for you to customize with the 
categories of your choice
* Added a specific tab for NNG as well as the ability to add multiple 
pipelines in the future
* Additional business and market intelligence categories have been added 
through secondary tabs
* Created an Alert bar to allow you to identify specific conditions to notify 
you through the Dashboard
* Ability to add security to individual categories on the portal

Here are a few simple steps to take to access the new site:

1) From Internet Explorer 5.0, enter the link below or click on it here to 
access:
 http://nahou-wwrms02p.ets.enron.com/

2) You will be required to put in a new I.D. and password - the ID & 
passwords are the same as your LAN id: 
 * It is the initial of your first name followed by seven digits of your last 
name 
 (ex. mjanouse for both ID & password)

3) The new Dashboard will appear with defaults in each tab: 
 * You can then customize according to your needs and interests.
 * The default will prompt you to the 'My Pipeline' tab;
  - This tab contains categories from the NNG tab but with personalization 
features
  - You can remove categories from here if you do not use them in your 
day-to-day
 * The NNG tab is the replication of most of the categories from our current 
Dashboard:
  -  Some categories have been moved to other tabs.   (ex. Weather )
 * To save this new Dashboard as your 'homepage', please do the following:
  - Go to the top right utility navigation bar which says 'set as your 
homepage' 
  - Click on it and then when the window comes up for verification, click OK
  - Now, when you log on to your PC, click on the IE5 symbol 
  - Please delete current shortcut on your desktop to old Dashboard 

Here are a few notes and helpful hints to make your dashboard experience a 
joyful one:

Favorites -  Favorites are now called links and are available in the upper 
right content of each tab.  You can create as many link categories as you 
like and you may now group similar links by entering a custom title when you 
edit your list.
Memo -  The Memo pad allows you to jot yourself a note without leaving the 
dashboard.  You can create as many memo pads as you like.

2090,"NGPL Recontracts with NIPSCO

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) continues to move through the 
recontracting 
process like a hot knife through butter. Since Kinder Morgan took over NGPL 
parent KN Energy 
last year, the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements 
and contract 
extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the 
Midwest, including 
another deal announced yesterday with Northern Indiana Public Service 
(NIPSCO). 

NGPL and NIPSCO signed a contract extending the terms of several firm 
transportation 
agreements totaling 295,100 MMBtu/d of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and 
Dec. 1, 2001 
and continuing through Nov. 30, 2002. They also extended the terms of two 
storage agreements 
totaling 10.5 Bcf of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and April 1, 2001 and 
continuing through 
March 31, 2003. NIPSCO, a NiSource subsidiary, is a regulated utility that 
provides natural gas 
o nearly 700,000 customers and electricity to 416,000 customers across the 
northern third of Indiana. 

""Virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until 
the fourth quarter of this 
year,"" said NGPL President Deborah Mcdonald in an interview. 

""Basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the 
storage contracts are 
up for renewal every year. We've been very successful in our efforts 
resigning our three major 
customers [NiGas, NIPSCO and Peoples]."" Despite increasing competitive 
pressure from 
Northern Border and Alliance Pipeline, the pipeline also has had surprising 
luck signing 
agreements with marketers and power generators. 

""In contrast to the traditional market of long-haul transportation from the 
Midcontinent and 
Louisiana to Chicago, we have been extending our horizons trying to find a 
new market in 
the marketers rather than the core LDCs. Obviously the contract that we 
signed earlier this
year with Aquila Energy for 500,000 MMBtu of transportation capacity has also 
really helped 
us be successful in our recontracting efforts,"" Mcdonald said. 

""We also have developed a number of new rate services for gas-fired power 
generators. 
Growth in NGPL will come from natural gas-fired generation. You probably saw 
our press 
release about the Ameren contracts for [construction of 1,700 MW of 
generation along the
NGPL system]. In the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 
3,000 MW of 
gas-fired generation this year and over 3,000 MW next year as well [which 
would represent 
up to 900 MMcf/d in gas transportation capacity]. 

""Obviously another challenge is going to be [the 1.325 Bcf/d] Alliance 
Pipeline coming into 
the market this fall. It's anyone's guess whether that will really fill up in 
a short period of time. 
I think a lot of that will be coming into Chicago and moving back out on 
Vector. But we're 
ready at Hub America to kind of serve as a giant header system [with Texas 
Eastern as 
an eastbound partner]."" 

Mcdonald was not prepared, however, to announce the results of a recent open 
season 
for about 100 MMcf/d of capacity that will be available through a new 
interconnection between 
NGPL and Tetco for eastbound transportation. ",Recontracts Kinder Morgan Deborah Mcdonald,,NGPL NIPSCO Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America KN Energy Northern Indiana Public Service MMBtu NiSource NiGas Peoples Aquila Energy Mcdonald Ameren MMcf

AUBURN - It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburn's football team.

Five straight games had been lost. Late in Tommy Tuberville's first season as 
head coach, the team was fractured, divided by the stress of almost two years 
of trouble, despair and losing.

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

weeks, I have called back to the museum and had them send me two of the more
expensive things $20+ to save for his birthday.  Yesterday, he wanted to
know how much money we had.  I told him $10.00.  His solution:  ""Let's put
your $10 with Mom's money and Dad's money, and then we can buy the...""  His
friends in the gift shop are no help as they point out how educational all
this stuff is.  Anyway, it's your money so you should set the limit.  For
his birthday, I bought him the big I Dig for Dinosaur kit and also a
paleontology outfit--vest, pants, shirt.  He had a fit over it.  I now have
to find one of the straw hats he loved, but that went with another outfit.

Also, I cannot describe his ""change"" except as an explosion.
Formerly, he would run from dinosaur skeleton to skeleton over and over and
not spend much time at each.  Now, he studies each fossil, and he can tell
you the name of every fossil, every everything.  You would be amazed.  He
knows the name of everything there, and if he doesn't know, he gets me to
read about it.  I could not remember all that stuff if my life depended on
it.  He studies the small things--not just the huge skeletons.

Anyway, let me know.  You are going to die when you see him in the
paleontology outfit.  He thought it was about the coolest thing he's ever
seen.

2158,"Here's a rough cut.  Let me know what you think.

The fuel cells will be subjected to testing after installation to ensure that 
each fuel cell meets the performance criteria prior to CRRA accepting the 
units.  These tests will measure heat rate, electrical output, air emissions, 
noise levels and water consumption, and will last at least one hour each.  In 
addition, a seventy-two hour test will be run to ascertain that each unit is 
capable of producing the required output without outages. The final test 
protocol will establish the number of tests to be performed.

Heather:  There was a proposed ASME standard relating to the testing of fuel 
cells, but I don't know if it has been adopted yet.  If it has been, we could 
make reference to that fact that the tests will be conducted in conformance 
with ASME PT-50, or whatever it is.  I'm sure Ric knows.

Do you want hand-written or e-mail comments going forward?

Do you want more comments from Origination and Services now, or do you want 
us to wait until you turn the doc?  As I said yesterday, I am in the process 
of sorting out the ""Costs"" definition so that it works better with the other 
parts of the doc.  

MDEA is willing to extend the ILA two weeks if we want to.  Their next Board 
meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately 
need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that 
meeting.  We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until 
their Board votes on the full agreement.  The other option is to get done 
this week and have them call a special Board meeting.  They have done this in 
the past, but we have not asked them if it's logistically possible to do this 
by May 31.

In the furtherance of our noble goal to reduce the number of required 
negotiation points on future contracts,  Enron and General Electric have 
struck a plan to have a general review and discussion meeting to table and 
duscuss contract provisions of mutual interest.  The first step towards these 
planned discussions is to develop the list provisions which the parties 
believe are not currently mutually agreed, and that can, following 
discussions at the meeting, be redrafted for inclusion in future contracts 
thereby reducing the need for further discussion thereafter.

Enron's first blush at the list of items that require such attention is 
attached below.  Comments from all recipients is hereby solicited.


We look forward to also evaluating General Electric's preliminary list, which 
we understand is forthcoming.

2175,"See assignments and comments in red.  Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff responses due to Kay by noon today.


1)	General comments - 
a)	We have not seen a draft of the MPPSA or the MGPSA for review and comment. Kay
b)	All section references in the draft should be reviewed and checked.  The majority of the references checked were incorrect. Kay
c)	Since financial security is still an outstanding issue, all comments regarding the provisions in the draft pertaining to that subject have been excluded.  Kay
d)	The draft contains references throughout to exhibits that will be attached to the agreement that were not included in the draft.  See bleow.  

2)	Article 1, pages 6 and 7 - Profit and Savings: These definitions reference exhibits that were not included in the draft.   One of the most significant issues we had with the prior drafts were with the definition for ""savings"" so it is important to review a draft of these exhibits as soon as possible.   Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff to chech with Marvin.  He should have forwarded exhibits with everything else.  time is running out on them to do anything here.  Will report more on this issue.
   
3)	Section 3.1(b): This section obligates EPMI to ""Propose"" a load projection and stack model.  Should this say ""Prepare"" as opposed to ""Propose"".  ""Prepare"" is fine.

4)	Section 3.1(c): First line refers to a ""request by Customer"".  Customer is not defined, is this intended to refer to MDEA?  If not, include a definition of Customer.  ""...upon request by Customer"" is not necessary.  This has already been done.

5)	Section 3.2(a): Provides that EPMI will use ""commercially reasonable efforts"".  The draft does not include a definition for this term.  Suggest including a definition since this standard is used throughout the draft.  Kay

6)	Section 3.2(a): Suggest adding the following phrase in the second line after ""schedule Products"", ""in a manner intended to minimize the cost of serving MDEA's native load"".  Adding this seems fine; however, are there any legal implications, Kay?  If not, add it in.
 
7)	Section 3.2(c): Line 3 refers to Cajun and EPI, which are not defined in the draft.  Suggest including definitions or inserting the phrase ""Existing Contract Resources"" in place of ""SEPA, Cajun, EPI"".  The substitution is fine.

8)	Section 3.2(h): Line 1 provides ""EPMI will optimize scheduling and usage or resale (when appropriate)"".  Would suggest deleting ""when appropriate"" and inserting ""(in accordance with the terms and conditions of each Existing Contracted Resources contract)"".  The suggested change is OK.

9)	Section 4.1(a): Line 1 requires MDEA to operate and maintain its native load distribution system in accordance with Prudent Operating practices?."".  Would suggest deleting the phrase ""and the Native Load distribution system"".  This agreement does not bear on how the cities would operate and maintain their distribution systems.  Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff

10)	Section 6.4: The fourth sentence states "" due to the use of imprecise data such as weather reports, heat rate estimates and the like, it is understood between the Parties that the resulting projections, recommendations and daily plan are consistent with commercially reasonable industry practices"".   According to this provision, the parties agree in advance that the resulting projections, recommendations and daily plans are consistent with commercially reasonable industry practices.  We believe that the ""use of that type of data"" is consistent with commercially reasonable industry practices, but do not believe that that this automatically translates into the projections themselves being consistent with commercially reasonable industry practices.  Text should be changed as appropriate to reflect this change.  Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff


11)	Section 7.1: Second sentence provides ""Risk of loss and all price and unit contingency and transmission risk shall be borne by Customer"".  Suggest adding the phrase "" For Back to Back Transactions"" at the beginning of this sentence.  MDEA should not be responsible for unit contingency, transmission risk etc. for an EPMI Transaction.    Reagan/Kayne/Dave/Jeff

12)	Section 10.2(a): Line 3, change "" MDA"" to ""MDEA"".  Kay

13)	Section 14.6: Line 3, change ""and the MPPSA"" to ""the MPPSA and the MGPSA"".  Kay

14)	Section 15.1(d): provides three business days written notice to the defaulting party to cure a Financial Event of Default, otherwise the agreement can be terminated.  Three days is too short of a time period for MDEA.  Kay/David Hunt/Jeff

15)	Section 17.1: Second sentence, provides that an independent auditor reasonably acceptable to EPMI is entitled to audit all books and records of EPMI.  However this provision goes on to state that EPMI shall be entitled to audit MDEA's books, not an independent auditor subject to MDEA's approval. Suggest deleting ""EPMI shall be entitled to audit"" and adding ""An independent auditor reasonably acceptable to MDEA"".  Kay

16)	Article 28: As we have previously noted, this section contains language related to conflict of interest issues and the lack of notification related to conflicts of interest that should be read carefully reviewed by MDEA and the Cities.  Kay/David Hunt/Jeff

The language in the draft I sent out yesterday reflects our agreement during 
the conference call.  They requested something along the lines of what is in 
the email you forwarded, but I believe they accepted the following language:

SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated 
warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or 
in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 
Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that Enron will not be required to 
maintain an equity position in either of these companies.  SWPC further 
acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity 
will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts.

2295,"FYI, the ""Hanjin Muscat""  sucessfully delivered our Oman spot cargo at Lake 
Charles and departed without incident on the evening of 24 September

Because of the high price differential (ENA bought the LNG from us at $4.23 
Henry Hub price) we drew down on the LNG heel and thus discharged more LNG 
than ENA had committed to buy.  By doing this, we picked up perhaps an 
additional $50 thousand of income in excess of what was originally intended.  
I expect that our total net income from this cargo will be about $175 
thousand",,4.23 $50 thousand about $175,"FYI the ""Hanjin Muscat""   ENA LNG Henry Hub"

Enron Global Markets has experienced tremendous growth since inception and 
this growth rate will continue to increase as new businesses and markets are 
developed.  In order to ensure EGM Operations & Accounting is positioned to 
provide the highest level of support and value to each EGM business unit, I 
am pleased to announce the following organizational changes effective 
immediately.

Physical Commodity Operations
These groups, which include Crude & Products, Coal, LNG, Freight and Weather, 
are being reorganized along functional lines to provide better focus and 
promote efficiencies across these operational activities.  Weather is being 
included in this group to maintain the consistency of current Operations 
leadership in this area.

      Business Risk Controls
Todd Hall will assume the role as Business Risk Controller on a worldwide 
basis for the physical businesses.  This group will have responsibility for 
all Risk Management activities and serve as the daily commercial interface 
for all operational issues that affect the physical businesses.

North America Operations
Michelle Bruce will assume responsibility for the following activities that 
support the physical businesses for North America:  Confirmations, 
Coordination, Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Michelle and her team will 
also play a key role in coordinating operational activities as they relate to 
potential acquisitions and new business opportunities within North America.

Europe/Asia Operations
Cindy Horn will continue in her role managing the following activities for 
the physical businesses in Europe and Asia:  Confirmations, Coordination, 
Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Cindy and her team will also have the 
critical responsibility of ensuring proper controls and processes are 
maintained for all new and existing markets throughout the region.  Tiong 
Hock Lim and his team in Singapore will report to Cindy.

Financial Commodity Operations
Sheila Glover will expand her current role and manage all business risk and 
operational activities for Financial Trading and Global Risk Management.  As 
the Global Risk Management business grows, Sheila will develop the 
operational processes and infrastructure necessary to support it.

Todd, Michelle, Cindy and Sheila will also work together as a Controller team 
to ensure processes and controls are consistent across EGM and that 
efficiencies are broadly applied.

Structuring/Transaction Analysis
Scott Earnest will assume responsibility for all commodity structuring and 
transaction analysis activities across EGM.  His duties will include pricing 
and valuation of new transactions and businesses, evaluation of existing 
transactions to identify restructuring opportunities and risk controls 
monitoring and reporting.  

Technology
Kevin Sweeney will continue in his role as Technology Controller.  Kevin and 
his team will be completing the implementation of Project Thunderball for 
Crude & Products and Coal and will also serve as the Business Leads for 
system enhancements and new technology opportunities that are identified.

Financial Operations & Accounting
Tom Myers will continue in his role of managing EGM Financial Operations & 
Accounting.  Tom and his group are responsible for EGM management reporting, 
Plan & Current Estimate preparation, the financial close process and G/L 
controls.

Please see the attached organizational chart for a more detailed look at the 
changes discussed above.

 

   Please join me in congratulating everyone on their new assignments.

 Attached is the DASH for the approval of the DPR Accelerated Put 
transaction.  This partial divestiture allows us to put $11 million of our 
equity interest back to DPR Holding Company, LLC and its subsidiary, Dakota, 
LLC.  Both entities are controlled by Chris Cline.

 In addition to redeeming part of our equity interest, the deal provides us 
900,000 tons of coal priced below market, an option which could lead to a 
very profitable synfuel project, and the potential for more marketing fees 
from other Cline entities.

 The DASH has been approved and signed by RAC and JEDI II, and is now 
awaiting Mark Haedicke's review and approval.  I wanted to give you the 
opportunity to review the DASH and become familiar with the provisions of the 
deal.

 If you have any questions on the transaction, feel free to contact me at 
(412) 490-9048.  Others familiar with the deal are Mike Beyer, George 
McClellan, and Wayne Gresham.

2335,"Dear Mike:

Mr. Kent and I spoke today regarding our points in my letter to him relating
to the Contract.  Mr. Kent was very cooperative and agreed to make most of
the changes we have requested.  He is anxious to close on the lots very
soon, however.  In addition, he stated that in the event you cannot reach an
agreement with him after the purchase of the lots regarding the construction
contract itself, he would be willing to purchase the lots back at some
reduced rate, probably seventy five percent (75%), or allow you to sell the
lots to a third party provided the same restriction regarding the use of
Flair Construction applied.

I suggested to Mr. Kent that I prepare the revised Contract rather than Mr.
Larry Williams.  He agreed.  Therefore, I will draft up the new revised
Contract as soon as possible and will send you a copy first to review before
we forward it to Mr. Kent.  I intend on using the same Texas Real Estate
Commission Form that was initially used.

Unfortunately, however, I unexpectedly have to be in Austin, probably
Wednesday and Thursday.  Therefore, I will probably begin work on the
revised Contract next week.  Mr. Kent said that was no problem with him.

Very truly yours,

ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges 
A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff ""so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption"" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was ""a tortuous process."" 
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available. 
While ""both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof,"" the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting.  The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff. 
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. ""Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power."" 
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the ""index-to-index"" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate ""to minimize any risk on transportation options."" The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point. 
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations.",ALJ Jacob Leventhal Transwestern Levanthal,as much as $27 38 cents,NGI Daily Gas Price FERC Transwestern Pipeline MMBtu SET Sempra Energy Trading Richardson (Products Co. SoCal

This note is to update you on information we have related to the GTL Methanol 
project in Darwin, Australia.

Larry, John and I met with Chase/JP Morgan, specifically, the banker who led 
the financing of the Titan Methanol Plant in Trinidad. We wanted to get an 
independent opinion on the financeability of the current GTL structure and 
insights into the current market for project bank debt for commodity deals.

The key opinion of Steve Nordaker, the Chase banker on the Titan deal, was 
that project banks do not take commodity price risk unless they have a very 
clear, supportable view of the long-term market price for that commodity. As 
for methanol, with the high level of uncertainty about the demand and price 
for methanol as tied to the future of MTBE, Steve said that Chase would need 
a profit margin contractually guaranteed by the project documents before 
lending to a project. Steve further suggested that if the gas supply contract 
had a floating price tied to methanol prices with a floor price, that floor 
should be around $0.50/ mmbtu to give the lenders comfort that the plant 
would remain competitive over the years required to repay the debt. GTL has 
agreed to a fixed price of $1.02/mmbtu with Phillips. Chase would not lend to 
the Darwin Methanol project as structured with a fixed price for the gas 
input and an index price for the methanol off take. Nordaker thought that it 
would be very hard to find even one bank to take the unhedged risk on the 
methanol margin. In fact, GTL will need at least ten banks to raise the full 
$250 million of senior project debt.

Another key risk that Chase would not take is the strength of the Sponsor, in 
this case GTL. GTL has a total market cap of approx. $30 million. It will 
have to issue new shares equal in value to more than its current market cap 
to fund its portion of the project equity. If the project experiences cost 
overruns, the Lenders will expect someone with a high credit rating or 
demonstrable financial strength to invest whatever amount is needed to finish 
construction. 

I think that GTL is taking a big risk of wasting several months before 
finding out that its project is not financeable. In addition to the waste of 
time, GTL will have signed a gas supply agreement that will have to be 
renegotiated, and other key documents may need to be amended. EGM will not 
get the methanol it wants on time and may be faced with the choice of 1) 
taking on extra methanol price risk (by agreeing to buy more of the plant's 
output at a fixed price or by providing sponsor support) or 2) dropping out 
of the deal. If we have hedged some risk in anticipation of the project 
succeeding, then we will face pressure to take on more risk to cover the 
hedges.

I think that GTL's deal is fixable, and John wants the methanol. I, 
therefore, recommend that we push GTL on several key structural elements so 
that GTL achieves a feasible project and so that EGM receives its methanol on 
time. Because EGM is only willing to buy 1/3 of the plant's production of 
methanol at a fixed price, the most important point is to get Phillips to 
agree to a floating gas price. Kevin Alexander of GTL says that they have 
tried, but that Phillips would not accept it. If necessary, we should offer 
to intervene with Phillips. We will, also, try to keep GTL realistic on the 
time it takes to negotiate project documents (six to nine months) and to 
issue public equity (no limit if the markets turn bad).

John, Larry and I are developing a plan to move GTL to a realistic structure. 
We may need your help with Phillips. We will keep you apprised.

Contractor Time Entry

Contractors are required to enter their time in eHRonline to one of the following: (1) project numbers, which are called WBS Elements; (2) cost centers, which are associated to a specific department and not a formal project.  It is the Supervisor's responsibility to ensure Contractors are provided with the proper project or cost center coding.

Unlike invoice coding, SAP will only accept a Cost Center or WBS element number for each time entry line.  This means that you cannot enter a Cost Center and a WBS element number on the same line.  SAP will read this information from left to right and will only pick up the first entry.  For example:

dad!

I am doing the U of H Exec MBA program.  I go to school all day Friday
and Saturday every other weekend.  As you can see, this is my weekend
off from class.  The most attractive thing about the program is that
it's only a year long!  So, we started in Jan and graduate in Dec.  This
year has already been intensive though with working full-time and trying
to study, read, and write case studies.  FYI-Enron's VP of Corporate
Finance (Dan Castagnola) is in my class and he is very funny. The class
discussions have been pretty interesting so far and since I am the
youngest person in the class I have learned quite a bit from others.
Almost everything is done in these teams that you stay in all year.  I
know it will be worth it though come December.  I would have liked to
have done UT's program because of the name and recognition but with me
being in Houston already this was most feasible. So, pray for me and I
know everything will be ok.

And yes, you are getting old but I am sure you look as young as you were
in high school 'cause I know I do! (smile)
But no, really, I do! :)

2400,"Armando, further to our conversations please find attached my calculation of the values we are seeing in the marketplace. The information provided is for discussions between Mexicana and ENA and is not to be distributed to any other party. 

As discussed, ENA's economics are based on a variety of assumptions including volumes ( that actually flow ), basis market, tariffs, and credit, not withstanding the paper we will be looking at executing. 

I believe Enron is your best choice in counterparties and we very much welcome the opportunity to act on your behalf as Agent in the liquidation of the transportation on El Paso.  

In summary, and as previously discussed I would like to submit a term sheet to you based on a summary of the documents and steps we will need to impliment to get this agreement in place. Here are just a few of the important doc's and potential next steps:

NEXT STEPS:
?	Mexicana needs to decided on confirm that you have chosen ENRON NORTH AMERICA to act as your AGENT. 
?	If ENRON is deemed agent then we need to ""Accelerate' the steps in the documents summary.


DOCUMENTS:
?	Drafting and execution of Agency agreement  between Mexicana and ENA
?	Drafting and execution of physical confirm  to facilitate the Monthly and Daily purchases ENA will make at the border ( Topack) with Mexicana
?	Potential Deemed ISDA agreement to facilitate swaps ( to hedge spreads if so desired ).
?	ENA requires ( copy of By-Laws ), even if they are in spanish, we will need these to take next step ( we have the ability to review internally) 
?	ENA requires power of attorney documentation
?	Execution of Agency agreement between Mexicana, El Paso Natural Gas and ENA. 
?	Satisfactory credit review

2414,"Here is an update on Oakhill power sourcing:

      Wholesale Generation + Ancillaries
?	Electric cooperatives and municipalities are exempt from retail deregulation.  We can not directly contract with AEP or whoever the wholesale generation provider would be because it constitutes a retail sale in a non-deregulated area.  The prevailing utility in the area must be the buyer of the power.
?	Generation + ancillaries will be provided by the chosen entity, through NTEC, and then through Rusk.  The wholesale generation + ancillaries contract will be a three party agreement between AEP (or whoever is chosen), NTEC, and Rusk.
?	Swing - There are consumption penalties for using more or less than the contracted 5.0 MW 7x24 block (meaning there is no free swing).  These penalties are part of the ancillary services, which means that we will not have the exact specifications until Rusk receives the bids on their RFP on 6/27/01.

T&D
?	T&D is provided directly by Rusk County Electric Co-Op.
?	NTEC is charging us $0.20 / MW as an administrative fee (mark up), which is why the fixed T&D cost from Rusk County is $10.20/MW and not $10.00/MW.
?	There will be a minimum T&D charge from Rusk, above which we pay for only what we use:
o	For example:  We pay the minimum charge or actual usage, whichever is higher.

Ricki is constructing the T&D only contract (which he claims will be similar in structure to the previous contract), with the inclusion of T&D pricing and swing.  I also reminded him that he needs to provide the audited financial statements to us.  Attached is a deal diagram with the most current information that we have.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.

2423,"Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8

EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

 Attached please find a revised draft of the Support Agreement
reflecting a release of the capacity without recall rights, but with our
right to subsequently instruct ENA to release the capacity back to us if
permitted in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.  We continue to be
concerned about the protection of our rights in the event that ENA is
unwilling or unable to release the capacity back to us when and as required.
However, in the interest of wrapping this up, we are prepared to move
forward with this structure, with some words added as indicated.

 With regard to other open items.

 - the text of the Spread Value Calculation needs a little tweaking
to have its terms correspond with those in the Support Agreement.  For
example, defined terms such as ENA and Pipeline Capacity should be used.
Also, the 200 basis points added to Libor should be deleted.  Gerald, are
you going to conform or should I?

 - The Amendment to the Master Netting Agreement looks fine.

 - Stephanie should work with Bob and El Paso to agree on the form of
release needed to implement the Initial Release with El Paso.

2498,"Jefe:

Hotel expenses- anywhere from 200-600 yuan per night ($25-75 USD). Totally  
depends on what hotel you chose and how nice a room you want. In general, 
you'll probably be choosing to stay in middle tier lodgings.

Unfortunately, hotel rates in China aren't cheap. When I first travelled 
through southern China in 1997 I budgeted myself 300 yuan ($37 USD) per 
night, but ended up staying in group dorm-style backpacker rooms and paid 
much less. However, you and Cathy probably won't be adopting this approach on 
your short excursion.

  In Shanghai Ai Ping and I usually stay in an old hotel named the Pujiang 
(built in 1846 by a Brit). It's strategically placed on the Bund (waterfront) 
and is quite decrepit yet funky. We pay about 200 yuan for a double bed. This 
is probably the cheapest double in Shanghai, and thusly all the backpackers 
flock here. If we want a newer, cleaner and more comfortable double we 
usually pay anywhere between 350-600 yuan per night ($43-75 USD).

  Because you are a white-skinned foreigner (and in China this automatically 
means you're a millionaire) and because you can't speak Chinese you'll 
probably be quoted the highest fare the hotel clerks can dream up.

Remember: in China every price is negotiable, and if you don't play the role 
of greedy Westerner and bargain for 2-3 minutes to get a lower price THEY 
WILL EAT YOU ALIVE. If you don't haggle with them over the price you are 
considered a fool and automatically deemed unworthy of their regard- and they 
will make you pay five times the actual price of the room AND THEN THEY WILL 
CONSUME YOUR LIVER. This is what makes me wary of sending you out on your own 
with little or no language skills. You will be preyed upon by everyone in 
every business transaction. You are not a human, you are a dollar sign with 
two legs in China.

> Basically, it goes something like this... You walk into a hotel that claims 
to be of 4 star quality. In truth, this means that the hotel is probably 
desperately clinging to a 2 star level. You stroll up to the front desk and 
ask what the room rates are. The clerks will give you a schmaltzy brochure 
with photos of the rooms and a price list AND THEN THEY'LL DECIDE WHAT SAUCE 
TO COOK YOU IN. The double-bed room is listed as 700 yuan. You then ask the 
clerks if this is the real price. They'll probably say yes AND WONDER AMONGST 
THEMSELVES WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO MAKE A SOUP OUT OF YOU. You 
then ask them if they can give you a lower price. If they refuse you smile 
benignly and offer to pay them 300 yuan for one night. And then the fun 
begins AND THEY'LL BEGIN TO GORGE THEMSELVES ON YOUR STEAMING INTESTINES.

> Meals- anywhere from 4 yuan to 1000 yuan (50 cents - $125 USD). You can get 
a huge bowl of steaming rice and two big dishes of wok-fried bliss for a buck 
in China. You can also go to the other extreme and spend thousands of yuan on 
a meal if you want to get ridiculous. In China food is religion. They dissed 
Buddha, adopted Mao as supreme being for a couple decades, and then retreated 
to their one true love: eating. Every Chinese city has about 9 billion 
restaurants ranging from hovels that cater to the peasant/construction 
workers (these are the ones I frequented, but Ai Ping won't let me go 
anymore) to the new rich. Don't worry about food prices. You'll probably be 
choosing semi-decent establishments. Expect to pay between 30-80 yuan per 
meal ($4-$10 USD).

> Speaking of meals, did you know that the Australian aborigines LOVED to eat 
Chinese seamen? It's actually very well documented. The Chinese sailed 
throughout the South China Sea which borders the Philippines, Indonesia, 
Vietnam etc. It seems that the aborigines thought the Chinese had very 
sweet-tasting meat and considered them a delicacy. They were a highly 
sought-after food item 500 years ago. My Australian boss uses this small fact 
against his Chinese students whenever they begin to spew racist theories 
about the cosmic worthlessness of aboriginal cultures in Australia: and it 
horrifies them.

> Airfare- cheaper than the states. Let me get exact airfares from Ai Ping.
 She made a list of fares between cities, but it's not available at the 
moment.

> Trains- cheap. To give you an idea... Taiyuan>Wuxi (22 hours/hard-sleeper  
class) is about 300 yuan ($37 USD). Basically, this train goes from Shanxi 
province (north-central China) to Jiangsu province (southeast China). Can 
supply you with more examples if you need them.

> Money- bring travellers checks and some cash (fifty-hundred dollar bills). 
Yes, some bigger hotels and banks offer ATM services but don't rely on credit 
in China.

> Duration of stay- your call. Sounds like you are dealing with two busy work 
schedules. Come up with a trip that you're both comfortable with. You should 
see some places other than Shanghai and Qingdao, but you needn't create a 
breakneck schedule either.
 Destinations- talk it over with the folks. Do you want history or nature? 
Northern or Southern China? Han culture or minority cultures? Villages or 
cities? Think it over and get back to me.

Additional Information about YPAY:

Aspiring Youth is a locally-founded 501(c)(3)
nonprofit organization that operates innovative programs for at-risk youth,
such as Aspiring Youth? After-School Programs, the Take A Student To your
Employment (TASTE?) Program, College for a Day Program and the ""Positive
Youth Development"" TV show. More than 500 students from nine Houston-area
middle schools will participate during the 2000-2001 school year.  For
additional information, please see Aspiring Youth's website at
www.aspiringyouth.org

The goal of YPAY is to involve Houston's young professional community in
these fabulous programs and demonstrate by word and deed what it takes to
be successful in the professional world.  Many of the children that attend
Aspiring Youth's programs have never met or seen a doctor, lawyer,
accountant, banker or engineer or have any conception of what it is like to
work in professional atmosphere.  Your participation in YPAY will provide
these youth aspiring to such jobs with badly needed positive role models
and better acquaint them for the challenges and effort required to achieve
success in the professional world.  In the process, you just might meet
some interesting people and have a good time.  A proposed mission statement
is attached below.

At present, we envision that YPAY will not only contribute volunteers to
Aspiring Youth's programs, but also have periodic social events and
establish a quarterly speakers series.

fine to send this to Bridgeline.  

Please note that I did leave an open question on the fee structure.  The 
agreement currently provides for a flat fee of $10,000 per month for the 
services.  Do we need to be reimburse for any third party expenses to perform 
the services or would all services be internal and included in the flat fee?

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC =
- 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards aga=
inst Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent wee=
ks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents cont=
inue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Xtreme Updated 11/25/=
01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards=
 against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy ri! sk=
! because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - She Said Updated =
11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his=
 quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any =
Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in th=
e AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/25/01 Brooki=
ns rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble.=
 The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most=
 teams right no! w.!   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Cali Bound Updated 11/25/01 Day=
ne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on=
 him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB=
 NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and=
 a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played w=
ell recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a mo=
re consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated 11=
/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day agains=
t Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, includi=
ng 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hi=
llrods Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and=
 two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the=
 matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - She ! Sa! id Update=
d 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a t=
ouchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a re=
serve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods U=
pdated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes fo=
r 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliabl=
e Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.=
   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Countryman Updated 11/25/01 Jackson=
 had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards =
and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he=
 is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Leather Chee=
rios Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes f=
or 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in re=
cent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB O=
AK - Xtreme Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley car=
ried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in=
 short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting f=
or any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he m=
ay not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smi=
th , RB NE - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense=
 and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has beco=
me a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE -=
 Baby Blues Updated 1! 1/! 25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orle=
ans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty re=
liable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on=
 the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea=
 Circus Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no inter=
ceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continu=
ed to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , =
WR ARI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01Sanders left Sunday's game against San=
 Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay J=

nd Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointme=
nt for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing o=
f the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agen=
t! Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards,=
 three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy con=
sideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gads=
den , WR MIA - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 11=
8 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. =
Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these importan=
t final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/25/01Fi=
edler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His p=
erformance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still =
too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - =
2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards a=
nd 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia =
QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI=
 - Pumpdog Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught fo! ur! passes for 32 yards again=
st Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy tea=
ms as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Baby Blues Updated 11=
/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie h=
as slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a ris=

dated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis playe=
d through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good ba=
ckup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known =
to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/0=
1 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted=
 decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 =
yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - KMB =
Express Updated 11/25/01 Muhamm! ad! missed Sunday's game against Atlanta d=

d 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a ri=

 disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - The Wounded=
 Ducks Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for =
only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with =
their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers=

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

We are also feeding the neighbors dogs  etc. while they are gone so we need to get back. Hope Lauren is feeling better and everyone else is OK.

After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called ""PACE"", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

sorry for the delay and thanks for thinking of me.  

i missed you at thanksgiving as well!  canadians celbrate thanksgiving

so i had a good time anyway.  

i'm hoping to catch up with you and kt over the holidays.  i'm planning on
being on the east coast from dec 16 - jan 3, mostly in northern va.  are you
going to be in bethesda at all?  also planning a trip up to NY.  

yes, enron is in a bad way.  i'm doing fine, but it hasn't been a pleasant 
month at work with layoffs and massive uncertainty about future of the
company.  i've resolved to not worry about it until the new year and it seems
to be working!  still planning on staying in calgary but who knows?  

let me know about your holiday plans!

in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, things are looking up.  

eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much.  

i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was thinking about stopping by after that.  should i call eze's cell?  or do you have a cell #?

          It's great to hear from you!  I am so happy you are back at Enron.  
I would love to go to dinner with you and Cindy and catch up.  It's hard for 
me to go to lunch these days due to EOL.  They bring lunch in everyday and we 
generally stay in to run our products.  Just let me know when & where you two 
can meet.  Maybe we can do it soon and  celebrate the upcoming  holiday

And

Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference

January 22-25, 2002, New York City, NY

 

OVERVIEW

 

In the current environment of volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).

The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods.

This conference will highlight the commonalties and common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the enterprise.

This is a revised Plano we did late yesterday. It was adjusted from Lowell, 
Mass Nepco estimate and we changed format to more closely match  Homestead 
form.

Biggest differences 'tween original Plano and original Homestead were:

Homestead had dual fuel     +4M
Homestead had additional piling and foundation bulks  +1.8M
Homestead was connecting to a complicated t-line config +1.5M
Homestead had an FPL substation    +5M
Homestead did not need as much gas pipeline    -2.1M
Homestead used 6% margin     +4.4M
Homestead had lower capacity due to additional chilling  +1.5% (not capital 
cost but does change $/kW)

Differences from original Plano to new Plano is that Nepco has estimated a 
union job for Lowell. This impacts indirects upward by about $5M and 
construction up above my earlier guesstimate by about $4M. I had doubled the 
cost per manhour which Nepco also did but additionally they added manhours 
for productivity loss. Additionally I moved new Plano margin to 6%.

New Homestead went up due to raw water pretreatment and first stage RO but we 
dropped the substation cost so total estimated cost went down by a coupla of 
million.

Numbers still just should be used for screening, no commitment. 

These summaries should not be passed around.

2664,"I know the following goes without saying, but I wanted to highlight a few 
specific points relevant to this transaction.

As all of you know, the sale of Brownsville and Caledonia to Cinergy was 
recently announced.  As the press release indicated, the terms of the 
transaction were not released.  While Allegheny (with the sale of the 2000s) 
took the same position in its announcement, the purchase price was 
subsequently released to the market (by Allegheny).  Cinergy and Enron both 
agreed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, to not release the price and terms 
without the other's consent (i.e. THE PRICE AND TERMS WILL REMAIN 
CONFIDENTIAL). 

To the extent legally permitted, Cinergy will not release the price as part 
of its regulatory filings, and in fact, will redact the price from all of its 
filings.  If, through your involvement in this process, you inadvertently 
learned the price, you must keep it to yourself.  As we all know, information 
moves around this organization very quickly.  With two deals on very similar 
assets in the market at once (Allegheny and Cinergy), it only makes sense to 
contain the external flow of information.

By the way, both transactions should close March/April 2001.

Thanks for your help in this process, and your co-operation in keeping this 
information confidential.

Regards,

Here is a Calpine deal summary. 

ENA would sell four LM-6000 turbines to Calpine.
Calpine would be responsible for permitting, constructing, financing and 
operating the peaking power plant in Eastern PJM.
ENA would enter into a short-terrm tolling agreement to buy power from 
Calpine for 3 or 5 years.
Work needed to be done :
 - getting VOM for LM-6000 from EE&CC.
 - getting flat capacity payment ($/kw-mo period) for 3 and 5 years from 
Structuring group, based on VOM, Heat rate, dispatch, and location of the 
plant.
 - building 20 year economic model to understand Calpine position. 

Profit generator: We buy power from Calpine at lower price than that of ENA 
bid curve.

I think it will be helpful if Thomas call EE&CC to get VOM ASAP, so that we 
can talk to Structuring group. Please review and let me know if it makes 
sense, and then I will send you, Scott, Richard Park, and Tom Swank.

If someone needs to have just Eastern PJM curve, we can try to get from 
Structuring group tomorrow. Richard Park told me about PJM curve but I am not 
sure what exactly this is for. Thank you.

     package.

7.  I may not be the best looking guy in here, but I'm the only one
    talking to you.

    Thrasher, have you seen one?

9.  I'm fighting the urge to make you the happiest woman on earth
     tonight.

10.  Wanna play army? I'll lay down and you can blow the hell outta
       me.

11.  I wish you were a Pony Carousel outside Walmart, so could ride
      you all day long for a quarter.

12.  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that was a braille name tag.

13.  I'd really like to see how you look when I'm naked

14.  Is that a ladder in your stockings or the stairway the heaven?

15.  You might not be the best looking girl here, but beauty is only
       a light switch away

16.  Are those real?

17.  You must be the limp doctor because I've got a stiffy.

18.  You can feel the magic between us...No, lower!

19.  I'd walk a million miles for one of your smiles, and even
       farther for that thing you do with your tongue.

20.  Girl, if you were a porch I'd take out all the nails and screw
       ya

      we could do it in public.

does not name Enron entities.

Thanks

",Aguirre Gary,,Henricks Enron
2707,"Jim -- the following are our concerns about PG&E's proposal/possible points 
to make in a response:

1. Enron would be one of the largest unsecured creditors in the event of a 
PG&E bankruptcy; our claim may become even larger  depending on the extent to 
which we acquire additional claims against the utilities through the PX or 
ISO.  We are therefore interested in any action that would reduce the pool of 
assets available to unsecured creditors.  
2. This proposal may be to our benefit, or to our detriment.  There is not a 
great deal of detail in the proposal currently on the table, and Enron needs 
additional information in order to evaluate the proposal.   Certainly, we 
need to evaluate this in light of other developments.  

3. The proposal contemplates pledging ""existing and future"" receivables to 
secure obligations owed to gas suppliers; PGE shows approx. $1.3 billion in 
A/R as of 9/30; will that (or an amount of like magnitude) be pledged as 
security under this plan?  Granting gas suppliers security may be fine with 
us, but we don't have a great interest in OVER-collateralizing their 
positions.  More current information on the current A/R balances and the 
extent to which obligations to suppliers will be secured will be helpful.

4. Do they intend to extend this security to ALL gas suppliers, or only those 
that are refusing to supply PGE under current circumstances?

5. Do they intend to secure obligations on a going-forward basis only, or 
will they also secure their obligations with respect to payables that have 
already accrued?

6. PG&E is scheduled to make a couple of large payments to ENE tomorrow; what 
is PG&E's ability to make those payments for gas already delivered?

7. Given the extension of the DOE order, it seems that consideration of this 
petition could be delayed for a few days to allow interested parties 
sufficient time to evaluate its implications.

Give me a call with any questions.

In light of the DOE extension of the emergency gas supply order, there should 
now be adequate time for PG&E  to respond to these points and clarify their 
proposal.

2710,"Following the first instance decision in the Civil Summary Proceedings, Ross, 
Teun and myself met with Clifford Chance again yesterday to stress-test our 
litigation strategy going forward and we arrived at the view that, at the 
current juncture, the strategy we laid down over the last 10 days or so is 
still correct.

That strategy - with an anticipated time-line is as follows:

1. Friday, 26 / 5:  We file an Urgent Appeal on the Civil Summary proceedings 
in the Civil Court.  (We spent some time yesterday reviewing the draft Appeal 
proceedings).  This is the last date for filing an Appeal on the Summary 
proceedings. 

2. Between now and the end of next week, we try again to get Sep to confirm 
in writing the amount of t-o-p they have for energy, minimum cross-border 
capacity required, etc. on their import contracts. 

3. Mid-June:  Accordingly to CC's latest intelligence, the current 
anticipated ETA of the DTe's decision in the Appeal on DTe Decision 005.

4. Around mid-June:  Judge decides whether or not we are going to be granted 
witness hearings on t-o-p obligations of Sep (these will fall away if Sep 
complies with point 2).

5. Mid-June:  If we get a vague or adverse decision by the DTe re point 3, we 
lodge an appeal in Summary Proceedings before the CBB (the Administrative 
court) against the DTe's decision in the Appeal on DTe 005.  Appeal will 
probably be lodged on grounds that Sep contracts violate EU Directive.    

Note:  if the DTe's decision is adverse (e.g., t-o-p relates to capacity not 
energy), then our Civil Appeal (point 1) will at that stage fall away.

6. Mid-August:  Earliest possible date (per procedural rules) for Decision of 
CBB in Summary Proceedings Appeal (if launched) per point 5.  Could be later.

7. End-August: Earliest possible date (per procedural rules) for hearing of 
Civil Summary Proceedings Appeal per point 1(note:  this will be heard if 
either DTe makes a decision favourable to us in mid-June per point 3 or if we 
get an adverse DTe appeal decision, but we get a favourable CBB appeal 
decision per point 6 - in the latter case the Civil appeal will, in effect, 
be ""re-instated"").

In practice, this appeal might not be heard however until end October.  

8. September: Witness hearings - unless Sep complies with 2 and judge does 
not reject our request for witness hearings per point 4.

9. (End??) December:  According to latest CC intelligence, NMa will probably 
make decision, and hence report, on our NMa complaint filed in January re 
TenneT's alocation of cross-border capacity for the Y2K.    


Additional Notes:

A.  The benefits of lodging an Appeal against the decision of the civil court 
in the Civil Summary proceedings are (a) gives us additional litigation 
optionality, (b) keeps the pressure on the system,  (c) if we are successful 
on the DTe 005 appeal, or were successful in a CBB appeal against an 
unfavourable DTe 005 appeal decision, then this Civil Appeal goes to 
enforcement of that decision against Sep / TenneT and (d) was perceived to 
have no material down-side.

B.  I have requested Clifford Chance to let me have (1) estimate of costs of 
launching Civil Appeal + estimate of costs which we would have to pay to Sep 
/ TenneT if we lost that Appeal and (2) total of our legal costs to-date, 
broken down between those we have paid, and those which have not yet been 
billed or billed but unpaid + estimate of our legal costs going forward on 
the basis of the above strategy plus estimate of costs payable by us to 
defendants if we lose any of the above actions going forward.

C.   It will be noted that the above does not take into account any Brussels' 
angle.  This needs to be reviewed again when DTe makes decision on the 
Decision 005 Appeal - i.e., probably mid-June.  

D.  CC still attempting to find out when CBB will in effect decide whether or 
not TenneT is an administrative body (which impacts the forum, and hence to a 
certain extent, the above time-scale). 

E.  Clearly, legal strategy is not caste in stone but may change depending on 
how the litigation chess-game unfolds over the next succeeding weeks and 
months.  This will be constantly reviewed.        

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

status of the Amparo proceeding related to the Vitro project.  The attached 
analysis clearly differs from the information provided by the Lopez Velarde 
firm at the end of December when they indicated the Amparo proceeding should 
be dismissed by the end of January.

As I believe you are aware, the dismissal with prejudice of the Amparo 
proceeding is a condition precedent to first disubursement under the Vitro 
Loan Agreement.  Although there are still many other conditions that must be 
satisfied before first disbursement can occur, we do not anticipate that six 
weeks will pass before such conditions have been satisfied. 

Therefore, I contacted the inhouse attorney for the lender, the 
Inter-American Development Bank, to discuss the status of the Amparo 
proceeding with him.  At my urging, he has agreed that the Inter-American 
Development Bank will waive the dismissal of the Amparo proceeding as a 
condition to first disbursement and will, instead, require that the 
proceeding be dismissed prior to second disbursement.  I have been informed 
that second disbursement will not occur until at least a month subsequent to 
first disbursement.  In such case, it is anticipated that the waiver of this 
condition to first disbursement will provide sufficient time for the docket 
to be cleared and for the Amparo proceeding to be dismissed prior to second 
disbursement.

The project company will be required to request in writing that the 
Inter-American Development Bank waive this condition precedent and such 
written request will be prepared after a review to determine whether other 
waivers may be requested but in sufficient time for the Inter-American 
Development Bank to process the request through their internal channels prior 
to the date of first disbursement.

2718,"John Novak called me Wednesday to assist in handling a dispute involving EPE 
and the Cuiaba project.  EPE entered into a PPA with Furnas, the government 
entity buying power to sell to distributors.  Furnas is wrongfully 
withholding its consent to assignment required by the banks (OPIC and KfW) 
for financing this project.  We believe Furnas is acting  in bad faith and 
has no contractual right to withhold its consent which gives EPE a right to 
issue a default under the PPA. 
EPE issued a default notice to Furnas and Eletrobras (the guarantor of 
Furnas' obligations under the PPA) in  September of 2000.  The grace period 
to cure the default has expired and EPE is now analyzing whether to proceed 
with termination of the PPA, to initiate arbitration over the dispute, or to 
follow some other course of action.  

Furnas  is using the assignment consent as leverage to hold up financing and  
force EPE to renegotiate the PPA because of commercial risk and loss it has 
incurred resulting from delay of  Phase II of  project.  By way of 
background, EPE issued a force majeure notice under the contract last year 
for delay in building the project as a result of the Mato Grosso attorney 
general's investigation and imposition of tedious environmental measures that 
have caused significant delay in building the gas pipeline to the plant over 
the ridges region of Caceres.    EPE has no contractual obligation to remedy 
Furnas' losses resulting from a valid force majeure delay and no obligation 
to renegotiate the contract.  The PPA contains an ICC arbitration clause 
(arbitration in Paris) and Brazilian law governs the contract.  We are also 
investigating alternative remedies to resolve the matter.  

John Gardiner of Skadden Arps in New York will act as counsel on 
international arbitration.   Fernado Serec with Tozzini Freire Teixeira e

2728,"Richard,
 Here is my quick reaction to the idea of Enron terminating its PX
participation agreement in the Core Market:

 1. PX tariff 18.3 says that a participation agreement ""may be
terminated by either party upon written notice.""

 2. PX tariff 5.3 says with respect to the Core Market
Proportional Charge-Back Methodology:

  ""The PX Participant's outstanding default amount will be
charged back to all current PX Participants based upon the percentage of its
gross sales in MWHs to the Total gross MWHs sales in the Core Market during
the three calendar months preceding the event plus the current month to
date.""

  3. PX Participant is a defined term:

  ""An entity that is authorized to buy or sell Energy or
Ancillary Services through the PX, and any agent authorized to act on behalf
of such entity.""

  4. Energy is also a defined term:

  ""The electrical energy produced, flowing or supplied by
generation, transmission or distribution facilities, being the integral with
respect to time of the instantaneous power, measured in units of watt-hours
or standard multiples thereof, e.g. 1000 Wh.

  5. Ancillary services is also a defined term:

  ""Regulation, Spinning Reserve, Non-Spinning Reserve,
Replacement Reserve, Voltage Support and Black start together with such
other interconnected operation services as the ISO may develop in
cooperation with Market Participants to support the transmission of Energy
from Generation resources to Loads while maintaining reliable operation of
the ISO controlled grid in accordance with good utility practice.""

  Bottom line:

  If a PX Participant, as defined in the PX tariff as opposed
to the PX rate schedule for the CTS market, is an entity that is authorized
to buy or sell ""instantaneous power"" rather than power in the future, then
Enron by withdrawing from its PX participation agreement would no longer be
a current PX participant.  Thus, there is an argument that by withdrawing in
writing prior to any chargeback in the core market, that Enron may be able
to argue it cannot be charged back.

  I also looked at the ADR and dispute resolution procedures
to see if Enron had to be PX Participant to initiate the procedure and
maintain it.  Schedule 9 section 1.1 states that PX ADR procedures shall
apply to all disputes between parties which arise under PX Documents.
Section 2.1 states that the ""PX and PX Participants shall negotiate in good
faith..."" It goes on to state in Section 2.2 that ""any one of the parties""
may submit a statement of claim.  Thereafter, in Schedule 9 it appears that
the references are to parties not PX Participants.  My quick reading is that
you still have to use and get the benefits of the ADR even if you are no
longer a PX Participant.

  Operational Downside:

  Does Enron have to be a PX Participant to get the PX to
schedule the power that Enron has sold in the CTS market as it becomes due?
In other words, if Enron is not a PX Participant, does that mean the PX will
not schedule the power leading to an Enron default under its obligations to
the PX to deliver power?  Could that lead to the underscheduling penalty if
PX  balances its schedule without Enron's power?  I do not know the answer
to this but I am reviewing the tariff.

  Hope this helps
  Thanks

2730,"USA: UPDATE 1-Calif. seizes stranded SoCal Edison energy contracts.
  
02/02/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 


SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - California Gov. Gray Davis on Friday blocked 
the California Power Exchange from liquidating stranded energy contracts held 
by cash-strapped utility Southern California Edison, seizing the assets for 
the state.


The governor's office said the order, issued late on Thursday and put in 
effect on Friday, was needed to ""preserve"" the contracts' value for 
power-starved California consumers.


""I am using my emergency powers to seize options to buy very inexpensive 
power that would otherwise be lost forever,"" Davis said in a statement.


""These options will provide reliable power through the end of the year. It is 
important to protect these contracts for the people of California,"" he said.


A Los Angeles judge on January 24 issued a temporary injunction, valid for a 
week, blocking the exchange's sale of the contracts.


The California Power Exchange (CalPX) said Davis' order nullified a Los 
Angeles County Superior Court decision earlier Friday that authorized CalPX 
to liquidate Edison's forward market positions.


The exchange said they had sought to liquidate the contracts to recover about 
$255 million that Edison has failed to pay to CalPX market participants.


While agreeing to transfer the contracts to the state, the exchange pointed 
out that the law requires that California pay a ""reasonable value"" for them, 
which it estimated at nearly $652 million on today's market.


Delivery of the first contracts, which total 2.8 million megawatt hours, is 
scheduled to begin Monday, February 5.


One megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to light 1,000 
homes for 60 minutes.


Davis is desperately seeking cheap power for the state after the utilities' 
financial meltdown pushed them to the market's sidelines. Spot market 
purchases for the state are currently being made by the Department of Water 
Resources, but at typically higher prices than in the ""forwards"" market.


Block forward energy contracts secure electricity deliveries over a given 
""block"" of time at a price agreed months in advance, shielding the buyer from 
the kind of price volatility that has recently roiled the short-term ""spot"" 
market.


The overall value of SoCal Edison's contracts, agreed last year for power to 
be delivered in 2001, was not immediately known, but CalPX officials said 
last month they hoped their liquidation would cover the $215 million 
SoCalEdison owned the exchange.


SoCal Edison, the utility subsidiary of Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison 
International, has warned it is no longer able to meet its financial 
obligations after running up a debt of nearly $5 billion buying wholesale 
power in the spot market, where prices have soared ten-fold over the past few 
months amid a regional energy shortage.


The utility is blocked by the state's 1996 deregulation law from passing 
these high wholesale prices down to consumers, who are still protected by a 
rate freeze.


That same deregulation legislation created the CalPX, making it the 
state-sanctioned exchange for electricity trading. SoCal Edison was among the 
biggest buyers on the exchange.


CalPX, crushed by a mountain of debt it is unable to recover from Edison, has 
shut its spot market operations and is winding down its business affairs.

2754,"As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

offered another position in Houston and one in Oklahoma City but the severence
package looked more attractive than either of those positions.  I've agreed to
stay through the first quarter for the transition.  I'm considering a new career
as a wine taster.  It don't think it will pay well but it would be a lot more
fun!!

Thursday is fine for me.  Le Vista also sounds good but the high temp is
predicted to be below 40 on Thursday.  In case the prediction is correct, do you
know of another place where we can bring our own wine?  If not, we can just go
to my house which is only a couple of blocks from there.

Robert Hunzinger from Owensboro gave me a call this morning to find out the status of his contingent call option with Enron.  

I told him that since ENA was one of the bankrupt entities, that it would be highly unlikely that he would get paid if his option were to strike this summer.  His determination period is June 17, 2002-August 30, 2002.  

Not sure if you'd like to give Robert a call or not, just wanted to let you know that he had called in regarding his swap.

Deuthsche Bank served a credit notice to ECT Investments Inc. for the ""triplets"" trade.  This trade is not ECT Investments Inc.'s.  All the Credit business was transferred to Enron North America on November 2000 and the Credit book was transferred to Enron Credit Inc. in February 2001.  This trade should not be in ECT Investments Inc.'s name and should have been transferred by Enron Credit.

I would expect Enron Credit Inc. to settle the financial liablility of this trade and not leave it as an obligation to ECT Investments, Inc.

2822,"Hi Sara.  

With all due respect Sara, I have a constructive suggestion for both of us. 
In Anna's view, and I agree, it is causing some unnecessary confusion that 
you call her to negotiate provisions of the contract that I am negotiating 
with her without my knowledge.  It makes both you and I look disorganized and 
in doing so, I beleive it undermines our position in negotiating the terms.   
As a practical matter, it is extrmemly difficult to negotiate a contract and 
administratively organize the execution if I am not sure whether there is 
someone else taking steps (especially with outside counsel that I am not 
aware of.)   If you have asked me to negotiate an agreement -- as in the case 
of Enron Credit Inc. -- and you have an update on the status -- having sat in 
on the conference call on Friday, then why not let me do so?  At the very 
least, could you call me first for an update or try to include me in the 
call. 

Equally important, while I am sure that it is not your intent, you are 
undermining my morale.  I have constantly kept you updated  -- sometimes on 
an hourly basis -- on the status of what is going on with all of the 
administrative and legal tasks.   To call outside counsel under those 
circumstances  comes across as a vote of no confidence in my work and efforts 
which is baffling to me because I think I have worked hard and have 
accomplished a tremendous amount with respect to the brokerage agreement 
project.   I have negotiated these agreements with a great deal of 
thoughtfulness and skill. I have gone above and beyond even to determine 
applicable law that no one else was aware of.

Moreover on Friday (again without intending to do so) you undermined my 
morale by telling me that there were administrative tasks that needed to be 
done.  You said that you hope I know that the agreement does not just become 
executed once we sign it.  Sara, it should be obvious to you that I know -- 
perhaps better than anyone else -- what administrative tasks need to be 
accomplished to open this kind of brokerage account.  I have even figured out 
that there are administrative tasks beyond what any one else is aware, for 
example, in the case of the ancillary NASDAQ agreements, that no one else was 
aware had to be completed.  I have proven already that I can execute all of 
the administrative tasks in an expedited manner.  

I want these comments to be taken in the spirit in which they are given -- 
which is that we both mean well and are working toward a common goal and that 
everyone can learn from anyone.  I look forward to talking to you further so 
that we do not let the frantic nature of our work make any one feel that 
their efforts are not valued.

Moreover, with the exception of the email dated on the 20th, the other emails 
are not addressed to me; indeed, a major concern of mine which clearly slowed 
down the execution of this package of agreements  was that I was not included 
in conversations about the status and any change in deadlines etc.  Perhaps 
in part that is because for the bulk of the time period in which we worked on 
Enron Credit Inc., you took responsibility for the Bear Stearns agreements 
until you turned the agreements over to me at 3 p.m. on Friday the 12th and I 
began, at that time a legal review of the agreements.  Moreover, no one 
represented to me at that time that this agreement had to be done first and 
right away.  I just learned that last week from the business people when I 
reported that the Morgan agreements were ready for execution.  I had 
completed my review of the other two Enron Credit Inc. account agreements.  
Furthermore, you indicated that I should keep the paralegals involved; my 
records of this project indicate that you asked Stephanie to complete the 
Authorized Officers list, and that you had signed off on it.

f=20
Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred=
=20

Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B) Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

2. Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing=
=20
broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with=
=20
the broker=01,s obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remain=
s=20
responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules.

3.  Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member =20

Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g) the account number;
(h) the brokerage rate;
(i) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with=
=20
the executing broker for that account; and
(j) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that=20
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifi=
cs=20
of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time,=
=20
and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such information=
=20
shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4. Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed=20
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in=
=20
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker=01,s discret=
ion,=20
reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution.  T=

2854,"On Wed, I met at EPSA to discuss with members - the near term future 
participation of EPSA staff and members at NERC.

A roster of participants follows this brief summary.

Most members agreed in concept that NERC must continue to be monitored at 
least in the near term because of their ""monopoly"" on the 
reliability/commercial rules.  There was agreement that NERC had moved into 
the commercial/non-reliability standards setting partly becuase the 
incumbants desgined it that way and partly due to a lack of another industry 
representative forum  for FERC to delegate to.  Some members were encouraged 
that GISB was interested in becoming an alternative forum (EISB) and pointed 
to GISB successes in creating an efficient Bulletin Board for Gas in response 
to FERC orders.  The members also realized that most of the NERC problems are 
caused by the native load exception which the gas industry did not have to 
deal with making their restructuring easier.

EPSA staff will focus on representing EPSA members' viewpoints to the 
independent board members to establish working relationships and to provide 
market perspectives as well as governance problems within the NERC 
structure.  

Many EPSA members also felt that EPSA staff could do more to provide 
information regarding NERC issues that affect the markets so that a greater 
number of members can convey their positions to the NERC Committee and 
Subcommittee market representatives. Some possible email/members only 
bulletin board was discussed.

Reliant (John Orr) also expressed concern over continuing to allow NERC (as 
opposed to the RTOs)  to set the commercial standards.  Most agreed that NERC 
does not design efficient commercial/market standards and should leave the 
non-reliablity rules to RTOs.  Others (myself, DENA, Ontario Power Gen) who 
participate on NERC groups agreed to this in concept but raised the problem 
that many of the reliability rules overlap commercial rules with no ""bright 
line"" between the two.

2868,"I am pleased to announce that a new feature is being added to the E-Tag 
system: the Potential Adjust List (PAL).

As you may or may not know, there is currently an ""Adjust List"" that is 
issued when TLRs are called. An ""Adjust List"" is a recommendation from the 
IDC that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve 
needed relief to eliminate a constraint.  This Adjust List sent out to 
Generation and Load Control Areas and Tag Authors for all transactions that 
are being recommended for curtailment.  It is intended to aid in coordination 
Control Area schedules during curtailment, as well as alert the marketplace 
of recommendations for their transactions to be curtailed. Under the current 
process, the Adjust List notice is sent out when the initiating Security 
Coordinator and all impacted Security Coordinators have agreed to recommend 
specific curtailments.  As such, this recommendation can occur very late, 
leaving very little time for the market to react (i.e., resource and/or 
resink their power).  

The Potential Adjust List feature adds a second, earlier Adjust List that is 
sent out when the initiating SC requests relief, but prior to the 
confirmation of all the impacting SCs.  This should allow this recommendation 
to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today, giving more time for 
the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks.  When 
all impacted SCs confirm, the standard Adjust List recommendation is sent out 
as it is today.

It should be recognized that both the Potential Adjust List and the standard 
Adjust List do not represent actual curtailments - in both cases, they are 
only recommendations for curtailment.  Control Areas may elect to curtail 
different transactions or amounts than reflected in either Adjust List due to 
local relief procedures or other business practices.  However, both lists 
should aid in mitigating risk associated with physical transactions and 
curtailments.  Further, empirical evidence seems to indicate that in the 
majority of cases, the Potential Adjust List, standard Adjust List, and final 
curtailments will be very close.

This change is based a proposal I wrote with the help and support of Jim 
Eckelkamp (Carolina Power and Light), Mark Scheel (Dynegy), and Patt Terris 
(Exelon Power Team).   If you talk to any of them during the course of daily 
business, please thank them for their support of this effort.  With their 
assistance in developing the concept, ironing out the technical details, and 
cultivating NERC support in the various forums,  we were able to implement 
this change very quickly. 

I expect this change to take place sometime between June 15 and June 28.  
Attached, please find a message from NERC that describes the feature and how 
it works.  If you would like more detail, please let me know.  I currently 
Chair the group that is responsible for improving E-Tag, and as such, am 
intimately familiar with tagging and its functions.

In the next few weeks, I will be working with Don Baughman and Juan Hernandez 
to ensure we utilize this feature (and others) to maximize the value of our 
E-Tagging tools.  As indicated above, please feel free to contact me with any 
questions.

how to deal with non-jurisdictional entities.  Other topics on which we may

Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will 
be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., 
core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address 
(e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is 
what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,"" 
comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a 
comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to 
the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue 
its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue 
requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be 
suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to 
review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 
15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and 
will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed 
decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of 
the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the 
Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.",Joe Dutra Joe Nation Edison MOU Hertzberg,,Hertzberg the CA Assembly Assembly Legislature PUC DWR Direct Access Commission

Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more 
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.
RICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group 
of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has 
aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of 
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private 
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to 
Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the 
Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per 
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & 
Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour 
charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 
an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for 
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and 
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. 
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, 
according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased 
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more 
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest 
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have 
reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said. 
""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the 
generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400% 
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging 
us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting 
ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on 
the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's 
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first 
quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the 
first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's 
energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited 
to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the 
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. 
""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in costs since 
his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in 
January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to 
$271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded 
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one 
of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per 
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a 
total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a 
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average 
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of 
Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be 
reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, 
the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered 
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, 
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see 
the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached 
Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing 
the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, 
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas 
prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, 
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems 
in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state 
projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June 
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under 
$100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited 
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term 
power contracts with with ""moving the California electric energy industry 
closer to normalcy.""

Just wanted to give you some updates from my presentation in Toronto.

1. I used alot of material from Lay's speech.  Changed it a little.  I think 
I did ok (although I referenced airline competition in Canada - something you 
guys haven't yet put in place).

2. The general tone of the day was that Ontario has some more work to do.  It 
doesn't appear that the parties were really ready to move ahead with 
competition.  California wasn't discussed too much.  Many people are worried 
that the rules don't really promote competition - which they don't.

3. OPG indicated at lunch that they want competition, but that it was up to 
the parties in the meeting to make it happen.  Most people were in agreement 
(quietly).

Given the huge value loss for ENA if we don't get it open, I'd like to know 
if there is anything else we can do to help you.   There are some new 
Competitive Analysis guys that may be able to help us find some leverage - 
pls give me a call.  Finally, I saw Lavorato in the airport on the way back 
to Houston.  He is ready to help and recognizes the importance of this 
activity.  I think that he can get Lay and/or Skilling whenever through the 
Summer.

If you can push this through, this is a huge win for Government Affairs.  
This is easily the biggest Regulatory Origination opportunity we have this 
year.

2923,"At the request of the NEB, TransCanada has sent out a notice to shippers and interested parties
for comments on TCPL's application addressing the proposed Mainline Services and Pricing 
Settlement.  They are also requesting comments on ""the need for and the nature of a further process
to consider the Application"".   Comments must be filed by Wednesday, May 23,2001.  

Kevin Heal from our Calgary Office, represented Enron in the Settlement discussions.  Enron elected
to abstain when the vote was taken to approve the Settlement.  Sithe/Independence voted to
oppose and litigate the Settlement.

To maximize the value of the Sithe/Independence TCPL capacity (i.e. St. Clair to Chippawa & Kirkwall
to Chippawa contracts), it is very important that Sithe continue to actively participate in the
NEB's regulatory process and file comments by the deadline.  Behind the scenes, I 
recommend that we work with Sithe's legal counsel to coordinate a response to this 
request in case this capacity is assigned to Enron at a later date.  

I also recommend that Enron either change our earlier position from abstention to 
opposition of the Settlement, or combine the Empress to Chippawa contract that is
dedicated to the Sithe/Independence deal with Sithe's other capacity.  Kevin has 
provided the attached information of the other Toll Task Force members that voted to abstain, 
oppose, or oppose and litigate the Settlement.  It appears that most of the marketers, cogens and
IPP's fall in this camp.  

There are several features to the Settlement that may create additional value that 
has not yet been captured in our restructuring analysis.  I believe that only by taking 
an aggressive stand in the regulatory process, can this additional value be realized.  TCPL's
""FT Make-Up"" and ""AOS"" features will create additional value for 2001 and 2002.   The ""Turnback
Procedure"" is designed to mitigate actual costs of TCPL's proposed Waddington and Niagara
expansions.  If some, or all of Sithe's capacity can be turned back to the pipeline, value may be
created starting in late 2002 and possibly through the termination of Sithe's contracts.

If there is any other information needed or I can assist in any way, please call me at x31667.

We are planning to talk about the different interconnects within our region as well as the east desk, plans to replace gas, what legal considers force majeure and rankings.  I have invited the schedulers from the east and upstream desks hoping that this will help facilitate discussion and ideas on how to resolve problems should a hurricane happen.   

Kirk Lenart is also in the process of working with Unify team to create reports out of Unify to enable us to track cuts in Unify rather than on a spreadsheet.

IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.
To trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory  with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email.  
We encourage all or our users to take a serious  look at the new weather products being offered by the IntercontinentalExchange.  Please contact one of our following representatives to find out about the new  weather products, or check back on our website product guide:

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:

Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.

2956,"Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.

2971,"John,

This is my view on what may be possible:

Steve:	Issues:	1. Uncomfortable with UBS's committment to the business
		2. Surprised that no one from UBS has spoken directly with him
		3. Seems like he wants to build/run a team and is motivated by money.
		4. His interperetation of the contract is that even if this deal fails, his would be bound by a none compete until the end.

	Solution:  Money alone is not enough because does not address 1 and 2.  He needs someone (senior) from UBS to spend some time with him to:
		   (a) help him fell more comfortable with UBS's committment; (b) get him excited by the possiblity to lead/shape/direct the weather group
		   (this notion seemed to catch his interest during our discussion with him); (c) and present him with a new deal (no more of this aim for 80%
		   happy bullshit).  This new deal will need considerably less restrictive language--talk with Hunter about specifics.

Adam:	Issue:  1. Has interest in returing to the air force (his window to do so is until July 7th.)

	Solution:  Appears that money is not his first priority.  Any offer of money that precludes him from the July 7th window will be unsuccessful!
		   Our strategy needs to be one that gives him some respectable money that he can keep as long as he stays until June 1st (after he is
		   committed it may be possible to persuade him to stay longer).  He will not accept an offer that takes away his air force option!!!!!!  Also,
		   I think signing him will be alot easier once others have committed.

Jose:	Issue:	1. Recongnizes that senior management (You, Greg, and Louise) have done a good job closing the deal, but have failed to address HR
		    issues.  He thinks that this failure has existed much longer than just during the bankrupcy.  (Quoted, ""Mike had to fight way to hard
		    to get the very basic things for his team since day 1."")

	Solution:  The most difficult of the three to sell.  I think the ONLY hope would be for him to regain trust and respect for senior management. Senior
		   management would need to sitt with him and LISTEN to his issues!!!!

Mike:	Issues:   1. He wants out!!!!!!!!!!",John Steve Hunter Adam Jose Recongnizes Greg Louise Mike,,UBS

I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may 
help you prepare for Thursday.

Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this 
production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily 
load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 
55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal 
differences in load.

Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However 
these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume 
more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the 
regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and 
move gas to the areas of greatest demand.

Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if 
the daily production is growing or shrinking.  

Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.

Dear  Jeff:
 
I know  with your departure from Enron tomorrow and with the loss of friends and  business associates on Tuesday you have much on your mind.  For those  reasons, I hesitate to contact you now, but realize from my personal experiences  that this may be the very time at which you wish to consider  opportunities.  I have briefly outlined below my present venture.  I  am asking energy industry acquaintances for assistance in identifying  prospective investors.  In your case, you may wish to consider an  investment and, if you desire further involvement, the company will offer you  one of its five Board seats.  I wish you well in your future personal and  professional endeavors.
  
I am CEO  of Genscape, Inc., a two-year old, $3 million annualized revenue, energy  information provider, serving Fortune 500 companies.  Genscape has  delivered and deployed proprietary technology making it the exclusive provider  of real-time online power generating and transmission operating information.  Energy traders have shown great interest in Genscape's information with five of  the nation's largest energy traders subscribing to the service at annual prices  of $500,000 or more. With only $200,000 in equity investment to date, Genscape  has developed its proprietary technology, organized a 27 person staff, completed  one third of its monitor deployment and generated strong customer demand.  It's a great start upon which to base  expansion.
 
Genscape  and Vectren Energy Solutions, have reached an agreement as to the terms for  issuance of $3 million of Series A Preferred Stock of which Vectren will buy  half. A copy of the term sheet signed is attached. Vectren was the principal  investor in EnTrade Corporation, of which I was a founder, and realized a  significant return in EnTrade's strategic sale to Tenneco Energy. Genscape has  also received strong interest from a financial investor for $500,000. Due  diligence and closing documents are substantially complete and this transaction  is ready to close by late September.
 
Genscape  is seeking the remaining $1 million of investment capital required and will  accept $100,000 minimum investments. I need your assistance during the next few  days to identify individuals or businesses that may wish to make such an  investment.  I will contact them  personally, once you provide me their contact  information.
 
I plan  to be in Houston on Friday, September 14, and at least one day during the week  of September 17 and can meet with prospective investors personally, if they  desire.

I am a YPOer in the Rebel Chapter who was given your name from an IOS source
as someone who could potentially help in this situation. As background, I
sent this IOS request out last week:

Description of Situation
My highway construction company has been negatively impacted by price
volatility in energy prices (fuel, natural gas, and asphalt cement). We
offer long term, fixed price contracts to our clients yet must purchase our
petroleum and energy-related products at spot market prices. Thus we are
exposed to significant price adjustment risks.

Does anyone have experience using commodity contracts as an arbitrage
strategy to offset the risks of potential price volatility in the energy
sector? If so, do you have specific recommendations for how we should
proceed?

Thank you for any information you can offer.

As I have investigated this further, I find no one in this industry (highway
construction) who is purchasing futures to mitigate their energy cost
exposure. I have spoken with folks who are doing this in the building supply
sector with lumber futures.

Do you have any thoughts or suggestions in this matter? Any input would be
greatly appreciated.

Many thanks,

I don't think we have any open slots, but pass your resume on to me and I 
will pass it on.  When would your rotation begin and would this be a second

Please add add a link called ""Plant Outages (portland)"", to the Gas 
Fundamentals website under the Power tab.  The description is as follows:

""Query of Portland's database of plant outages for yesterday and today.""

Thanks.

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a 
slight change.  Please modify the title to read ""WSCC Plant Outages 
(portlant)"".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add 
an additional link under the Power tab called, ""Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)"", 
with a description of ""Daily plant outages posted on the web by the 
California ISO.""  The file will be called ""ISO curtailments.xls"".  Thanks.

The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each 
pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and 
highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be 
tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative 
pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where 
appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT 
group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know 
if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to 
incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.

A Change in Plans

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling you
in advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've
made a few small changes:

Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.

Once inside, our guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with
the swags of Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make. Instead,
I've gotten the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in
colorful autumn leaves from the front yard. The mud was their idea.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or
crystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will get a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it is
a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you while
you wait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have
made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please
remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering
that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to
the children's recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the
children should mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or
that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes
dryer, ignore them. They are lying.

We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've
also decided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm
sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit
of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a
separate room, next door.

Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at
our dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private
ceremony. I stress ""private"" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter
the kitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small,
unsuspecting children to check on my progress. I have an electric knife. The
turkey is unarmed. It stands to reason that I will eventually win. When I
do, we will eat.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that
""passing the rolls"" is not a football play. Nor is it a request to bean your
sister in the head with warm tasty bread. Oh, and one reminder for the
adults: For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence
of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its
lesser-known name: Cheese Sauce. If a young diner questions you regarding
the origins or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance. Cheese Sauce stains.
Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small
fingerprints. You will still have a choice; take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probably
won't come next year either. I am thankful.

Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1310&""><B>Michael Westbrook</B></A>, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1003&""><B>Jake Plummer</B></A>, QB ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=12623&""><B>Michael Pittman</B></A>, RB ARI - Dont Mess <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries.

If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1112&""><B>Lamont Warren</B></A>, RB DET - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1171&""><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - President Taft <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=1265&""><B>Keyshawn Johnson</B></A>, WR TB - Orange Roughy <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01!

FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=235247&""><B>David Terrell</B></A>, WR CHI - Really Rottens <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=133228&""><B>Marty Booker</B></A>, WR CHI - Luccis Losers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4638&key=187385&""><B>Plaxico Burress</B></A>, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards.

The closest I ever got to a 4.0 in college was my blood alcohol content.

I live in my own little world. But it's OK ... they know me here.

I saw a woman wearing a sweatshirt with ""GUESS"" on it.   I said,
""Implants?""

I don't do drugs any more 'cause I find I get the same effect just
standing up really fast.

Sign in Chinese pet store: ""Buy one dog,   get one flea.""

I got a sweater for Christmas . . . I wanted a screamer or a moaner.

I don't approve of political jokes . . . I've seen too many of them get
elected.

The most precious thing we have is life, yet it has absolutely no
trade-in value.

I love being married.   It's so great to find that one special person
you want to annoy for the rest of your life.

Shopping tip: You can get shoes for 85 cents at the bowling alley.

I married my wife for her looks ... but not the ones she's been giving
me lately!

Two peanuts were walking down the street. One was a salted.

If carrots are so good for the eyes, how come I see so many dead rabbits
on the highway?

Isn't having a smoking section in a restaurant like having a peeing
section in a swimming pool?

Marriage changes passion ... suddenly you're in bed with a relative.

When next time you feel like complaining, remember: Your garbage
disposal probably eats better than thirty percent of the people in this
world.

Snowmen fall from Heaven unassembled.

Every time I walk into a singles bar I   can hear Mom's wise words:
""Don't pick that up, you don't know where it's been!""

Many people will walk in and out of   your life, but only true friends
will leave a footprint on your heart

I just got through redrafting for October to pull in the new storage volumes and prices. It looks like there are three new demand charges.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief as S.E.C. Looks at Dealings

By FLOYD NORRIS

The Enron Corporation (news/quote), its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, whose involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as C.F.O.,"" Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ""continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.""

The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer.
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.

The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half since Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered when they later learned about it.

On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr. Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions.

The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand.

By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected to address.

Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - either in cash or with stock - if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assured investors that the company ""expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,"" and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate.

Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in business strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.

According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time was the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving Mr. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMahon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.

Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest price for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after- hours trading, they fell to $16.14.

One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ""sell"" from ""hold."" She had lowered the rating to ""hold"" from ""buy"" on Monday.

""After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,"" she said in an interview yesterday evening, ""Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.""

We are exploring ways to obtain previous day's hourly meter read through MDMA.  Are you planning to store hourly metering data in Project Ranger as well?  And when do you plan to have these data available for access?  Of course I can't speak for everyone but I think we will be more than happy to get the data from Project Ranger rather than from CSC.

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

3068,"I recently went through the list and weeded out the ones that don't have 
deals under them.  Unfortunately, Enpower contains the CPs for Canada and the 
Emissions group, which are sometimes similar names.  Sometimes Europe 
attaches CPs by mistake and we have takenf them out also.  Name changes and 
mergers also complicate things.  What we do is keep an eye out for the 
incorrect CP and try to inform the traders when they are picking the wrong 
CP.   Believe me, if the developers could differentiate the CPs in Global CP, 
it would be done.  I guess the issue is how much time and money it would 
require to change CP to feed just our CPs.  And on APS, they have informed us 
that they are still trading under both names until 1/1/01 and credit is okay 
with this.  I could go on and on about all the issues, but you get the idea.

3081,"Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

intention was to manage it within Livelink. However, this platform does not 
seem to provide a workflow that is smooth and user friendly enough, and 
consequently we may go for a Word document only instead. (Under this latter 
arrangement, we would place a template on a shared drive that all concerned 
parties could access.)

Whether we go for Livelink or a Word document only, we will need to create a 
template with information about the reference entity. My initial thought is 
that we would have three main fields: One information field about the entity, 
one field for Credit an one field for Legal. The suggested information to 
input would be the following:

Information field about the entity: Name; Name of ultimate parent; Country of 
incorporation and operation; Name of originator making the request; Date of 
request; Comments field.

Credit: Approval/Rejection tick box, Comments field; Credit ratings (public 
and Enron); Tenor and mark-to-market limits; Name of person handling the 
request.

Legal: Approval/Rejection tick box, Comments field; Name of person handling 
the request.

Could you please let me know you need if you feel that the provided 
information is sufficient and let me have your comments.

Also, I understand that Debbie, Bill and Rod handle the Credit approval.

or approve purchases from pens to pipe and cable to computers.  Our Global 
Strategic Sourcing (GSS) and Global Accounting groups have teamed up with 
each of your Business Units to build a tool designed to meet your specific 
needs.

Special iBuyit features include:
? An eCatalog to help you quickly find the items you need
? Shopping baskets to store your purchases
? Simple recurring purchases 
? Automatic routing of invoices for coding and approval

iBuyit will be implemented in stages across ETS, EBS, EES, EWS, Corporate and 
Europe during 2001.  

Over the next few months, you will be hearing more about iBuyit from your 
business unit leadership, including what it can do for you and when you can

to convince Dave Forster and Louise of this, but I do not know if I will get 
anywhere.  Their argument is that they do not want EOL deals terminated for 
any reason, and they have the same point we do - if the numbers are not 
significant, what is a few more confirmations....  But - I am working on it, 
just having a hard time getting commitment right now.  In the meantime, we 
have gotton word to all the back office personnel that they should not be

Leslie - please offer commets/suggestions from the power perspective.

Mark - final approval will need to come from you since this is a financial 
product.

Also, trading wants us to consider price changes for the Product because the 
prices published do change from time to time. I know that the ISDA 
Definitions contemplate a 30-day true-up, but I can't find a like provision 
in the GTC. So - I took a hack at some language to contemplate the issue:

""If the price published (as set forth herein) on any day during a 
Determination Period is subsequently corrected and the correction is 
announced within 30 calendar days of the original publication date, the 
parties agree that the corrected price shall take affect as if it were the

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Dear Mr. Collins:

RE:	Docket No. RP00-336-000

Pursuant to the procedures agreed to at the August 28 technical conference in the referenced proceeding, Enron North America Corp. submits the following informal data requests:

1.	Please specify the receipt points that are associated with each of the twenty pools that El Paso proposes to use for allocation of receipt point rights in this proceeding.
2.	For each of the specified receipt points, please provide on a monthly basis the average daily volume of gas that was scheduled for receipt into El Paso's system for each month from January 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001.
3.	For each of the specified receipt points that is not an interstate pipeline interconnection, please indicate whether, to the best of El Paso's knowledge, gas from supply sources upstream of the receipt point can be transported on any other pipeline, i.e., whether or not they are split-connected.

I regret that when you called yesterday you didn't feel that anyone outside of me knew what was going with your portfolio.  Let me reassure you that there are several that are part of the team that immerse themselves in the accounts that we manage.  Unfortunately, insurance products are held at the insurance company.  We have submitted the proper paperwork to change the broker dealer.  That has been done.  Now we're waiting for First Union to network the annuities into your account so we can see them daily.  We at anytime can call Venture and get values and allocations.  We also have your profile on a spreadsheet where we track your Venture piece, 401k, Accounts with us etc...
Let me give you the result of the Annuities;

2106218    Current market -$6,718.00  Grip value 12,617.  Currently in Cash

2016219  Current market - 52,187.00  Grip value
100,880.85.  Currently in Cash.

2235338  Current market- 204,005  Grip value
222,923.  Currently in cash.

2235337  Current market- 137,391  Grip value
160,636.  Currently in cash.

2235339  Current Market- 40,101  Grip value
44,584.  Currently in cash.

2235336  Current Market- 15,586.  Grip value
17,700.  Currently in Aim All CAP.

The grip value is the guaranteed value through annuitization.  You have a guaranteed growth rate of 6% on an annual basis, with a step up election if the market value has performed greater than 6%.  The markets were great in 98 and 99 with the first annuities that we made an invest in.  We stepped up the market performance and that is why the grip value is at the levels listed.  We are in the final stages of the annuities being networked into your accounts.  One has already shown up on the account.  The other 5 should follow through shortly.  I'll track it daily and keep you posted.  The important thing for you to know is the the positions are in cash, except Josephs (I spoke to him last night, he sure sounds like a fun guy) annuity.  Hope that this helps.

I'm not sure who needed to receive this information so I am sending it to both traders that have forwarded me the spreadsheet.  Bridget Williams from EES spoke with Jane on Wednesday 9/5 regarding the missing purchases for 4/01 and 5/01.  The sales side of these transactions have been pathed but as my spreadsheet shows we are indeed out of balance by their purchase volumes.   I will also need to get resolution on these issues as soon as possible.  If you have questions or problems please let me know.

Have you ever experienced problems accessing the network remotely when traveling on business or when trying to work from home on your Enron laptop?  Would you like someone to test and customize the dial-up access on your laptop before you head out of town on your next trip? 

We have identified a need and are now supplying a new service for Corp and EBS employees and it's called Ready2Go !

This new service has been established to test, modify, and update the dial-up software on your laptop.

How it works:

Go to the site and schedule a time that is convenient for you. Then, bring your laptop to our testing site, (either at 3AC105 or EB2268D).  We will examine your system, update your software (if needed) and even customize it for the next location you will be traveling to.  We'll also provide a training session in accessing the network remotely with your laptop.

If you are interested in participating, simply access the web site and schedule an appointment.

3174,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=

Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the

This is true.  The master agreement would apply only in the event we would
be buying gas from Enron on a long-term basis.  Typically, Nova and ANG
would have your company assign the capacity to SMUD on their contracts.

A01-09-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  A Meet and Confer meeting was held on Tuesday to discuss a revised procedural schedule.  Given the ALJ's directive that SoCal must submit a revised BCAP application to reflect the unbundling decision and to include both the LRMC cost methodology and the embedded cost methodology on March 4th, two procedural schedules were submitted to the ALJ for consideration.  SoCal presented a schedule which retains the original Hearing dates to begin on May 21, 2002 and with a final decision by the end of 2002 to allow for implementation of revised rates on Jan. 1, 2003.  The Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) submitted a schedule pushing the hearings back to late August and seeking a Commission decision by the end of March 2003.  The parties were unable to reach a consensus, however more parties objected to the SoCal schedule than the ORA schedule.  An ALJ decision should be forthcoming.

AZ Legislature.  Due to revenue shortfalls in the current fiscal year, Gov. Hull has announced that  an emergency session beginning Jan. 29, 2002, will need to be called to deal with an estimated $200 million deficit.  On the table for possible cuts are surpluses in special funds such as the tobacco education fund, the Heritage Fund for parks and game preserves and a special lake fund.  Others feel its time to use the remaining ""rainy day"" fund of $160 Million.  However with a $850 Million deficit expected in 2003, the Gov. wants to keep this fund intact.
