We have moved the Board Meeting on Wednesday night at 6pm to
Chris and Judy Simon's house at 4141 Oberlin.  We're going to
give you a chance to kill two birds with one stone.  
We will have the annual fund letters there for you to put 
personal notes on so you won't have to make a second trip.  
(We know we're already asking for a lot of your time this week.)
Plan to come early before the meeting and/or stay after to sign
your letters.  Judy will have wine and hors d'ouvres.

Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.",,,Enron Federal Credit Union Enron the Credit Union Credit Union Enron Corp.

Sara: we'll discuss this in the morning.

Thanks

Talked to Bill O'Brien today.  He contends that Select made required payments, with the exception of some holdbacks which were clearly documented and provided to Enron.  Select wants to perform under the contract until that time we can mutually negotiate an early termination.  He is faxing 26 pages of information which supports Select's previous payments.

Bill requests that Enron:
q	Provide current written payment instructions
q	If we cannot resolve the payment dispute tomorrow (demand letter deadline), rescind the demand letter w/ rights to reopen after analysis is complete
q	Have Enron's attorney contact Select's attorney (see fax cover sheet for contact information)

Bill expressed concern that Enron would send a termination notice tomorrow (3/8/02) prior to resolution of the payment dispute.  I assured him that our intention was to resolve the payment issue if possible, reserving that we might agree to differ if resolution isn't possible.

I thought I noticed a Senior designation and thought it kind of strange.  

Yes, all the documents were provided to E&Y in hard copy form in the binders delivered to Raj last week.  The only document not included was the Florida Power & Light Company (""FPL"") agreement.   However, under the EWS-CCT address you now possess all the Master Netting Agreements (including the FPL agreement) in the electronic/pdf format.    

If you want to present E&Y with the electronic/pdf versions, you will need to do that.

each other on a weekday night or something (I had heard this Wed. for the two

the winner possibly playing the Andersen winner (if they decide to play).

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Marshall is suffering from a knee injury and is questionable for Tuesday's=
=20
game against the Raptors.  David Benoit will get extended playing time if=
=20
Marshall is unable to play.   =20

 Vin Baker , F SEA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/04/00=20
 Baker sat out Sunday's game against the Warriors due to a knee injury. =20
Jelani McCoy and Rashard Lewis got extended playing time in his absence. =
=20
Look for that to continue until Baker returns.  For now he is listed as=20
questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Detroit.   =20

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Sabonis missed Sunday's game at Phoenix due to a sore knee.  He has now=20
missed three games in a row and is questionable for Wednesday's game at=20
Toronto.  When Sabonis finally returns look for him to come off the bench f=
or=20
a few games before returning to his job as the starting center.  Dale Davis=
=20
will start at the pivot until then.  =20

 Hubert Davis , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Davis missed his third straight game Sunday due to a strained groin. =20
Courtney Alexander replaced him at shooting guard.  Davis is questionable f=
or=20
Tuesday's game at Houston.  When he finally does return to the lineup he ma=
y=20
find that Greg Buckner or Michael Finley has replaced him at the two-spot. =
  =20

 Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Nash sat out Sunday's game against the Lakers because of a bruised calf. =
=20
The Mavericks went with a backcourt of Howard Eisley and rookie Courtney=20
Alexander in his absence.  Nash is questionable for Tuesday's game at=20
Houston.   =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Buckner played for the Mavericks Sunday after missing seven straight games=
=20
prior to that with a sprained foot.   It will take him a while but Buckner=
=20
will become a productive Fantasy player again in a few weeks, if he is stil=
l=20
healthy.     =20

 Chris Mullin , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Mullin is still suffering from a sore knee and missed his fifth consecutiv=
e=20
game Sunday.  If you have Mullin on your team hoping for a miracle Fantasy=
=20
season, it's time to let go.  It appears that Mullin won't be well enough t=
o=20
help a Fantasy team this season.    =20

 Chris Porter , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 With Chris Mullin and Chris Mills sidelined, Porter got the first start of=
=20
his career Sunday, playing small forward.  He responded by scoring 18 point=
s=20
and grabbing six rebounds.  Look out for Porter.  He is extremely athletic=
=20
and could develop into a surprise Fantasy star in the upcoming weeks.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Carter is listed as day-to-day with a sore left knee, but will accompany t=
he=20
team on its three-game road trip. Head Coach Lenny Wilkens said that Carter=
's=20
availability for the trip won't be determined until Tuesday. It may be a go=
od=20
idea to sit Carter this week until his return date is a bit more clear.    =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/04/00=20
 The Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to practice with t=
he=20
team on Monday and may be available to play against the Celtics on Tuesday=
=20
night.  If Hill's injured ankle is still tender, however, he will likely wa=
it=20
until Orlando's West Coast road trip next week before returning. Fantasy=20
owners who have been waiting for Hill's return should keep him on the bench=
=20
until he has been cleared to play by the team.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Gill, who is currently stuck in a horrendous shooting slump, may find=20
himself either on the bench or being placed on the injured list. Gill has=
=20
been bothered by tendinitis in his right knee, which has made him feel like=
=20
he is ""playing on one leg.""  Fantasy owners who were expecting Gill to be=
=20
productive should seriously consider benching him until he is healthy enoug=
h=20
to perform at a higher level. =20

 Fred Hoiberg , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Hoiberg is less optimistic that he will be able to play against the=20
Timberwolves on Tuesday after testing his sore left ankle in a workout on=
=20
Saturday.  He is listed as day to day, and hopes to return for Chicago's=20
weekend road trip through Texas. Hoiberg, like many of his Chicago teammate=
s,=20
holds very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Brand missed practice on Sunday after sustaining a left knee hyperextensio=
n=20
at the end of Friday night's loss to the Knicks. He will have an MRI=20
performed on Monday and is listed as questionable for Tuesday's game agains=
t=20
Minnesota. Brand leads the Bulls in scoring (18.8 ppg) and rebounding (10.4=
=20
rpg), and is one of the top forwards in the world of Fantasy.  Owners may=
=20
want to put Brand on their bench this week until the extent of his injury h=
as=20
been determined.  =20

 Chris Herren , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 Herren has been placed on the injured list because of his sore shoulder, b=
ut=20
remains optimistic that he can return soon. ""I'm going to rest it a bit and=
=20
see how it goes,"" said Herren. If the injury persists, surgery may be his=
=20
next option. Herren isn't a very value Fantasy player, so his injury won't=
=20
effect most owners.   =20

 Mitch Richmond , G WAS - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00=20
 Richmond injured his right knee in Saturday's game against Miami, and didn=
't=20
make the trip to Detroit for Sunday's game with the Pistons. He will have a=
n=20
MRI done on Monday to determine the extent of the injury.  If you have=20
Richmond on your Fantasy roster, it may be a good idea to keep him on the=
=20
bench this week. =20

 Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00=20
 The Washington Wizards, who traded Ekezie to the Clippers last week, have=
=20
picked him up off of waivers. Ekezie, who was released by the Clippers=20
shortly after the trade, had averaged 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in his=20
first stint with Washington.  He holds no Fantasy value.  =20

 Glenn Robinson , F MIL - The Old School Fools Updated 12/04/00=20
 Robinson, one of three starters who began the game on the bench for missin=
g=20
a pregame meeting, scored 24 points as Milwaukee beat the Indiana Pacers=20
92-80 Sunday. Bucks coach George Karl kept Robinson, fellow forward Jason=
=20
Caffey and point guard Sam Cassell out of the starting lineup one day after=
=20
criticizing his team for its dismal play in a loss at Atlanta.   Cassell,=
=20
Robinson and Caffey were replaced by Lindsey Hunter, Tim Thomas and Jerome=
=20
Kersey, respectively.   When Robinson entered the game after watching the=
=20
first eight minutes, he missed his first five shots before finding his=20
touch.   =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/03/00=20
 Oakley was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000 by the=
=20
NBA on Friday for punching Los Angeles Clippers guard Jeff McInnis during t=
he=20
morning shootaround.   He sat out Friday night's game against the Clippers,=
=20
and also will miss games in Utah on Tuesday and Portland on Wednesday.    =
=20

 Scott Williams , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Milwaukee Bucks activated Williams from the injured list. Williams wen=
t=20
on the injured list November 17 with lower back spasms. He had been startin=
g=20
at center until his injury but came off the bench Saturday, grabbing four=
=20
rebounds in six scoreless minutes of a 101-94 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. To=
=20
make room for Williams, the Bucks placed rookie guard Michael Redd on the=
=20
injured list.  =20

 Jake Voskuhl , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Chicago Bulls activated Voskuhl on Friday and placed rookie guard A.J.=
=20
Guyton on the injured list with a sprained right knee.   =20

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Minnesota Timberwolves activated Hammonds from the injured list.  =20
Hammonds had been sidelined for the entire season with soreness in both=20
ankles. To make room for Hammonds, the Timberwolves placed forward Reggie=
=20
Slater on the injured list with tendinitis in his right knee.   =20

 Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 MacCulloch was activated Friday by the Philadelphia 76ers and Pepe Sanchez=
=20
was placed on the injured list with bursitis in the left hip.   MacCulloch=
=20
was placed on the injured list Nov. 20 with tendinitis in his left ankle.  =
 =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00=20
 The Cleveland Cavaliers activated Knight from the injured list Friday. The=
=20
point guard had knee surgery Aug. 17. Cleveland also placed guard Michael=
=20
Hawkins on the injured list because of a sprained left ankle.  =20

 Bonzi Wells , G POR - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Wells was suspended for Thursday night's game against Dallas and fined=20
$10,000 by the NBA for intentionally striking and verbally abusing an=20
official.   He will be back in the lineup for Saturday's game at Houston.  =
 =20

 A.J. Guyton , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Guyton sprained his right knee during the first quarter of Thursday night'=
s=20
game against Chicago. He will undergo an MRI on Friday, and will likely mis=
s=20
a few games due to the injury. Guyton is of no value in the world of Fantas=
y.=20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00=20
 Interim head coach Nate McMillan has inserted Davis into the starting line=
up=20
at guard in place of Ruben Patterson.  This move was made more to improve t=
he=20
ballhandling and defense in the backcourt than for offense.  Davis will tak=
e=20
some of the pressure off Gary Payton in running the plays but he won't be o=
f=20
much help to Fantasy teams.   =20

 Vin Baker , F SEA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/01/00=20
 New coach Nate McMillan has made numerous roster changes since taking over=
=20
as interim head coach one of them has involved Baker.  McMillan has replace=
d=20
Baker in the starting lineup with F/C Jelani McCoy.  The move could help to=
=20
motivate Baker in the long run.  He seemed fired up against the Lakers=20
Thursday scoring 20 points and grabbing nine rebounds.  But Baker must stil=
l=20
prove that he can be a consistent producer, put him on your bench until his=
=20
Fantasy production becomes more solid. =20

 Tyronn Lue , G LAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 The Lakers are considering offers for Lue.  He is currently on injured=20
reserve but the Sixers and the Magic have shown interest in him.  Lue could=
=20
develop into a somewhat valuable Fantasy player on either team where he wou=
ld=20
receive extended minutes as a backup.   =20

 Quentin Richardson , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 With Tyrone Nesby traded to Washington.  Richardson moved into the startin=
g=20
lineup at shooting guard Wednesday.  He scored 18 points and grabbed eight=
=20
rebounds.  Keep an eye on Richardson.  If he continues to perform like this=
=20
he will be a nice Fantasy acquisition.  =20

 Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00=20
 Walker has been placed on the injured list due to a sprained left ankle. T=
he=20
ankle could affect Walker's numbers for awhile when he finally does return.=
=20
Although he has been somewhat productive, Walker comes off the bench and is=
=20
only valuable in deeper Fantasy leagues.   =20

sees it this way, but I believe the Chris Warren booting was a real=20
statement  for Smith.? Sure, he still may not  get the 3rd down carries as=
=20
they get a look at Michael Wiley but  Emmitt is pretty much working without=
 a=20
net here.? He proved his mettle once again last  week hammering against a=
=20
tough Tampa team.?  The Cowboys also showed how little faith they have in=
=20
their passing game  as they continued to feed Smith the ball even when=20
trailing badly. Washington  ranks # 21 over the last four weeks in rushing=
=20
yards allowed per  game so they=01,re very beatable.?

Tony  Richardson (KC) vs Panther Defense??  Another week, another RB shakeu=
p=20
in KC as this time it=01,s Kimble Anders  who=01,s out of the mix.? I hones=
tly =20
have a hard time trusting coach Gunther Cunningham with any of them but it=
=20
looks  like Richardson will get the bulk of the work right now.? The Panthe=
rs=20
can be run on.? Keep an eye on the weather in this one  as the passing game=
=20
could be limited.



James Allen  (Chi) vs Patriot Defense?? What a mess Chicago finds itself =
=20
in.? The messiah QB is now healthy  but still on the bench while the =01&gu=
ru=018=20
offensive coordinator has left (been run  out of?) town for Utah and both=
=20
starting WRs are gone for the year with  injuries.? James Allen may be the =
=20
bright spot as he=01,s run hard and effectively.? The New England defense c=

be  vulnerable to the run and this may be another week where they rely on=
=20
Allen to  carry a heavy load.

?

Even Matchups:? These games  feature no real advantage either way?

Edgerrin James (Ind) vs Bills  Defense??  Edgerrin may be  having one of th=
e=20
best =01&poor=018 seasons in NFL history.? He=01,s posting great numbers ov=

he=01,s your guy, you have very little  choice but to start him in the Mond=

Night game.? The Colts are tougher at home and  hopefully they won=01,t fin=

themselves playing catchup again.? Although with his receiving ability,  he=

when his team is playing from behind.?  The Bills rank # 18 over the last=

rushing  defense.?

Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) vs Jets  Defense?? I=01,ll keep an eye on this one fo=

giving him trouble.? Some are  speculating this is the cause of his 2 fumbl=

that could go either way.? I=01,ll try to see what I can find out on  this =
one.?

Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Jaguar  Defense?? The Pittman injury watch=20
continues  as he=01,s still battling turf toe.? He  sat out of practice Thu=
rsday=20
and may not know his status until Friday or  Saturday.? If he can=01,t go, =

lately.?

Lamar Smith (Mia) vs Buccaneer Defense??  Don=01,t let the Buc defense scar=
e=20
you.? They=01,re a very good unit but as Emmitt  Smith proved last week, a=

  not a=20
defense that sends RBs running for cover.? They rank # 17 in rushing yards=

allowed  per game over the last four weeks.?  Martin looked great last week=

and looks to be guy they=01,re counting on to  carry the offense.? =20

?

Eddie George (Ten) vs Bengal  Defense?? Most people have this image in  the=
ir=20
heads of the Bengal defense laying down against the run.? Not so.? Over the=
=20
last four weeks, only 8 teams  are tougher in allowing rushing yards per=20
game.? Maybe that=01,s because teams choose to  pass the ball where Cincinn=

though it=01,s no slam dunk on the matchup.

James Stewart (Det) vs Packer Defense??  Depending on the weather and Charl=

=20
averaging 104 rushing yards allowed per game  over their last 4 which ranks=
=20
them # 14.? =20

??

?

Downside Matchups:? These games favor the  Defense

Brad Hoover (Car)  vs Chief Defense??  With Tshimanga  Biakabutuka revertin=
g=20

career, Hoover gets another shot this week.? The Chiefs are tough at home a=

the  weather could be a factor (possibly in his favor) but Hoover will take=
=20
his power  rushing style into Arrowhead and see how he fares.? Kansas City=

Travis Prentice /  Jamel White (Cle) vs Eagle Defense?? Neither of these gu=

Marshall Faulk  (Stl) vs Viking Defense?? While they=01,re under appreciate=

the Viking rush defense is pretty good.?  Over the last four weeks, they ra=

Marshall Faulk but the defense is one of the tougher one=01,s Faulk will  f=

He=01,s still a no brainer to  start regardless of the opponent.?  He=01,s=
=20
reportedly feeling ok with the knees although he admits to being  worried=
=20
about them both.? Coach Mike  Martz has talked about using him on special=
=20
teams to help turn that unit  around.

J.R. Redmond /  Patrick Pass / Kevin Faulk (NE) vs Bears Defense??  With=20
Redmond still ailing, the Patriot RB situation is a mess.? And Bill Belichi=
ck=20
certainly isn=01,t  shedding much light on anything.?  Unless Redmond shows=
 he=20
can be 100%, I=01,d probably shy away from all 3 of  them as it=01,s too mu=
ch of a=20
shot in the dark trying to predict Belichick.? The Bears are playing pretty=
=20
tough rush  defense with rookie sensation Brian  Urlacher.

Ahman Green (GB)  vs Lion Defense?? One bright spot for the Packers  this=
=20
year has been the outstanding play of Ahman Green.? Coach Mike Holmgren in=
=20
Seattle could  have likely saved a # 1 pick on Alexander if Green was still=
=20
in Seattle.? Green=01,s always had the physical skills  but he lagged behin=
d in=20
other areas.?  Now, he seems to have brought the mental part of the game up=
 =20
significantly and the results are showing on the field.? It=01,s a tough ma=
tchup=20
as the Lions rank #  7 over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed pe=
r=20
game but I think he=01,s up  for it.

??

Defensive Slam Dunks:? These games heavily favor the  Defense

Ricky  Watters (Sea) vs Bronco Defense?? Denver evidently didn=01,t take  k=

as=20
they=01,ve been tough against the run since then.? Over the last four weeks=

? So=20
it=01,s not  like I=01,m terrified of this matchup.?  Just be aware, it=01,=
s a tough=20
one.?  One thing you might want to consider is that coach Mike Holmgren has=
=20
said  at some point, he wants to see more of rookie Shaun Alexander,=20
especially in the  passing game.? How much he=01,d like to  see isn=01,t kn=
own=20
right now.?

Terrell  Fletcher (SD) vs Baltimore Defense??  Let=01,s not go there.? =20
Baltimore is allowing an average of 48 yards rushing per game over their =
=20
last 3 games.? I don=01,t see Fletcher  as the guy who breaks that trend.?

Jerald Moore  / Chad Morton / Terry Allen (NO)? vs  49er Defense??? Early=

this week, both Moore  and Morton were injured and feared to possibly miss=
=20
Sunday=01,s game.? They appear to be healing ahead of  schedule and now it =

last =20
week.? Besides, the 49ers are  deceptively stingy against the rush ranking =
#=20

Corey Dillon  (Cin) vs Titan Defense?? Yes, this is a tough matchup.? But s=

was Denver and the jersey Dillon  wore in that particular tough matchup is=
=20
now hanging in Canton, Ohio.? I learned (and I hope you did too) to go  wit=

Jamal Lewis  (Bal) vs Charger Defense?? Lewis is clearly the class of the =

60,"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

EUROFARE IS BACK! HOPSCOTCH EUROPE FOR ONLY $89 PER FLIGHT
If you want to see city after city in Europe on a cheap buck there is only
one word to say and it=01,s =01&Eurofare.=018  Imagine flying from Paris to=

rate?  All you have to do is purchase a round-trip transatlantic ticket on
Lufthansa or United Airlines from the USA to Europe and then you can
travel to more than 100 cities in 35 countries within Europe for only $89
per flight.  That=01,s right, Lufthansa Airlines=01, Eurofare is back and i=
t=01,s
taking you on a ride to your favorite European cities for only $89 per
flight!

One-way fares from Frankfurt to Rome are as high as $871 and Munich to
Paris currently sells for $345 on a major European Airline. At $89 per
flight for the same cities Eurofare is a great bargain! To qualify book a
roundtrip airline ticket on Lufthansa or United Airlines now through March
30, 2001 and you can add up to six additional flights within Europe for
only $89 per flight.  Your originating transatlantic flight must depart by
March 31, 2001 and your roundtrip travel must be completed by April 7,

65,"Well,

I'm  back.  JRTC was a helluva lot better than I thought it would be.  It
was a month long, and though at times more boring then anything I have ever
experienced in my entire life, I still got to get attacked by an actual
Hind-D helicopter, Soviet BRDM's, suicide squads with backpacks stuffed with
chemical weapons and explosives that charge your tactical operations centers
(TOC) then detonate themselves.

Basically it went like this.

As soon as we got there we started preping for a Light/Heavy Combined Arms
Deliberate Attack Live Fire Exercise.  Basically what this came down to was
we had 155mm and 105mm howitzers, and 81mm mortars with more ammo then you
will ever see in an excercise. Kiowas, M1A2's Bradley's, Tow vehicles,
engineer platoon, and a dismounted platoon.  Our job was to assault through
a bunker complex to set up a support by fire (SBF) posn in order to
facilitate the main efforts assault on the Battalion's (Bn) main obj.

Basically what this boils down to is smash a path from start point to bunker
complex, smash bunker complex, continue smashing path to SBF posn. Once at
SBF posn, smash (put hellacious ammounts of steel on) the Bn  main obj for
15+ minutes to allow a notional Bn Main effort to get up to the obj,
unmolested.

Needles to say it was awesome, I will never see that many assets together,
using that much steel unless some bad guy screws up really really bad
somewhere and we go do it for real,  after experiencing this there is no way
in high holy hell I would ever want to be anywhere near the recieving end of
this hellstorm.  It was my first act out of OBC with my Company and the Live
Fire O/C thought I did well enough to warrant recieving a Division coin,

As far as the actual JRTC rotation went it was pretty boring compared to the
Live Fire.  It was four phases, 1. Entry into the Box (seizing an
airfield/foothold) 2.Low Intensity Conflict (LIC) 3. Attack on
Shugart-Gordon (MOUT stuff) 4. Defense.

The only exciting stuff came in phases 1 and 4 when we actually had heavy
contact.  4 was especially cool cause me and my guys were personally
responsible so much death and pain to enemy dismounts attempting to breach
our obstacles in order to pass their main effort of 60 armored vehicles (30
T-62's, and 30 BRDMs) that the little bastards backed up reconsolidated and
tried again (by this time our plt defending the obstacle was wiped out,)
But guess what, my Forward Observer wasn't with the Platoon but was in an OP
closer to the obstacle,  the bad guys smashed the platoons posn and thought
it was safe to try again on breachin the obstacle.  We called a mass repeat
on the obstacle (60 rounds of 155, 105 and 81mm)  needless to say they got
the hell outta there in a hurry but not without leaving a couple of smoking
vehicle hulls and a mound dead dismounts.  As a result of destroying their
breach effort we turned them back into the Brigades main Engagement Area
where the Armor guys slugged it out with them for awhile.

Anyways,  JRTC was fun,  if you like ur people, any deployment will be fun,
Louisianna was nice, a welcome change to this Island stuff,  plus the
terrain looked just like home.  In fact it was 1 and a half hours away from
your deer camp Bill, I was tempted to just pack it up and take off walkin
and just wait fer opening day.

Well this concludes my post JRTC brief, any quetions?

I spoke w/Fernley Dyson,  CAO for EE and Barry's current boss, and he's 
supportive of Barry's transfer to our region to lead the 
accounting/commercial support efforts for your Tokyo office.  I also spoke 
with Barry, and he's excited as well.  I think it's a done deal.  
Scott/Michael - I told Barry one of you would contact him tomorrow to discuss 
the next steps re: a more standard expat package (not the 6 month situation - 
Causey approved a more standard longer term expat arrangement), and plans to 
move his family to Tokyo.

The issue we need to work out is transition, and I asked Barry to discuss 
that with you directly, Joe, and I told Fernley we'd obviously be flexible 
but we'd like him sooner rather than later.  Barry indicated the guy that 
Fernley just hired that Barry was going to be reporting to is going to start 
towards the end of April.  So I bet they're going to want some overlap there, 
which puts us into end of May before Barry could really move.  I think we 
should be able to accomodate this somewhat longer transition period with 
Heidi's help and with Carol from Houston if necessary, plus I told Barry we'd 
want him to make at least a couple of trips over to Tokyo in the interim so 
he can start getting involved even before he moves over there.  But it will 
be important for us to understand what specifically you want Accounting to 
accomplish by the end of May so Heidi and Carol can plan how to support those 
efforts while not infringing on Heidi's responsibilities and demands in 
Sydney.

Meanwhile, I've asked HR to contact Eugenio Perez, Sally's designee for the 
temporary Risk position, to begin those discussions, and Sally said she could 
address transition issues for him next week - she'll be in London 
(Scott/Michael - you should probably give her a call in the London office 
their Monday afternoon).  Perhaps we can get Eugenio over to Tokyo earlier 
than Barry.

at the July 19 BIC meeting. All these changes were made as result of ICAP
Working Group deliberations over the past two weeks. They are summarized
here:

> Section 4.4.11 - This new sub-section addresses Generators that
> temporarily may not wish to sell or certify their UCAP.  Without this
> language,  those Generators would have been considered forced out.
>
> Section 4.6 - The second paragraph is new and clarifies the result of
> outages which occur beyond the step-up transformer, and including such
> step-up transformer.  If these outages occur at a time when a Generator
> has not placed its unit on a maintenance outage, such interruption in
> availability shall be treated as a reserve shutdown for purposes of
> calculating that Generator's EFORD.
>
> Section 5.5 - Language describing the roll-over characteristics of UCAP
> bids from the first phase of an auction to the second phase of that same
> auction has been struck because the ICAPWG deemed it confusing.

the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta. 1-4.  Understand 
these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to 
emit.  When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required, 
so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA 
approved document.  This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers 
presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net 
more emissions, if needed.  Emissions are presented for a single engine only 
in tons per year, even though there are two auxillary units at each facility

139,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=

GISB IS NOW NAESB
GISB is now officially NAESB.  (The actual pronunciation is still undetermined!!!)  I may unintentionally go back and forth between the names -- my apologies in advance.  Also, some things are still officially 'GISB', such as the operating practices.  There is still transition work to be done.  At times it's a bit confusing and has already come up during a subcommittee meeting.  I'm working to keep up with everything in NAESB, at least for a while, to watch for things that affect our quadrant and our processes.
AGA is hosting two meetings in January in Washington, D.C. to discuss the retail gas and retail electric quadrants.
Numerous meetings are being held by organizations such as NERC.  These are being held in response to the FERC order issued December 19 (RM01-12), which addresses standards development for the wholesale electric industry.  If the industry does not agree on a single standards development organization for wholesale electric standards by March 15, 2002, the FERC will either choose one or develop the standards themselves.

GISB (NAESB) UPDATE MEETINGS
Due to current events at Enron and then the holidays, I haven't held these meetings on a regular basis.  I'm working on a regular schedule of meetings.  People have said they want these to continue and prefer them to written updates.  They want to know what's going on in GISB, including what's happening with NAESB.

NOPR ON GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS
I'll work with Nancy Bagot on our comments (due February 1).
The El Paso pipelines will probably comment on standard 5.3.2 (the FERC asked for comments on whether they should adopt GISB's revisions).  They will also get with INGAA to begin coordination of INGAA's comments.
I'll let you know what I hear from other pipelines or other companies.

GISB VERSION 1.5
Assuming the FERC adopts the version 1.5 standards, the implementation date for the title transfer tracking (TTT) standards is April 18, 2002.  I'll work with the pipelines to ensure we're ready.  As I recall, we've been in compliance with the proposed standards for a while.  It would be a good idea to double check.
The implementation date for the remainder of the standards could be as early as June 1, 2002.
I'm working to determine the best way to update our copy of the version 1.5 standards to incorporate the corrections noted in the errata.  It is very unlikely that GISB will correct the standards books.  Other than the pipelines, none of the EC representatives have voiced a concern or an interest in having the books corrected.  It will be difficult for our people (business and technical) to use separate documents (the standards books and the errata) when implementing.  And, it will create greater opportunities for error.

TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING
I'm working with the IR chairs to finalize the data sets.  Next, Technical will develop code values to be used on our Web sites.  The data sets will then be sent to the EC for vote (EBB implementation only at this time) and will probably be included in version 1.6, scheduled for publication on July 31, 2002.  Technical will develop the EDI implementation guides, which will be part of a later publication.

INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
ENA has said that they will not continue to chair IR.  They may try to participate.  This leaves IR with only one chair.  Dale Davis and I are filling in the gap.  I'm not chairing any meetings -- I'm only helping outside the meetings.  We have a candidate in mind for IR chair and we're working to bring him up to speed as quickly as possible.  The current chair still is not working out, but the new chair should be able to handle the position and run IR.  The better job the IR chairs do, the less I have to do.
We are also working on a few of IR's processes.  This will help to avoid another errata situation like the one we have with version 1.5.  The more complete IR's work product is, the less the NAESB office has to handle it and, therefore, the less they can mess it up.

GISB PUBLICATION PROCESS
The task force that is working on the publication process (PPRTF) is picking up speed again (after the holidays).  This group is addressing not only the publication process, but also the approval process for standards.  We meet via conference call every Tuesday and Friday for 1/2 day.  Our work product is due to the EC in time for their February 2002 meeting.  As with IR, the results should help avoid another massive errata, as we have for version 1.5.

The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
 
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 18 , 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
 
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.  
 
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
 
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

2ND ANNUAL 
FUELCELL 
INVESTOR
 A Unique Networking Opportunity To Talk Directly To CEOs Of Virtually All Publicly Traded FC Companies And Other Executives Whose Decisions Can Change The Future Of The Industry!
March 26 - 27, 2002 w The Roosevelt Hotel w New York, NY

The rapidly expanding fuel industry was recently given yet another boost, as the Bush administration last week abandoned a multi-billion dollar, eight-year project to develop high-mileage gasoline-fueled vehicles and instead is throwing its support behind a plan to develop hydrogen-based fuel cells to power the cars of the future.


With the highest possible level of speakers in the fuel cell industry, this summit offers unparallel networking potential. Some major blue chip companies will be presenting, among them Air Products, Dupont, GE Equity, General Motors, Ford and Morgan Stanley.



This event will be a unique opportunity to hear from and talk directly to CEOs of virtually all publicly traded FC companies: Walter (Chip) Schroeder, Proton Energy; H. Frank Gibbard, H Power; Jerry D. Leitman, FuelCell Energy; Bill Acker, Mechanical Technology; Stephen S. Tang, Millennium Cell; Pierre Rivard, Hydrogenics; Robert K. Lifton, Medis Technology; John Donohue, DCH Technology, plus CFOs and Directors of several more fuel cell companies, including Plug Power, Ceramic Fuel Cells and many others.

183,"Hi! I hope you enjoyed the rest of your weekend. The weather was simply
beautiful. We did some extensive yardwork. Luckily we didn't plant much
since it is supposed to be chilly this week.

Brianna and I loved the sing-a-long Sound of Music. It was great fun. I'd go
again next weekend!

Let me know which day is best for us to have lunch --Wednesday or Thursday.

Shelley and Steve,

As you know, we have been working with facilities to develop options to replace or improve our 75KVA UPS that provides power to the Gas Control environment. My recommendation at this time is that we stand pat with the current 75KVA UPS and the redundancy that we currently have in place. Given the uncertainties of the status and ownership of the 40KVA UPS on EB44, and given Mr. Cooper's stated intention of moving out of this building, it simply doesn't make sense to spend the $28K estimated to leverage the 40KVA UPS on EB44. I've talked with Randy Lord and he is comfortable with us continuing to rely on the 75KVA unit for the near term. 

I do want to thank facilities for their efforts, particularly Charles Upshaw, who provided a great deal of assistance in reviewing what equipment was available and how we might leverage the equipment.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Gary

I'm not sure if you are the person I need to be contacting, so if you're not 
maybe you can lead me in the right direction.

I am in the process of working on a gas well in Hodgeman County, Kansas;
Section 18, T21S, R22W.  The BTU test for a well in the vicinity came back 
at 723BTU.  699.25 Methane, 14.64 Ethane, 4.77 Propane, 1.3 Isobutane, 0.98 
Normal Butane, 0.4 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 1.51 Hexanes.  Mole % is 
69.45 Methane, 0.83 Ethane, 0.19 Propane, 0.04 Isobutane, 0.03 Normal 
Butane, 0.01 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 0.03 Hexanes, 28.45 Nitrogen, 
0.04 Oxygen, 0 Carbon Dioxide, 0.93 Helium, and 0 Hydrogen.

Do you have a pipeline in the vicinity, and would you be able to purchase or 
transport the forementioned quality of gas.

If you could inform me on pipelines who could service this well please send 
me an e-mail.

Thank you.

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed.

198,"Hello to each of you!

As you've heard from Paul, I'm going to be working with your team to devise 
some very specific and concrete strategies to enhance the way you, both 
individually and as a group of co-workers, contribute to achieving the 
business goals established for your office.  

I'm going to be on your conference call this coming Thursday to give you an 
overview of the process Paul and I have discussed. I'll try to answer 
questions and give you as much insight and ""comfort"" as I can. I know it's a 
bit awkward working on an effort such as this with someone you've never laid 
eyes on. It was for that reason I was hoping that I'd be able join your staff 
meeting in person this week and meet you ""face-to-face"" but the stars didn't 
align quite right so that's just going to have to wait a few weeks. The 
trusty e-mail system and the telephone will just have to suffice for our 
initial work together!

The first part of this process is to get some ""base line"" data so that there 
is a sort of ""level playing field"" of information that we're working with. 
Recognizing that you're already deluged with surveys and assessments, it is 
only after great consideration that I'm asking you to complete the one that's 
attached to this note! Frankly, there's just no easy way to get this initial 
perspective so I hope you'll understand. 

Here's what I'd like you to do: 
 - Complete the assessment - it's only 25 items in length and all are pretty 
straightforward.
 - Print off a hard copy and hold on to the assessment! Just keep it with you.
 - When we ""talk"" on the conference call this Thursday, 4/13, be prepared to 
work with me on setting-up
    a time for you and me to have about 45 minutes or an hour to go over your 
responses in some detail - on the      telephone, unfortunately.   

I'll write this to you now and will say it to you in the future -  everything 
we discuss is strictly confidential. My interest is only in establishing some 
understanding of the work climate within your team. 

After I've gathered the assessment and discussion information and have had a 
chance to review and digest it, I'll be coming out to your fair city for an 
""off-site"" workshop. I'll tell you more about that on Thursday in addition to 
setting some dates on which to hold the workshop that will work for all of 
you (I know that's going to be the challenge!) 

One final word (or two): My intention in this work with you and your team 
will be strictly focused on the ""here and now"" and on what future, specific 
action items we can identify and implement that will enhance your individual 
and team performance to produce the desired business results.    

Talk with you on Thursday and I'm looking forward to working with you. 

Best Regards,

Don Miller

199,"Jeff is correct that AB 1890 said NOTHING about direct access credits, said
nothing about whether such credits were to be market based, or whether
direct access customers were to be indifferent to their choice of power
providers.  All of the direct access credit rules were developed by the CPUC
in their approval of the direct access tariff rules (Rule 22) and in their
implementation of the utility cost recovery plans (the calculation of CTC).
Therefore, we cannot protest the PE advice letter on that basis.  We can
still argue for the DJ indexes as a more appropriate substitute for a PE
credit based just on Edison's cost of generation (retained generation plus
QFs plus DWR purchases) but we have to recognize that it the number is
higher than the PE credit, we will be effectively asking for a subsidy to
direct access providers from the utility's bundled customers.  I do not
expect us to succeed in obtaining that subsidy.  The bottom up tariff
structure is a much more likely result at this point.  Mike Day

when he was CFO of PG&E and I was a bureaucrat at the PUC working on the Blue

was very positive about the comprehensive solution that Ken Lay described to 
Glynn at this morning's meeting.  He was particularly positive about the 
core/noncore proposal.  He asked to meet to discuss it further.  I have an 
appointment to meet with him Monday afternoon.  He offered--as a board member 
of the California Chamber of Commerce--to help bring the Chamber along, and 
he also said that he can help with the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Ass.  
I'll report back after the meeting.

And may have already mentioned that I have a meeting scheduled in Sacramento 
Monday with the CEO of the Chamber and the President of CMA.

Will report back on the meetings.  Have a good weekend.

Power Drain: The U.S. Energy Crisis

No Score in California Blame Game: Probes 
Find Little Proof Power Companies Colluded

By JOHN R. EMSHWILLER 
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL


LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on, but one 
thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an 
electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing.

In recent days, top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric 
against a handful of merchant power companies, many of them Texas-based, that 
supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such 
as Reliant Energy Inc., of Houston, have engaged in ""unconscionable 
price-gouging."" Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities 
Commission and a Davis appointee, proclaims that a ""cartel"" of electricity 
producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is 
backing a bill that would make energy price-fixing a felony, and as a private 
citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court.

Investigations Under Way

About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging 
from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's 
office. So far, these probes -- some of which have been under way for months 
-- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges.

While the energy suppliers are generating ""unconscionable profits,"" the 
question remains ""whether they are illegal profits,"" says California Attorney 
General Bill Lockyer, who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of 
millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business.

Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges 
against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. ""I would 
love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 
cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says 'Hi my name is Spike, 
honey,' "" adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading 
company. Like other such firms, Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California 
market.

Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for corporate communications, said Mr. 
Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay "" is so counterproductive that it doesn't 
merit a response.""

Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual 
firms have been exercising ""market power."" This term is used to denote 
efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices, such as by withholding 
supplies. The California Independent System Operator, or ISO, which manages 
the state's electric transmission grid, estimates that by exercising market 
power, suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity 
in the state since early last year.

A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal, says Severin 
Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a 
company is a large supplier in the state and ""you're not exercising market 
power, you are not doing your job"" on behalf of shareholders, he says.

Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken 
against suppliers. They note that under federal power law, the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above 
""just and reasonable"" levels. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered California 
suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds, as part of 
that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the 
suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars.

The power industry, not surprisingly, says there is nothing to accusations of 
price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched 
state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market 
purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade, California didn't build 
enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of 
manipulation are ""a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything,"" 
says Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an 
industry trade group.

Tim, I know Jeff knows all about the conference we are organizing and I hope
you do as well.

Rob, I and the rest of the conference organizers are wondering if you could
help us find out if Jeff Skilling from Enron would be willing to be one of
our panelists? He has been an articulate critic of the current state of our
electricity markets, and we definitely would like the genco perspective
represented.

Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity about
the conference will be going out shortly.

A brief description of the conference is appended below. Please let me know
if you need any additional information.

Thanks very much for your help and advice.
Lee

The summer of San Diego has prompted the School, in collaboration with UC's
Energy Institute and Competition Policy Center, to sponsor a high-level
summit conference on electricity deregulation. The focus, and the audience,
will be national, but heavily informed and influenced by the California
crisis.  The conference will evaluate (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2)
how the pitfalls encountered so far can be avoided and remedied. The
University will facilitate an open, honest and reasoned exchange between
executive-level players from various perspectives: industry, regulators,
consumers, legislators, academics, and market and system operators.

The format entails two roundtable discussions with six speakers and a
moderator.  During the panel sessions, the speakers will engage in a
debate/dialogue on the current situation in electricity deregulation, where
we have come from, what the future holds, and what solutions lie on the
horizon. Each speaker will have uninterrupted time to speak, followed by Q&A
and discussion.  We expect a live audience of about 200, including a large
press presence.  One sponsor has tentatively offered to provide internet
streaming video services.  We hope to have a balanced group of sponsors
ranging from the American Public Power Association to energy companies.

The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have commitments from:
Loretta Lynch (Chair, CPUC), and PJM CEO Phil Harris. We have a preliminary
acceptance from Steven Littlechild (England's former primary electricity
regulator) and Laura Tyson (former Chair, President's Council of Economic
Advisors and National Economic Council, currently Dean, Haas School of
Business). We have invited FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, and U.S.
Representative Edward
Markey, executive-level managers from several energy companies and state
legislators. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of the
panels, as will economist Severin Borenstein, Director of UCEI and Professor
of Business and Public Policy. Michael Florio from The Utility Reform
Network (TURN) will be a consumer advocate on one of the panels. Lee
Friedman, economist and Professor of Public Policy, will briefly provide an
introduction to the panel discussions with his talk ""Lighting the Stage: The
Electricity of Deregulation.""

A dinner for the panelists and organizers will be hosted at UC's Goldman
School of Public Policy following the conference proceedings. We have
reserved rooms for our speakers at Berkeley's landmark Claremont Hotel. We
can reimburse those speakers who request it for coach airfare expenses and
other ordinary local expenses.

group to try to politically exploit the situation out there to weaken Davis

companies who have been on the other end of the Governor's attacks. A friend

Per CPUC Rule 51

Gas Accord II Settlement Participants:


Attached is PG&E's Gas Accord II (GA II) Settlement Proposal.  We believe it
addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops.


As an overview, this proposal:

* Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the
period 2003 to 2007.
*
* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most
customers than rates in effect today.
*
* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers.
*
* Offers a 7.5 cent/dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate
changes to other customers, minimizing the incentive for these customers to
seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC-approved charges.
*
* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in
gas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet
these guidelines over the course of the GA II period (2003-2007).
*
* Provides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5% escalator to
capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects.  The
guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost
of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or
catastrophic events.
*
* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths,
although somewhat less than the current differential.
*
* Proposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services
beginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available
capacity.
*
* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.

PG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism (CPIM)
will be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger
capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to
meet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event.

This also will serve as a reminder that an all-Party meeting is scheduled at
PG&E's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11, to discuss this
proposal and to respond to your questions.  We look forward to answering
your questions and receiving your feedback.

The attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal, an Attachment
(a copy of PG&E's proposed Gas Rule 27), and a set of supporting workpapers.

Finally, please note that the Settlement document and the Attachment are in
""Word 2000"" format.  We would be glad to provide the same documents in an
earlier version of Word, upon request by individual Parties.

We look forward to seeing you on January 10-11.  In the meantime, we extend
our best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season.

Letter requests that the CPUC value hydro at $2.8 billion versus $1 billion 
effective June 28, 2000.  We are concerned that the purpose of this maneuver 
is so that PG&E can claim the rate freeze had ended at the end of June and 
that they can pass on the high cost of energy beginning July to retail 
customers versus incurring the shareholder risks. I'm almost surprised PG&E 
didn't claim the value effective June 12 -- the day before the high prices 
began.  This is disgusting.  PG&E has absolutely no shame!  We'll be making

227,"Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which 
does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this 
is a venture we should support.  In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in 
seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation 
company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 
2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.  These units are fully mobile via 
the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current 
SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency 
power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable.  
The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets 
that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and 
constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.  

The benefits include:
 a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the 
opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the 
possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, 
Capstone and Elektryon;
 b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe 
that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize 
this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer 
applications;
 c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of 
critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.  If ENA through this 
venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in 
our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk;
 d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital 
would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology 
did not work or the market did not materialize;
 e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology;
 and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.

However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other 
Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company 
and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the 
technology proves out.  Given, that we could benefit most from the successful 
application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.

Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.  We have a 
very solid history with this company.  They have successfully solved many of 
the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently 
operating at New Albany.  They would bring the technical and engineering 
expertise at cost for their 50%.  ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause 
at a fixed number for their 50% .

If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I 
will set up a meeting.

1. All D&O policies are written on a ""claims made basis"".    As noted in my 
earlier comments, I find no ""retroactive date"" in the policy.  If i2 renews 
with different   underwriters, the ""retroactive date""  should remain the 
same.  If renewal is with the same underwriters, the date normally stays the 
same.  If they decide not to renew for whatever reason, they should, at a 
minimum, provide a runoff period or ""tail"" for the reporting of claims as a 
result of wrongful acts committed while the coverage was in effect.  I will 
leave the ""contractual commitment to renew"" to Mr. Lay and his attorneys.

2. As mentioned in my voice mail, the carriers are acceptable security.  We 
were not provided enough information on i2 to comment on the adequacy of the 
limit.  (We did note that Enron's program could apply as excess insurance if 
Mr. Lay is serving at the request of Enron.)

3. The indemnity provided by an organisation to their D's and O's is normally 
found in the Company by-laws.  If sued, the director or officer would first 
seek protection from the Company's indemnity.  If the indemnity does not 
respond, the claim is made directly against the insurance subject to the 
policy terms and conditions.  Most D&O matters are covered by the company's  
indemnity and the claim is subject to the deductible under the Corporate 
reimbursement section of the  D&O policy.  Normally the ""direct coverage"" has 
no deductible. 

4. The contractual matter should be handled by counsel.

5. It is normal in this type policy for the application to form a part of the 
policy.  ""Polling""  the D's and O's at renewal will at least ensure that all 
claims are reported.  

6. See comment #1 above.

7. Employees are covered only when they are sued along with a director or 
officer, except for the  Employment Practices Coverage, where employees are 
covered along with directors and officers.

Please call if you or Mr. Baird wish to discuss further.

232,"Jim:
Here are our comments on the i2 Technologies insurance policy.  This is a
combination of my comments and Marcia Backus' comments, and in fact Marcia
gets the vast bulk of the credit (I found out that she has considerable
experience in this area).
(1)  This is a claims made policy.  Apparently they are all this way.
Ken should get a contractual commitment from the Company to renew the
coverage upon its expiration or obtain new coverage that covers claims made
after expiration of the policy but relating to periods when Ken served on
the board.
(2)  We didn't attempt to determine whether the amounts of coverage are
adequate in light of the company's business or whether the carriers are
solid; I suspect Jim Bouillion has far more expertise on those issues than
we do.
(3) See item E on page 23 of 26.  It appears that the effect of the
language is that the $150,000 deductible applies if there's any case where
the Company is required or permitted by law to indemnify Ken but for some
reason (other than insolvency) it does not indemnify Ken.  This appears to
be a provision designed by the insurance company to ensure that the Company
doesn't say to Ken ""Hey, you'll be fine and we'll come out ahead if you
agree that we won't indemnify you; you can just collect from the insurance
company with no deductible, and we'll be better off because if we indemnify
you we'll have a deductible.""  This provision may make sense from an
insurance policy standpoint, but Ken ought to make sure he has a contractual
commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted
by law.
(4)  Please note exclusion 19 on page 22 of 26.  This provision is
designed to protect the insurance company by preventing the company from
making money by suing a director and then letting the director collect from
the insurance company.  Again, this points up that Ken needs a contractual
commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted
by law.
(5)  The application for the policy is part of the policy, which
apparently means that if there was something wrong with the application the
policy itself may be void, not only against the Company that applied for the
policy but also against innocent insureds such as Ken.
(6) The policy confers on the parent company the authority to cancel the
policy on behalf of the beneficiaries at any time.  Ken should get a
contractual commitment from the Company not to cancel the policy without
obtaining substitute coverage that is at least as good.
(7)   The policy provides insurance for employees as well as officers and
directors, which dilutes the coverage somewhat.
Generally, this appears to us to be an ok policy.  I would be very
interested in knowing whether Jim Bouillion disagrees with that assessment.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.

Please be sure that your desk is completely cleaned out and that there is NOTHING left in your area._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now. I am asking You to minister to their spirit
at this very moment.

Where there is pain, give them Your peace and mercy.

Where there is self doubting, release a renewed
confidence in Your ability to work through them.

Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, I ask You to
give them understanding, patience, and strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.

Where there is spiritual stagnation, I ask You to
renew them by revealing Your nearness, and by drawing
them into greater intimacy with You.

Where there is fear, reveal Your love, and release to
them Your courage. Where there is a sin blocking them,reveal it, and
break
its hold over my friend's life.

Bless their finances, give them greater vision, and
raise up leaders, and friends to support, and
encourage them. Give each of them discernment to
recognize the evil forces around them, and reveal to
them the power they have in You to defeat it.

I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In love, Your Friend

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something Christ would do.

With Natural Gas prices being sustained at levels never before seen, the
publishing of NGW's Daily Price Snapshot: The Natural Gas Market Outlook:
Winter 2000-01 could not come at a better time.

The Natural Gas Market Outlook: Winter 2000-01, written by the staff of

Natural Gas Market Outlook: Winter 2000-2001 focuses on issues and market
factors that could play a role in the gas industry's performance during its
highest demand season, and one that is predicted to be a stern test for the

Attached are draft transaction agreements for the on and off peak periods for 
the months
of November and December.  Regarding the side letter agreement which 
addresses the
end of the quarter true-up calculation for negative monthly revenue sharing 
amounts, it is
Enron's desire to include this calculation in these transaction agreements.  
We propose
the language as shown in the attached transaction agreements.  It will permit 
that the 
true-up calculation will occur whether or not the December Off Peak 
Transaction is done.

Please call me if you have any other comments and changes at 713-853-1667.

However, the same correlation structure with similar periodicity may not hold

386,"I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to 
curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in 
April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at 
construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or 
SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of 
the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked 
about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been 
around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John 
Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at 
least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to 
understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday 
during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX 
component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could 
then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors 
(e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

I agree with you that we need to run AT LEAST 500 iterations.  But I did not
realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations. Helen and I talked 
earlier about
using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts 
and
run the parts separately on different processors, then aggregate the results.
This procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time. Looks like
we have to do it this way now.  Buying a more powerful computer helps but 
does not solve the problem. 

In addition, we might want to re-consider if writing the code in VB is 
optimal.
I was assured at the very beginning that VB runs as fast (if not faster) as C,
but some re-assurance from IT group on this issue is helpful.

Today's focus: Novell to release security flaw details

By Jason Meserve

Novell has sent out a warning to GroupWise users that it will
soon be unveiling details of the security flaw in its Padlock
product. Back in August, the company announced that it had
discovered a problem in the application and issued a patch.

The company says 85% of its customers have downloaded the patch
and is urging the rest to do so before Nov. 23, when it details
what the flaw entails. The remaining 15% of users can download
the appropriate patch from:
http://support.novell.com/padlock

Novell claims none of its customers have reported any security
breaches as a result of this flaw.

The announcement comes as Microsoft's Security Response Center
published a column about how vulnerability information is
shared and what should be done to change the current system.
It's an interesting read:

the disease anthrax, has appeared on the Internet but is being
hampered because of a flaw in its design, antivirus companies
said Wednesday.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/1017anthrax.html
IDG News Service, 10/17/01

* WM97/Myna-AZ - This is one of those Word macro viruses with
no malicious payload. (Sophos)

* Dark Machine - A self-propagating worm that spreads via e-
mail. It comes in a message with varying subject lines and body
text that reads, ""heh.  I tell ya this is nuts!  You gotta
check it out!"" Attachment names include Si.exe, UserConf.exe,
Disk.exe, Rede.exe and Common.exe. (SecureWorks)


>From the interesting reading department:


* It's time to end information anarchy

It's high time the security community stopped providing
blueprints for building these weapons. And it's high time
computer users insisted that the security community live up to
its obligation to protect them. We can and should discuss
security vulnerabilities, but we should be smart, prudent and
responsible in the way we do it.

network administrators to secure wireless networks, showing how
hackers can use traditional methods to attack otherwise secure
fixed networks from a wireless entry point.

* Opinion: Don't be lulled by firewalls

The recent Nimda virus caused untold damage to companies
throughout the world. IT administrators spent days disinfecting
and patching infected systems, as well as belatedly applying
current security patches to systems running Microsoft's
Internet Information Server software. Nimda did an incredibly
thorough job of finding systems running IIS, even if those
systems weren't really Web servers.

10/23/01 - Today's focus: NetScout's nGenius

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

* NetScout's nGenius admin toolset is comprehensive, but slow
  and expensive
* Links related to Network World product reviews
* Featured reader resource

Today's focus: NetScout's nGenius

By Neal Weinberg

The Reviewmeister is all for any tool that can automate
repetitive network administrative tasks, so we checked out
nGenius by NetScout Systems.

The nGenius suite, which NetScout obtained when it acquired
NextPoint Networks last year, contains Real Time Monitor Plus
1.2, Application Service Level Manager 3.0 and Capacity Planner
3.0. To the NextPoint software, NetScout added a number of
enhancements and additions, including its WebCast technology
for rendering reports using a Web-based newspaper publishing
metaphor.

We found nGenius' network monitoring to be accurate and
comprehensive, the reports thoughtfully designed and the
documentation especially clear and comprehensive. However, we
found the Java-based nGenius software slow and cumbersome. We
would have liked a greater degree of integration among the
nGenius components, and we feel the $150,000 price tag for the
three tools makes the software far too expensive.

Real Time Monitor Plus impressed us with its accurate
monitoring, analyzing and reporting of network traffic. In
particular, its troubleshooting features helped us isolate the
causes of the network problems we gave it to handle.

Real Time Monitor Plus consists of nGenius Server, Traffic
Monitor, Performance Monitor and Packet Analyzer. The nGenius
Server sorts, stores and analyzes packets from NetScout probes,
routers and switches, and it has a user interface for managing
network devices and identifying people authorized to access
nGenius. Traffic Monitor displays real-time network activity at
configurable intervals (from 15 seconds to 15 minutes), while
Performance Monitor and Packet Analyzer examine network
activity to pinpoint bandwidth bottlenecks and categorize the
kinds of traffic causing network problems.

Application Service Level Manager ferrets out application
traffic jams by studying an application's Open Database
Connectivity packets, TCP socket usage or HTML emissions. Once
we defined our test application's minimum service levels in
these terms, Application Service Level Manager alerted us to
service-level exceptions by paging us, sending e-mail and
transmitting SNMP traps.

We used Capacity Planner to discover our network's devices,
collect network utilization data from those devices and report
the results. It gave us useful browser-based reports showing
historical data, baseline data and trends in an easy-to-
understand newspaper-like format. We found customizing the
various Capacity Planner reports via the NewsEditor module to
be straightforward. Similarly, setting up threshold filters to
define exceptions we wanted nGenius to monitor was an easy
task.

The Java and database run-time environment NetScout ships with
the nGenius suite which consists of JRun 3.01, from Allaire
(now part of Macromedia), and an Oracle database, Version
8.0.4.4. JRun is a Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) application
server.

 The nGenius suite runs on Windows NT, Windows 2000 and
Solaris, and its three-tier architecture makes it possible to
distribute nGenius components across multiple computers.
Unfortunately, even when spread across different computers, the
nGenius server, Traffic Monitor and Capacity Planner components
weren't as responsive in our tests as we would have liked.

Installing the nGenius components takes several steps, with
server reboots required between steps. The tedious installation
is further complicated by the software's exacting platform
requirements. Windows NT, for instance, must be version 4.0
with Service Pack 6a, have Internet Explorer 5.0 with Java
Virtual Machine 5.0.0.3190 and run on at least a dual-processor
750-MHz Intel computer with 1G byte of memory, a 1,024-by-768-
pixel color monitor set for 32,768 colors and 26G bytes of disk
storage.

NGenius excels at monitoring, analyzing and reporting on
network utilization in an enterprise setting. Still, we'll hold
off on recommending nGenius until it gets a bit faster and
carries a smaller price tag.

First let me say thank you for your assistance in making it possible for 
meteorologists Tony Hamilton and Stephen Bennett to hit the groung running 
this week when they came over to London from Houston.  When we came into our 
offices in Houston Monday morning, Tony and Steve had already gathered and 
analyzed their data, prepared reports and were ready for the Avistar 
briefings! The cross-Atlantic communication and data-sharing and manipulation 
went seamlessly!  We have great expectations for continued synergy with this 
new set-up.

The Research Weather Group is excited about our expanded responsibilities in 
London. We are committed to maximizing the value added we can provide to the 
Weather Derivatives, Crude & Products, UK Trading, Continental Power, and 
Analytics efforts.  We are, however,  also extremely dependent on computers 
and communication, associated software and peripherals.  Plus the datastreams 
we access and the reports we generate are very time-critical in their value 
to traders.  We need a very stable environment, with reliable back-up and 
24-hour support to fulfill our commitments to providing the trading operation 
with timely, never-fail research and information flows.

So, thanks again, and  please do whatever you can to continue this high level 
of support by passing this letter of praise and thanks to your team, and show 
them our appreciation for your efforts.

I like modeling and I think I can do well from the very beginning.  Let me know what you think about it.

                  sectors of the U.S. bond market. S&P Credit Indices are quoted in basis
                  points over the U.S. Treasury yield curve once daily. 

                  Credit spread movements within the investment grade spectrum are
                  represented in the S&P U.S. Industrial Investment Grade Credit Index while
                  movements within the speculative grade rating spectrum are captured in the
                  S&P U.S. Industrial Speculative Grade Credit Index. 

                  Each credit index represents the distribution of U.S. corporate issues across
                  different rating categories and subsectors. Re-balancing occurs regularly to
                  ensure that the indices are composed of relevant issues with sufficient
                  liquidity. Pricing information for the S&P Credit Indices' underlying securities
                  is derived from a number of sources. 

                  Option adjusted spreads (OAS) are used as a proxy for nominal credit
                  spreads in order to adjust for the presence of embedded options. Standard &
                  Poor's utilizes the proprietary option adjusted spread model developed by
                  Andrew Kalotay Associates, Inc.

Although I agree that any price cap has a ""discouraging "" impact on the

To the point, without a creative exit strategy, I would not waste development 
money on a 10000-13000 BTU/KWh heat rate peaking project.  However, even with 
the FERC order, I will continue to spend money developing base load, 7000

450,"Summary of what we discussed the other night:

Background:


power -- power prices have moved above $1000/mwh in the Northwest and are 
showing $600-700 for the first quarter of 01; forward prices in California 
have also moved well above the ""soft cap"" of $150.  Sellers are exporting 
power from California to the Northwest.

gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan 
trading at $19, feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8.

The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for 
retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while 
gas utilities, we believe, are primarily buying at spot prices even under 
their long term deals).  The power utilities will continue to book large 
deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two 
after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin 
showing up in Jan billings to consumers.

curtailment rules (gas):  More work to be done here, but it appears that gas 
utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order:  interruptible 
first (with some priority for cogens); firm service (with utilities 
alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load); and 
core customers last.  Curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to 
confiscate gas sold to direct access customers",,above $1000/mwh 600 150 26 19 12 8,ISO

452,"Below is a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor 
Davis on 2/9/01.  

For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version:

These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things:

1.  Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of 
Existing Powerplants
2.  Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities
3.  Centralize Authority and/or Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting 
and Construction

The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting 
powerplants; and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full 
capacity.  (ie; the carrot and the stick)

They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators 
to sell their power under contract to the State Dept. of Water.

Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will 
be:

- How much capacity is truly ""idling"" and will be able to be brought back on 
line or increase its output?
- Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create 
flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to 
positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction 
and operation?
- How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and 
how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given 
the other issues in CA?

We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders, but wanted to get 
information to you in a timely manner.

D-22-01  Increased Output/Expedited Siting Mandates 
  
CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power 
generators. 
- limited to less than 50MWs using existing installed capacity b/w 
06/01-10/01/01 

Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal 
powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate.

Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed 
thermal powerplants.

Action by the State Water Resources Control Board  to insure wastewater 
issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating.

Requirements for the State Dept. of Water Resources to purchase power from 
powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not 
other market for their power.

Expires  12/31/01 unless extended

Analysis:

This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are 
currently not operating or not operating at full capacity.  It does not waive 
air quality requirements (they are addressed in a separate order).  

D-23-01  Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements

ISO Requirements:
- Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO
- Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly
- Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities
- Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide 
those records to Electricity Oversight Board
- Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below 
performance benchmarks est. by the ISO
- Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to 
impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities 
have fallen     below performance benchmarks est. by the ISO

Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and 
Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISO's ability 
to ensure adequate power during peak demand.

Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by 
utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability.

Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its 
authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est. 
benchmarks for availability and performance, and issue fines against those 
plants, after a hearing.

Analysis:

Again, the tone of this order is that the state won't tolerate outages as an 
excuse for not generating.  It is also an attempt to better manage planned 
outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants 
where off-line for maintenance at the same time.

D-24-01  Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures

Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of 
operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities 
that provide power under contract to the Dept. of Water Resources are not 
restricted in their ability to operate.
- Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable 
emissions in excess of the previous limits
- If air districts do not comply, the Board (CARB?) shall impose 
modifications on the permits in lieu of districts

The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions 
reductions from all available sources:
- Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need 
emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the 
Summer Peak Season in 2001
- In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to 
the Dept. of Water Resources, CA will make available where necessary and 
available the required emissions credits at up to a 50 percent reduction,
- In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity, 
emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to 
facilities where necessary and available.
- Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made 
available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the 
new or expanded facility is located.

Expires 12/31/2001 unless extended

Analysis:

This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours 
for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept. 
of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit 
bank available for use by other sources.  There are a lot of details that 
remain to be clarified, including how the state is going to locate emissions 
reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful.  However, it is a step 
in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive 
authority back to the state level.

D-25-01  Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants

Expedites review and approval of post-certification amendments to increase 
output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission.

Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes 
and regulations that normally control post-certifications to the extent that 
they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency.

Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of 
construction within one year of certification, and for the construction phase 
of the project.  Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy 
Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of 
the certification.

Expires 12/31/01 unless extended

Analysis

Again, no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and 
completed in a timely manner.

D-26-01  Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources

Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to 7 days for 
required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all 
powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission (under 50MWs) and 
that are proposed to be on line by summer 2001.

 Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways:
- Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants 
for construction and operation by July 31, 2001.
-Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO 
and can be online by July 2001 may also apply to be permitted by the Energy 
Commission under the emergency siting process.
-Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within 
four months, shall apply to any proposed simple-cycle thermal powerplant that 
can be brought on line by August 31, 2002  and that have an application for 
certification complete by Dec. 31. 2001.
-Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants, emission 
offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for 
certification
-The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites 
in the state and prepare a report by 02/21/01  identifying those areas of the 
state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to 
augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of 2003.

IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within 7 days of receipt 
of completed application.

Expires 12/31/01 unless extended.

459,"Just to pile on with the issues, I will add a few thoughts of my own for 
issues that we might want to consider in our November 20 comments.   
Re: the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO, Commissioner Massey 
is not totally on board.  He specifically asked about capping the forward 
market.  He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing 
that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe (18-24 
months) and specified rate, and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage 
of their needs from this contract.
A staffer (Don Gelinas) asked whether the forward/bilateral market 
(presumably uncapped) could take care of investment recovery so that 
generation not be cancelled in California.
Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the 
Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap.  Specifically, what 
is opportunity cost?  As long as the test is not known until after the fact, 
there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater 
incentive to sell elsewhere.
Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not 
eliminate the soft cap (his preferred approach), that the cap should be 
temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues 
and retaining the refund liability (he suggested that the refund liability be 
only for one month).
Many, especially the utilities, raised their position that the Commission 
should not institute penalties only on the load.  They claimed this was 
one-sided and suggested if penalties were required, they needed to be applied 
to the supply side as well.  They also argued that the load could not meet 
the 5% test.
Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commission's 
encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their 
authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities' purchases.
Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation 
before deregulation - normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of 
today.  The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include 
stranded costs.
There was almost no support for the single price auction in California.
The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be 
changed, but that California had jurisdiction to change it, not FERC.  A 
Court battle was threatened.

market based rates on RTO participation.

GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the ""voluntary"" nature 
of Order No. 2000.
Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is 
premature due to Southern's ""significant progress"" in developing an RTO.  
Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating 
that the Investigation is based on ""perception,"" not fact, and contains 
conclusions that are ""ill-formed.""  Southern concludes that the ""Southeastern 
bulk power market worked quite well"" this summer because there were no price 
spikes.  Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge

472,"EPMI won a moral as well as financial victory today in the continuing MAPP 
refund proceeding.  In response to EPMI's protest of MAPP's refund report, 
FERC issued an order rejecting MAPP's report, finding that MAPP erred in 
failing to make total refunds to EPMI and others.  As you may recall, in 
response to the complaint filed by EPMI in 1997, FERC issued an order in 
April, 1999, finding that MAPP had overcharged EPMI and other transmission 
customers for transmission service.  FERC ordered MAPP to make refunds to 
EPMI and the other transmission customers.  

In order to make refund payments to customers, MAPP sought payment from its 
transmission owning members.  One transmission owning member, Nebraska Public 
Power District (NPPD), refused to pay MAPP, arguing that it is a 
non-jurisidictional entity and should not have to pay FERC-ordered refunds.  
Because NPPD refused to pay MAPP, MAPP refused to refund to transmission 
customers those amounts assessed against NPPD.  When MAPP filed its refund 
report with FERC (as required by FERC in the April order), MAPP stated that 
it was not refunding those amounts owed by NPPD.  EPMI protested MAPP's 
report, arguing that MAPP is responsible for paying the full amount of 
refunds, regardless of its dispute with NPPD.

In its order issued today, FERC rejects MAPP's filing, stating that ""[w]e 
agree with Enron.""  (This may be the first time FERC has ever uttered that 
phrase.)  FERC states that Enron and the other customers are entitled to the 
full amount of refunds, and MAPP cannot use its dispute with NPPD to escape 
its obligation to pay full refunds.  While FERC does not address the issue of 
whether MAPP is a public utility itself (an argument we made in our protest), 
FERC does state that it has the authority to order MAPP's jurisdictional 
public utility members (through MAPP) to pay the full amount of refunds owed. 
 FERC directs MAPP to refund the full amounts owed and to submit a revised 
refund report.",,,"EPMI MAPP FERC Nebraska Public

IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.

I understand there is concern that the value associated with the assignment of the Lincoln Electric Sales Agreement to OPPD is not sufficient to justify paying $1.3 million to OPPD in order for them to assume this contract. 

There are some considerations on this contract which I think are important and which may not have been mentioned to you:

- The original sales contract to Lincoln was entered into several years ago and is one of the contracts sometimes referred to internally as ""toxic waste"".
- About a month ago, we agreed verbally with OPPD to accept assignment of the sales contract, as OPPD is one of the few parties which can serve it.
- The execution of the documents has been delayed by Lincoln, who were initially refusing to consent to the assignment
- We have another, larger under-water transaction with OPPD which we would like to move off the books at some point. We'd like to keep OPPD happy to improve the chances that we can negotiate their buyout of our other sales contract to them)
- If we fail to deliver, we will be subject to penalties in the amount of $45,0000 per MW on top of Liquidated Damages (Lincoln is 15 MW for 02 and 30 MW for 03).
- This is a highly constrained area (only 6 counterparties can physically deliver in this area and OPPD is the only one which has the surplus power in order to serve Lincoln): the chance that we will be unable to deliver is high.
- There is intangible value associated with not being in a situation where Enron fails to deliver.
- Even if we do wind up serving the contract, the highly constrained nature of the area means we will likely be forced to pay extortionate prices for the power we do acquire.
- Trading wishes to be out of this contract for aforementioned reasons and the fact that it will be very labour intensive to serve (day-ahead notice on 20% monthly load factor)

Obviously, if the above is not sufficient justification to put the money out the door now, then we will smooth things as much as possible with OPPD - but I wanted to make sure you had all the info. before we kill the deal. 

Terri has stalled OPPD until Monday.

I am in town and would like to meet up with you when you get a chance but have a hot question for you.

We have a new steel trade in London that is a back to back where we make $100,000.  It has us issuing an LC but we will be receiving an LC from the purchasers. Note we will get the LC from the purchaser prior to us posting an LC to the producer. If we need to post cash we can discount the LC from the purchaser to post cash. 

I think this meets the objectives but want to check with you. 

thanks and I will set up a time on your schedule.

Energy Cos Limit Business With Enron After 10Q -Traders
By Mark Golden

11/20/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Many energy trading companies were unwilling to sell
power and natural gas for next day delivery to Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday
morning, a result of heightened credit concerns following the release of
Enron's quarterly financial report Monday, traders and other sources said.

  For weeks, companies have limited both buying and selling with Enron for
future deliveries. But for the first time since Enron's troubles began a month
ago, energy companies weren't selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear
that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month.
  ""It's pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for
now,"" said Charlie Sanchez, energy market manager for Gelber & Associates in
Houston.

  Traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn't sell to
Enron Tuesday morning. Several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the
situation, but declined to say so on the record.

  ""Nobody will take Enron,"" one western electricity broker said. After
struggling, however, that broker eventually found a utility that was willing
to sell to Enron Tuesday morning.

  Calpine, a prominent independent power producer and trader, said it was
willing to sell power to Enron.

  ""We continue to sell power to Enron and are monitoring the situation
closely,"" spokeswoman Catherine Potter said.

  The situation Tuesday morning was fluid. One utility that refused to sell to
Enron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon, a person at the
company said. That company's trading, however, was still limited to the spot
markets.

  Credit concerns about the once-dominant energy trading company were
heightened with Enron's filing of its third quarter annual report Monday
evening with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.

  Enron may have to pay $690 million on a note that became a demand obligation
with the company's most recent credit-rating downgrade, Enron said in Monday's
filing. The company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter could
be hurt by credit concerns, a decline in asset values and reduced trading
activity.

  ""The 10Q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns,"" Fitch
analyst Ralph Pellecchia said. ""We have a lot of questions outstanding
relative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how they
are going to manage the situation.""

  Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets,
because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no
credit risk for the buyer.",Mark Golden Charlie Sanchez Calpine Catherine Potter Ralph Pellecchia,$690 million,"FYI Dow Jones Energy Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc. Enron Corp. ENE Enron Gelber & Associates the

520,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

     (Updates with Chief Financial Officer Fastow didn't
immediately return a call for comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares have
fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest
energy trader's dealings with partnerships run by its chief
financial officer contributed to investment losses.

     Enron's stock dropped 10 percent today. Enron's board cost
the company at least $35 million by allowing Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
partnerships that bought Enron assets, a shareholder alleged
Wednesday in a lawsuit.

     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion
in third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street
Journal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with the
two limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equity
by $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the
partnerships, the paper reported yesterday.

     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at John
Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you are
someone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time to
punt with Enron.''

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or written
requests seeking comment. Fastow didn't immediately return a
telephone call for comment.

     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 million
last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital
increases on an investment of about $3 million in one of the
partnerships, the Journal reported today.

                        Buying Enron Assets

     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and
partnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,
based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.

     The foreign business corporations and limited liability
companies have directors, officers or managers whose address is
listed as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,
according to Texas records.

     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member in
each one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enron
assets, including foreign power plants.

     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managing
member, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt last
year.

    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to use
the proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other
``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants or
companies since 1999 and sold four.

     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests about
Fastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the
value of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or company
executives at Enron's expense.

     Shares of Enron fell $2.95 to $26.05. They have fallen
69 percent this year.

Give me a call on this one.  ",Kevin,,
542,"Jack:

    We routinely work with applications that have been ""sent to the national
office.""  If an application is ""sent to the national office,"" it means that
an issue or issues have been identified in the application by the original
reviewing agent that give the agent pause, and which the agent feels a more
technical review by a more skilled agent is required.  It always means that
there is some problem with the application that could result in denial of the
application.

    I suspect that what the IRS would really like your client to do is
establish objective standards in your organization's fundamental documents
for determining who is to receive the assistance of the charity.   Such
standards would give the IRS assurance that only poor people would receive
the benefits, and make it easier to determine if the mission was being
adhered to in an audit of activities.  Addressing this concern could be as
simple as enacting a Bylaw amendment or more likely an amendment to the
Articles of Incorporation.

    Last year, our office was brought in at the ""national office"" stage, well
after the Form 1024 was filed, to help a group of ranchers and cattlemen in
Wyoming/Montana opposed to illegal imports of below cost beef, to obtain
trade association status, (501(c)(6)), that the national office kept trying
to deny by saying they were an agriculture organization (which meant
potentially less availability of tax deductible contributions under o162).
What we did in that case was setup a conference call with the client's
lawyers and the IRS national office team assigned to the file.  We talked
through the application, identified each and every problem the IRS had
identified, and then our firm prepared, in essence, a supplemental brief
addressing each issue.  In the process, we learned that a few minor changes
to the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, plus the supplemental
application information, were enough to address the IRS's agents concerns,
and they issued the tax determination letter.

    Thus, I would suggest that you request a conference call with the
national office agent or ""team"" reviewing the application, and get them to
identify each and every concern with the application.   Then, ask them for a
period of time to respond.  Ask them if changes in the fundamental corporate
documents would help address their concerns.  And of course, be mindful that
if you have had ongoing activities, you will want to be sure that anything
you do will result in retroactive deductibility for what contributions you
have already received.

    During late 1999, the IRS was accused of responding to political pressure
in triggering audits of exempt organizations by the Landmark Legal
Foundation, a conservative, Washington, D.C. legal foundation.  Landmark did
a Freedom of Information Act request and released documents which tended to
indicate that the IRS was auditing groups in response to complaints from
Congressmen.  The IRS denied that political influence plays a role in its
decisions, and, since then, the IRS exempt organizations unit has been very
careful about not creating an impression that they respond to political
pressure.

    If your client would like our firm to help as a consultant to work with
the national office, we'd be pleased to be of assistance.  We would need to
review the file and have your client execute a Form 2848 Power of Attorney
for us to join the team.

    Hope this is helpful.

<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Andrew:

Commodity futures sank ahead of the three-day weekend,
led by sharp falls in Silver, Gold, Grains and Exotics.
Stocks failed to recover from a rough week after IBM
and Microsoft gave gloomy outlooks on Friday.  True to
form, the Dollar stayed firm though FX traders expect
a correction shortly.  The approaching Martin Luther
King, Jr. holiday curbed activity, but didn't prevent
widespread declines that reached to Coffee and Cocoa,
while Sugar and Cotton also faded.  In Grains & Oilseeds,
Corn fell on a Spark's seedings report, South American
weather pushed Soybeans lower, and Wheat ended near its
weekly lows.  Sharply lower lease rates affected Silver,
while fund selling weighed on Gold.  Copper was lackluster.
Crude Oil rebounded from declines on Thursday, but not
too convincingly.  Short-covering boosted Cattle.

Aquila Energy said it has been awarded a $550 million long-term contract to 
supply 154 Bcf of natural gas over 12 years to members of the American Public 
Energy Agency (APEA). It is the fourth contract the agency has awarded to 
Aquila since 1998. 

""With the future of gas prices becoming more and more unknown because of 
increasing demands and tightening supply, our members will benefit greatly 
from this long-term contract,"" said Roger Mock, president and chief executive 
officer of APEA. 

Under the three previous contracts with APEA Aquila is supplying the agency 
with 14.4 Bcf of gas over ten years, 91 Bcf over 12 years and 141 Bcf over 12 
years. All together, Aquila is providing APEA with more than 400 Bcf over the 
next 12 years. 

APEA provides a reliable supply of natural gas to many municipal utilities 
and other public entities throughout the United States. These public buyers 
serve thousands of homes and businesses. 

""Our strategy is to provide our customers with the most effective portfolio 
of services, both financially and physically, to enhance their competitive 
position in managing their energy needs,"" said Tom McCarthy, vice president 
of structured transactions for Aquila Energy.

On the insurance, I would prefer that we go with set insurance requirements, 
$10m in coverage (without aggregate), deductible no greater than $25,000 for 
which they are responsible.  We also need a Best rating of A-XIII or better. 
Also, we need a specific reference to the fact that the new member will be 
responsible for the insurance required in article 19.2 of the turbine 
contract.  The certificate of insurance should be a buyer deliverable at 
closing.

Would it be better to address our ability to put the member interest to them 
on or before [some date- maybe Dec 02], just to get it on the table? 

Term- I'm thinking we may want to be indemnified for longer than 60 days 
after commercial ops, as a claim could be brought against us for something 
they did (and for which we should be indemnified) for longer than that, but 
we would be out of luck, except to the extent insurance took care of it.  
Maybe we should address reps/warranties separate from indemnities, with the 
indemnities lasting longer.

I'd make the confidentiality agreement last for 2  years in this deal.

I'd broaden 9 (xii) to include the acquisition of the equipment, not just the 
facility agreement.

14.  I would reformulate 14 to negotiate around the statement that the 
equipment is being acquired from ENA.  I would also eliminate ""or any other 
third party"" on the fifth line.

Defined terms:  ""Commercial operations"" isn't in the definitions of the 
turbine contract, although there may be a definition imbedded in their 
somewhere (an EECC specialty).  Please verify.

Do we intend to attach a form LLC agreement?

________________________________________________________________

The past couple weeks have witnessed higher volatility in the
currency markets, in the wake of a political and economic
meltdown in Argentina, and as two nuclear-armed nations (India
and Pakistan) step up their war rhetoric. Let's get the opinions
of two seasoned and respected market analysts: David Hightower,
editor of the Hightower Report (http://www.futures-research.com)
and Jim Wyckoff, proprietor of ""Jim Wyckoff on the Markets.""

FUTURESOURCE.COM: Dave, give us a basic fundamental
perspective on the U.S. dollar and its major counterparts.

HIGHTOWER: The U.S. dollar appears to have an entrenched bullish
sentiment over the Euro and we would expect interest in the
dollar to increase into the kick-off of the physical Euro
currency implementation.

However, it would seem that the dollar was quickly shut off from
further buying this past week when it reached above 118. This is

****************************************************************

the second time that the dollar has been quickly repelled from
that level.

We have been suggesting for weeks that the US dollar is holding
an extreme premium versus most of the world's currencies.
Therefore, a leveling out of economic conditions would seem to
pressure the dollar.

We also think that the U.S. dollar has seen an unsustainable
windfall off of Japanese yen weakness. Therefore, it is possible
that the dollar will see a blow-off top in the coming week and
that a major top could be formed.

Historically, it would seem that several major turns in the
currency markets have come in close proximity to the beginning
of a new year. In the event that the dollar does turn down, we
have to think that the Canadian and the Swiss will see the most
significant recovery capacity.

FUTURESOURCE.COM: Jim, give us more of a technical view on the
U.S. dollar index and the major IMM currency futures.

WYCKOFF: The past two weeks have seen the March U.S. dollar
index spring sharply higher, after prices had been trending
lower during late November and the first have of December. Last
week, the March dollar index hit a high of 118.85, and has since
seen some healthy consolidation of the recent strong gains.

The dollar index bulls indeed have the near term edge, and the
longer-term charts are also friendlier to the bulls. If the
bulls can push the March dollar index above the 119.00 level,

that will give them the momentum to challenge the July high of
121.29. A drop below 114.75 means the market will likely
languish in more of a choppy and sideways trading range in the
near term.

Bulls should be warned that if prices do sell off from here, a
big head-and-shoulders top reversal pattern could develop on the
weekly continuation chart for nearby dollar index futures. But
right now, the bulls are enjoying the technical advantage.

As for the Euro currency, the weekly continuation chart for
nearby Euro futures should give the bulls some encouragement, as
well as throw a scare into U.S. dollar index bulls. A longer-
term downtrend line drawn off the 1998 high was penetrated on
the upside and negated just about a year ago. Since that time,
prices have been trading sideways in a choppy pattern. This
choppy trading has also formed a coiling pattern--whereby the
sideways trading range has become more compacted the past
several weeks. This is suggestive of a bigger ""breakout-type""
price move in the not-too-distant future.

Given the recent lowly price levels in the Euro, odds do favor
that potential breakout being to the upside. There is also
potential for a big double-bottom reversal pattern on the weekly
chart. Indeed, there are clues on this chart that suggest the
Euro currency bulls will enjoy more success in the coming year
than they did in the past year.

From a shorter-term perspective, if March Euro currency futures
prices drop down below the November low of .8708, then the door
is opened to much more downside. If that low can hold and prices
work higher, then a big double-bottom reversal could be in the
works.

Finally, the Japanese yen has been in a nosedive for nearly two
months. This steep decline appears to be a ""washout"" or
exhaustion-type selling phase that many times precedes a major
change in trend. But bottom-pickers should beware. Right now,
would-be long-side traders do not want to stand in front of a
steaming locomotive. They should first let the market show them
some solid signals of strength before attempting to board the
bullish train.

look forward to more of your insight in the coming weeks.

634,"An event of Force Majeure occurred on Northern Border (NBPL) on July 13 at =
Station 8 resulting in curtailment of deliveries through Ventura from July1=
3-18.  As a result, ENA was not able to take full delivery of firm volumes =
from EC at the Monchy upstream interconnect.

EC and ENA hold divergent views on how to implement the curtailment.  We ne=
ed to reach a common understanding.

The view of EC is that a force majeure event, as defined by Article 5 of ou=
r master agreement with ENA (see Attachment) or superceded by amendments co=
ntained in individual confirmation letters, implies that all firm transacti=
ons must be curtailed ""by the same percentage that the applicable transport=
er interrupts or curtails firm delivery service..."" (language in parenthese=
s was directly lifted from a Monchy confirmation letter dated November 1, 1=
997 signed by Julie Gomez). =20

The view of ENA, as articulated by Martin and Lisa, is that Northern Border=
 sends scheduled volumes back to Unify via EDI with a service agreeement pa=
thed to a firm supply deal.  The pipeline scheduled volume for the path dri=
ves how much each individual  deal is curtailed  even if some supply deals =
are cut by a different percentage than others. My apologies if I have not e=
xpressed this properly.

In other words, we agree on the magnitude of the curtailment but not how to=
 allocate cuts to individual deals.

Because we have desk to desk deals (since earlier this year), ENA and EC mu=
st agree on scheduled volumes.  In the past our deals were Physical Forward=
 and if our volumes did not agree it was not discovered until invoicing, at=
 which time the accountants would duke it out.  Now, Logistics quite proper=
ly has to deal with it within the month.  This has implications at all poin=
ts where ENA transacts with EC such as Kingsgate, Empress, Eastern Canada.

EC  has reluctantly agreed to accept ENA's non-proportional scheduled volum=
es for this event so that the schedulers can move on but I would appreciate=
 a policy resolution to this issue prior to the next downstream curtailment=

Attachment

Legal Opinion dated July 20, 2001

Kevin, further to your voice-mail, as indicated to you yesterday, our physi=
cal gas master agreement with ENA is in their form of Enfolio master agreem=
ent and not our form of master.  What that means is that, although the mech=
anics of declaring force majeure, etc. are the same, the definition of forc=
e majeure under our Enfolio master with ENA is not restricted to delivery p=
oint force majeure as it is in ECC's standard form, but is rather a broader=
 based force majeure.  However, it must be kept in mind that, depending on =
the transaction, the definition of ""force majeure"" may be amended in the te=
rms of the particular confirmation letter.  The application section (which =
is basically the same as in our form) is as follows:

This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted un=
der this Agreement, and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived to=
 the extent permitted by law.  Except with regard to payment obligations, i=
n the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Ma=
jeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such P=
arty's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the othe=
r Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writ=
ing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent that t=
hey are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and d=
uring the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in=
 the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The P=
arty receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as =
it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part =
thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Da=
y period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder a=
nd both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform...

I will send a copy of the agreement over to you which also contains the def=
inition of Force Majeure, but again it must be remembered that such definit=
ion may be amended in the particular confirm.

639,"Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.

Western Spot Power Prices Sink Amid River Runoff, Mild Weather

     Portland, Oregon, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Western U.S.
peak spot power prices for delivery tomorrow plummeted as
hydroelectric operators were forced to generate power, traders
said.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
declined 38.4 percent from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of
$140.55 a megawatt hour, with executed trades between $135.00-
$150.00.
     ""Run-off is increasing hydroelectric supplies,"" said one
Northwest trader.
     Traders said that smaller dams in the Portland area don't
have the capability to store excess water from mountain snowmelt,
so they have to generate power or spill water.
     ""The weather is mild in the Northwest, causing snow melt to
run off into the reservoirs,"" said one Northwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington,
Massachusetts, temperatures in Portland, Oregon were expected to
reach 63 degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing tomorrow 2 degrees
to 65 degrees.
     At the California Oregon Border, day-ahead peak power sank
$106.67 to a Bloomberg index of $140.00. Traders completed trades
in the $135.00-$145.00 range.
     In the Pacific Northwest, federal power marketer Bonneville
Power Administration offered up to 200 megawatts of delivered
energy for tomorrow at the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia and California-
Oregon Border firm electricity index price.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power slipped
$72.20, to a Bloomberg index of $150.92 as traders executed
transactions in the $140.50-$150.00 range. Traders said they sold
off-peak power as low as $21.00 and as high as $40.00.
     Traders said that Arizona Public Service Co.'s 1,270-
megawatt Palo Verde 1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona,
increased production 20 percent from yesterday to 70 percent of
capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage
that began March 31.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power slumped $73.33 to a Bloomberg index of $139.67 amid trades
in the $135.00-$145.00 range.

Northeast Spot Power Prices Steady Amid Idle Market Conditions

     Philadelphia, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Spot power prices
in the Northeast U.S. were little changed this morning, amid
expectations for continued increases in available generation and
stagnant cooling loads, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demands 89 and 97 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Thursday delivery was assessed 65 cents
higher, at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $33.80 per
megawatt hour.
     Traders said tomorrow's projected load requirements and
generation outages were virtually unchanged, leaving little room
for movement in the day-ahead market.
     The Interconnection projected loads for the first six on-peak
hours of tomorrow to average just 100 megawatts greater than
today, and increases in available generation were estimated at
only 23 megawatts.
     The next-week market was volatile however, as revised weather
forecasts, calling for cooler temperatures, left many marketers
scrambling to readjust positions.
     ""The weather forecast for next-week has been drastically
revised,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""Anyone holding excess power
for that period was looking to unload it this morning, and the
market just fell out of bed from there.""
     Traders said early morning trades topped out at $48.00,
before trailing off to lows in the $40.00-$41.00 range.
     In the New England Power Pool, day-ahead power sold 25 cents
lower amid trades in the $51.50-$52.50 range, with most deals
executed at $52.00.
     Entergy Corp. said it began the process of restarting its
670-megawatt Pilgrim 1 nuclear reactor at 3:07 a.m., although
traders agreed the additional megawatts didn't affect tomorrow's
market.
     ""It's not a very big unit, so a minimal increase in
production isn't going to make a noticeable difference,"" said one
Northeast trader. ""I'm sure it will be reflected in tomorrow's
day-ahead market, when output will be closer to capacity.""
     Next-week packages traded heavily in New England, as they did
in PJM, though prices for the 5-day block there remained firm at
$55.00. Traders said heavy purchases from one of the region's load
serving entities might have helped support the market, by
offsetting forecasts for cooler temperatures.
     Temperatures in Boston, one of New England's primary load
centers, are forecast to average less than 60 degrees through the
early part of next week.

Southeast Demand Again Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Continued high
weather-related demand from the Southeast and a combination of
unit outages and transmission problems in the Midwest drove Mid-
Continent peak power prices up again today, traders said.
     East Central Area Reliability Council prices rose for the
fourth consecutive day as heavy weather-related demand from the
Tennessee Valley Authority grid continued, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for day-ahead power delivered into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $6.11
to $46.25 a megawatt-hour and has gained almost $19.00 this week.
Trades ranged from $44.50 up to $50.00 after options expiration.
     Cinergy traders said the late price rise came as marketers
oversold to TVA and had to buy power back from there to cover
short positions.
     In contrast to the daily market, short-term over-the-counter
prices dropped, with power for Friday delivery offered $2.00 less
than yesterday's price for Thursday-Friday parcels at $41.00 and
power for delivery from May 21-25 offered $7.00 less at $40.50.
     ""There's a new weather forecast out, and it's going to be a
lot cooler next week now than we originally thought,"" one trader
said. ""I wish I'd sold myself way short on the next week package
yesterday, but what can you do?""
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power at
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub sold $2.46 higher on
average at $40.00-$46.00 and power in the lower half of the
region $2.79 higher on average at $46.00-$52.00.
     MAIN traders said transmission constraints all but
eliminated the ability to sell power west into the Mid-Continent
Area Power Pool, causing market focus to shift to the South and
East.
     With several unit outages and transmission problems,
continued hot weather and imports from MAIN unavailable, day-
ahead power prices in MAPP were the highest in the region again
today, traders said.
     Next-day power sold $1.00 higher on average in northern MAPP
at $50.00-$55.00 and 33 cents higher in the southern half of the
region at $50.00-$55.00. Traders said activity was limited, as
most utilities had no excess power available.
     ""It's still in the 80s (degrees) here, which is much hotter
than we're used to this early in the year,"" one trader said. ""Add
to that these unit outages, and you get what we have right now; a
pretty big mess.""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Recent Heat Moderates

     Atlanta, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as several major regional
population centers expected cooler weather tomorrow, while
others expected weather to remain hot, utility traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose an average of 39 cents a megawatt-
hour from equivalent trades made yesterday for delivery today,
to $47.77, amid trades in the $36.50-$60.00 range.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 87 degrees Fahrenheit,
unchanged from today's projected high.
     In sections of the Southwest Power Pool, tomorrow's
projected highs for Topeka, Kansas, were expected to decline to
the high-70s to low-80s tomorrow, utility traders said.
     ""There was not a lot of trading done in the next-day
markets because we expect to see a break in the weather,"" said
one SPP-based utility trader. ""Our temperatures, which are
expected to hit the 92-94 degree mark today, will decline to
about 10 degrees below normal tomorrow.""
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., cooling demand across the Southeast was expected to
average about normal over the next week.
     Over the next 6-10 days, temperatures in the Southeast are
expected to average 3.1 degrees below normal, the forecaster
said.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power for tomorrow
traded in a ""broad"" range of $40.00-$53.00, though the majority
of energy trades were reported at a Bloomberg index of $44.57,
24 cents more than yesterday.
     Expectations for continued warm weather on the U.S. Gulf
Coast and troubling transmission line loading relief measures
between sections of southern Mid-Continent Area Power Pool and
the northern SPP, kept Entergy Corp. prices from falling,
traders said.
     The Bloomberg day-ahead peak Entergy index fell 2 cents
from yesterday to $49.73 amid trades in the $45.00-$55.00
range.
     Traders said prices could dip tomorrow in the Gulf Coast
region because natural gas futures for June delivery on the New
York Mercantile Exchange were slipping. June futures declined
28.3 cents per million British thermal units to $4.38 per
million Btu.

U.K. Winter Power Contracts Little Changed in Heavy Trade

     London, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Winter 2001 power prices
in the U.K. closed little changed today, although the contract was
unusually active, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload was last assessed 10 pence lower at
21.30-21.40 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Although Winter 2001 traded over 60 times, one trader said
the contract traded ""range-bound'' throughout the day, as
participants purchased and sold the contract in an effort to
create liquidity in the market.
     ""Its unprecedented for over 800 megawatts to have traded and
we've seen little change. It's evident a player out there is very
keen to get liquidity going in the market,'' another trader said.
     Traders said the two major trading houses that have been
trading the contract aggressively over the past week were the main
market participants again today.
     Day-ahead prices tumbled today even though reports of outage
problems persisted, traders said.
     British Energy's Sizewell B nuclear plant was reported to
have shut for maintenance last Friday because of an acid leak,
although this couldn't be confirmed.
     ""The spot market continued to be volatile. We are still
seeing a lot of panic buying and selling,'' one trader said. ""It
seems people must have overbought in preparation for these planned
outages and now need to sell.''
     Day-ahead baseload started trade at 23.50 pounds a megawatt-
hour, before plummeting to trade at 18.00 pounds a megawatt-hour,
5.00 pounds lower than yesterday.

Nordic Electricity Prices Close Higher on Elevated Spot Value

     Lysaker, Norway, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, rose in
active afternoon trade after generators set tomorrow's spot price
above expectations, traders said.
Participants rushed to close positions ahead of a Norwegian
holiday tomorrow that will keep the market closed. Nordpool is
scheduled to re-open on Friday.
     Winter-2, 2001 jumped 1.75 kroner a megawatt-hour to close at
a record high of 218.25 kroner a megawatt-hour with 449.00
megawatts exchanged. Winter-1, 2002 gained 2.10 kroner after
166.00 megawatts traded between 216.00-218.75 kroner a megawatt-
hour.
     Although industrial end-user demand was anticipated to drop
tomorrow as Norway celebrates Constitution Day, Thursday's system
area average price was set at 195.41 kroner a megawatt-hour, more
than 10 kroner above traders' expectations of 185.00 kroner a
megawatt-hour and down 2.97 kroner from today's price.
     Producers in western Norway retained control over inflowing
molten snow, pushing prices higher, an Oslo-based trader said. The
minimum hourly spot price in Trondheim, Norway was set at 190.88
kroner a megawatt-hour, only 4.53 kroner lower than the system
area average price.
     Nordpool reported an expected 2.5 percent increase in
Norwegian reservoirs to 34.7 percent of total capacity at the end
of week 19 from the previous week, compared to 49.9 percent of
total capacity a year ago. In Sweden, reservoirs were up 7.9
percent to 33.2 percent of total capacity, beating expectations of
a 5.2 percent gain.
     Snowmelt in Norway was likely to peak in the next ten days,
delaying water tank refilling, while in Sweden it peaked last
week, traders said.
     Limited snow accumulation in the important hydro-producing
region of western Norway has also minimized the effect of
anticipated supply increases.
     In the shorter-term, week 21 closed 1.50 kroner higher at
195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 286.00 megawatts
traded as low as 190.75 kroner a megawatt-hour. Week 22 jumped
5.00 kroner a megawatt-hour to 204.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Total volumes more-than-quadrupled in afternoon trade to
3,717 gigawatt-hours generation compared to this morning's 738
gigawatt-hours.

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.

GUARANTY AGREEMENT

 This Guaranty Agreement (this ""Guaranty""), dated as of ________, is made and 
entered into between ________________, a ___________ corporation (""Guarantor
""), and ______________________, a _____________ ___________ (""Contract 
Party"").

 WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ____________________, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Guarantor (""Obligor""), are contemplating entering into an 
ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date here-with and herein 
incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time 
to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without 
limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the ""Gas Contract""), (ii) Guarantor 
will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (iii) as a 
condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party 
has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all 
payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract.

 NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract, 
Guarantor agrees as follows: 
 
1.  PAYMENT GUARANTY.  Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally 
guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in 
the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract 
(the ""Obligations""); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never 
exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.  This guaranty of payment is 
a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until 
complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and 
payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty 
shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas 
Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive 
the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas 
Contract (the ""Indemnity Period"").  With respect to any Claims threatened or 
filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from 
any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations 
or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and 
Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations 
or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to 
its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, 
(ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought 
against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should 
Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, 
without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or 
procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or 
any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person 
or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action 
separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other 
person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of 
Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any 
other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning 
which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail 
to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its 
obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other 
person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against 
Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of 
Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and 
Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to 
time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of 
the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the 
modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas 
Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of 
limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract 
Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any 
right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other 
person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of 
Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or 
extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, 
(v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, 
without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or 
reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights 
or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release 
or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance 
by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas 
Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of 
the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other 
obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed 
or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the 
failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or 
security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or 
the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, 
or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other 
indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, 
actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor 
shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or 
indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in 
tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any 
person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.  Upon 30 Days written 
notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a 
guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better 
creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit 
rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information 
concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both 
current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party 
in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a 
form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, 
taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply 
to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all 
such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of 
credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and 
delivery.
2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations 
in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that 
ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed 
$_____________ (the ""Maximum Limit""); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and 
Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable 
expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and 
similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or 
other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected 
by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or 
application of any collateral by Contract Party.
3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor 
retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights, 
setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the 
Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, 
counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, 
dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.      
4.  DEFAULT.  If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, 
Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers 
and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing 
this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then 
owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon 
such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and 
demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of 
default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to 
Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby 
WAIVES.  
5.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:  
(i) it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of 
the State of its incorporation and has the power and authority to execute, 
deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) no 
authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, 
any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is 
required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this 
Guaranty and (iii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof 
by Contract Party, this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding 
agree-ment of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as 
the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting 
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.
6.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  At the written request of Contract Party, 
Guarantor shall provide Contract Party with the financial information 
described in Appendix ""1"" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in 
accordance therewith.
7.  NOTICE.  All notices and communications made pursuant to this Guaranty

Great to hear from you.  To be sure, it's jazz, not classical.  I've
still got some growing to do.  I think of you every time I put on The
Essential Stan Getz (sp?).  Great recommendation.  I've bought some Nina
Simone lately -- most recently Best Of and Blues.  
 
I did see Run Lola Run -- great movie.  Haven't been going to the movies
a lot lately b/c of Alex (my new son).  It's a fair trade though.  I'll
pick up ""Momento"" next time I'm at Blockbuster, and check out the
classical discs you recommended.  
 
Work is good -- I'm not sure if you know what we do -- we buy people out
of their lp interests before the term of the partnership.  Esentially,
providing liquidity to an otherwise illiquid market.  There's a lot of
crap on the market these days, but every now and then you get someone
selling good interest too.  It's mentally stimulating and professionally
accretive, so I'm very happy.  Thanks again for the referral -- that was
very helpful in making it all happen.
 
Well, I'll scan my recent disc purchases to see if there's any other
buys I think you ought to put on your list.

I am very disappointed to learn that you will be unable to join our energy
finance program next fall.  However, I'm pleased that you are willing to
keep trying.

I suggest that if possible, you take an MBA level finance class at U of
Houston this summer.  If you can get an A in the class, I will personally
argue your case to the admissions Dean.  I was also told that your chances
of getting in would improve considerably if you raise your GMAT over 500.

Its clearly a long shot, but we should still try to get you into the
program next fall.

Let me know how things are going.

I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my GMAT 
score.  If the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on this 
disability I can do that.  Due to this disability, the GMAT score is not a 
good indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned in my 
work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will be able 
to successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me know what 
I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly appreciate it.  If

 ANSWERS TO INTERROGATORIES


INTERROGATORY NO. 1:

Please describe in detail the factual and legal basis for your contention
that CPSC =01&breached the Assignment Agreement=018 by allegedly =01&failin=
g to
endeavor in good faith to obtain the consent from LCRA.=018

ANSWER:  On July 30, 1999, Calpine entered into an agreement with Enron in
which it agreed to assume Enron=01,s obligation to supply power to the LCRA
under the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 31, 199=
5
and as it was amended on April 15, 1999.  The July 30, 1999 Assignment
Agreement contains a condition that Calpine will obtain LCRA=01,s written
consent to the assignment and a release of Enron and its affiliates from an=
y
and all obligations and liabilities under the Agreement.  Calpine
specifically agreed to endeavor in good faith to obtain LCRA=01,s consent a=
s
soon as practicable following Enron=01,s execution of the Assignment Agreem=
ent.
Shortly after the execution of the Assignment Agreement, Ed Baughman and
Steve Snow spoke to determine the status of Calpine=01,s efforts to obtain =
LCRA
=01,s consent.  Mr. Baughman followed up with Mr. Snow during the week of
August 16, 1999 to determine the status of Calpine=01,s efforts to obtain L=
CRA=01,
s consent.  It was clear from Mr. Baughman=01,s conversation with Mr. Snow =
that
Calpine was not exercising its best efforts to obtain LCRA=01,s consent.  W=
hen
this became apparent, Mr. Baughman and others at Enron began making
inquiries of LCRA to determine what would be required to obtain LCRA=01,s
consent.  These conversations made it clear that Calpine had not explored
the issue with the LCRA.  Further, Enron representatives were advised by
representatives of the LCRA that Calpine had not furnished any financial
information to the LCRA to make it comfortable with Calpine=01,s assumption=
 of
the delivery obligations.  Such failure by Calpine to use due diligence in
obtaining LCRA=01,s consent combined with its failure to provide the LCRA w=
ith
any financial or credit information demonstrates that Calpine did not
endeavor in good faith to obtain the LCRA=01,s consent.



INTERROGATORY NO. 2:

Please describe in detail the factual and legal basis for your contention
that CPSC failed =01&to exercise  good faith in agreeing to reasonable requ=
ests
relating to the assignment,=018 specifically identifying each and every all=
eged
=01&reasonable request=018, and when, how, by whom, and under what circumst=
ances
the request was made, and CPSC=01,s response to each request.

ANSWER:  Calpine failed to exercise good faith in agreeing to reasonable
requests relating to the assignment by failing to endeavor in good faith to
obtain LCRA=01,s consent to the assignment, failing to provide LCRA with
financial information and failing to provide LCRA with a parent guaranty
guaranteeing Calpine Power Services Corporation=01,s performance of its
assumption of the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement.
Additionally, Calpine failed to agree to reasonable requests when it failed
to provide an indemnification from its parent corporation indemnifying Enro=
n
in the event that Enron paid any money out on its guaranty to the LCRA.  On
or about August 26, 1999, after it became clear that Calpine was not taking
any effort to endeavor in good faith to obtain the LCRA=01,s consent, David
Portz of Enron sent Ron Fischer of Calpine the documents necessary to
provide Calpine=01,s parent guaranty and indemnification of any payment by
Enron under the LCRA agreement.  Calpine refused to execute these documents
or to negotiate in good faith for any necessary modifications thereto.
Additionally, in a telephone conversation between Enron and Calpine
representatives, Calpine conceded that in the past, it had traditionally
provided a parent guaranty.



INTERROGATORY NO. 3:

Please describe in detail any and all damages allegedly suffered by you and
for which you seek redress herein, and describe in detail the method by
which such damages are calculated.

ANSWER:  Enron has not yet calculated the damages it has incurred as a
result of Calpine=01,s breach of its obligations under the Assignment
Agreement.  Enron continues to have an obligation to supply the LCRA with
power and will be required to do so until the contract terminates on
December 31, 2002.  Enron will supplement this interrogatory in accordance
with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.



INTERROGATORY NO. 4:

Do you contend that CPSC was obligated under the July 30, 1999 Letter to
seek and/or secure a guarantee from Calpine Corporation?  If you answer to
either is =01&yes,=018 please describe in detail the legal and factual basi=
s for
each such contention.

ANSWER:  Yes.  Beginning during approximately the summer of 1998, it became
customary in the wholesale power market to provide a parent guarantee when
the power was either being purchased by or sold to a marketing affiliate.
In a telephone conference on the afternoon of August 27, 1999, Calpine
representatives conceded that they generally provided a parent guaranty.
Additionally, the representatives conceded that it did not cost Calpine
Power Services Company any money to provide a parent guaranty.  In the
negotiations between Enron and Calpine prior to the execution of the
Assignment Agreement, it was understood that Calpine would provide a parent
guarantee.  When the transaction changed from the back-to-back transaction
to the assignment, in recognition of the increased risk, Enron increased th=
e
amount that it was willing to pay Calpine to assume its obligations under
the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement to $1.8 million.  In
recognition that parent guarantees are customary in the industry, in
December of 1999, Calpine and Enron exchanged parent guarantees.


INTERROGATORY NO. 5:

Identify each action which you contend is =01&customary and reasonable in t=
he
industry=018 and which you contend CPSC failed to undertake in order to =01=
&obtain
LCRA=01,s consent=018 to the assignment of the Power Agreement.

ANSWER:  Calpine failed to act in a customary and reasonable manner by
failing to act promptly to obtain the LCRA=01,s consent to Calpine=01,s
assignment.  Further, Calpine failed to act in a customary and reasonable
manner in failing to provide LCRA with any financial information concerning
Calpine Power Services Corporation or its parent in order to assure the LCR=
A
of Calpine=01,s financial ability to perform under the Assignment Agreement=
.
Calpine also failed to provide either Enron or LCRA with a parent guarantee
and to provide parent indemnification to Enron for any amounts paid by Enro=
n
to the LCRA as a result of Calpine=01,s failure to perform its obligations
under the Power Purchase and Sale  Agreement.


INTERROGATORY NO. 6:

Identify and describe in detail each and ever action taken by you to
mitigate your alleged damages in this matter.

ANSWER:  On December 8, 1999, Enron gave notice to the LCRA of its
termination of the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated Augus=
t
31, 1995, as amended on April 15, 1999 effective December 31, 2002.  On
December 31, 1999, Enron entered into an agreement with Oxy Vinyls, L.P.
wherein Enron Power Marketing, Inc. purchased electrical capacity and energ=
y
from Oxy.  Additionally, Enron has purchased the power necessary to supply
the LCRA at the lowest prices available to it in the market.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

766,"	After meeting with Jesus Melendrez this morning, meeting with the Crescendo folks for a few minutes this afternoon (they were in the office in connection with other matters) and talking with the Crescendo lawyer on the phone, I called Chris Sullivan to let him know that his letter to Jim Derrick had been referred to me for handling. I started my conversation with Mr. Sullivan by telling him that I had no substantive knowledge about this matter and that I had talked with the Crescendo folks briefly about his letter and expected that they would respond to the substantive points he raised ""sooner rather than later"".
	Mr. Sullivan was not thrilled with this response indicating that he already knew what Crescendo had to say on the subject. In fact, this was an interesting comment since, at other times during our call, he mentioned that he had been waiting for a reply from Crescendo for months. He then went on for some time about how he had been talking to Crescendo and others about his helium rights for up to 2 years (his time estimates changed as he continued to talk) and that he believed the project was scheduled to go on line in early November and still had not received a satisfactory response from Crescendo. He also mentioned a call to Keith Pruitt at Enron in February and that he hadn't heard back from him either.  It sounded to me like Mr. Sullivan wanted Enron to support his position and intervene on his behalf against Crescendo based only on his letter. 
	 In any event, Mr. Sullivan again threatened to involve the government and go forward with litigation to prevent helium from being wasted.  I reiterated that I could not discuss his substantive concerns, that I was not yet up to speed on this matter and that we would look into it.
	I received from Jesus copies of the correspondence between Crescendo and Mr. Sullivan as well as a legal opinion on Crescendo's obligations, if any, to Mr. Sullivan.  Also included in the information I received were copies of the letters exchanged between Crescendo and the BLM on this matter. I am in the process of reviewing these and expect to talk to Crescendo's attorney this weekend.  In the meantime, he is working on a response to the substantive points raised in Sullivan's letter.
	Please call with any questions or comments. ",Jesus Melendrez Chris Sullivan Jim Derrick Sullivan Crescendo Keith Pruitt Jesus,,Crescendo Enron BLM

AG's subpoena to EES in California and Houston.

	California: Most hard copy documents have been retrieved from the
Costa Mesa office. Two lawyers will be at the San Ramon office this week to
complete the hard copy review there. They will complete the hard copy review
in Costa Mesa next week. We propose a limited review of the e-mail for four
or five EES officers during the following week. We will need clearance from
Bob to allow us to do so effectively. I understand that EES is now giving
notice to  customers that their contracts may be produced. This notice
should be completed soon so we can produce documents at or near the end of
July.
	 The following report, in Word format, from Peter Meringolo and

2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20

and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =

addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=

these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;
East Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and=

this team.
Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =
will=20
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=
le=20
is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=
as=20
gas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20
Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n=

significant changes.
Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=

financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20
specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin=
ue to=20
maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=
=20
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=
=20
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=
=20
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=
=20
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=
=20
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=
=20
Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=
o=20
Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=
ed=20
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
=20
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=
=20
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=
 will=20
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=
=20
involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=
=20
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=
r=20
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20

of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=
nd=20
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=

f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20

 EA=20
OOC.

g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20

h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag=

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=
ll=20

786,"With concerns about curtailments and force majuere events in California, 
Steve Kean has asked for the preparation of study of all possible types of 
disruptions (e.g. curtailment, diversion, penalties, etc,) in the gas chain 
flowing to Calif and who bears the legal/financial liability for each event.  
Specifically, he has asked if ETS can assemble a description of such 
provisions for the pipes delivering to Calif.

In particular, he wants a summary of following:

Curtailment - When do pipelines curtail? 
Curtailment compensation
Imbalance Provisions
Penalties/OFOs
Allocations (For El Paso Only)

Help!  Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions?  Steve

789,"Hey guys,

Well I'm back home in Houston looking out at our lovely skyline (okay, maybe 
it's not that lovely but it is sunny here).  Anyway, I'm so glad I got the 
chance to see all of you while I was in London.  It seemed as though all of 
you are really enjoying your time in the UK - which is good to hear given the 
fact I'm hoping to make it over there myself.  Hope the approaching close to 
2000 finds everyone in good spirits.

Cheers,

790,"Everything goes O.K.  I met with Ted last week for dinner Thursday night...it 
was VERY enlightening.  I'll forward you the email I sent to my sister-in-law 
(it sums everything up pretty well).  Let me know if you want to grab coffee, 
a drink, etc. tonight or tomorrow night - although I think you've got NCL 
tomorrow.  

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual ""talking"" occurred.  Here are the basics...

- There is definitely no ""us"" anymore...and I quote ""sometimes these things 
just fade out""
- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still 
don't
- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)
- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he 
hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three 
years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated quite a bit) - Can you 
say issues?
- He told me ""I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me.""  Of course I agreed with him saying ""I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems."" (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still really enjoyed hanging out 
and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that...not very 
healthy for me) 

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled just it as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A 
clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his 
life that he has not completely dealt with yet, and might never deal with 
completely)

Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll 
talk to you soon.

Susan

By the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and 
maybe just a little harsh)

Talk to you soon, Jen.",Ted Kevin Susan Jen,,

799,"Regardless of your ""misc mind altering"" habits, I think Will did say that they would only be able to have path modifications/cuts modified in the notes part initially.  Then (whenever the ""next"" modification was implemented), they would add the capability to interact with Enpower deals (ie write notes to the deal record and then, provide an entry point for deal entry for new deals done).

The East Group does not need to see POR/POD in the path for ""transmission.""  My intent was to put a counterparty name in the TRAN1 NAME column (example: TVA), and Enpower deal number in TRAN1 DEAL#	(example: 236891.1) if available, and Oasis number + level of reliability in TRAN1 OASIS	 
(example:  30912345 F-7).  I thought the logic for ""Tag"" and ""Oasis"" should be a combination of text and numbers. The reasoning for Border 2 was to have an additional border point to query for (in confirmation) when we move from one place to another. What if you put the borders in the Oasis column (ie: WW/MEAD 123456 F-7)? The path would be: Generation-marketer-E-TRANS(T) WW/MEAD 123456 F-7-E-marketer-Sink.

Question for you.  I was wondering if you could change the first sentence in my letter of recommendation because it talks about FMLA leave and the dates I worked at Enron, which I have on my resume, but I'd rather they didn't know that I have a little one because I don't want them to judge me by that.. or think I'll be a slacker because I won't, and I already have the same babysitter set up and ready to go.  (if I get lucky and get the job)...  :)  I could come by one afternoon this week to pick it up because my interview is Tuesday.  What do you think?  No big deal if not, just thought I'd try.

I left you a voice mail message regarding the above.  If Bear Stearns is 
insistent on its consents/waiver provision, does that mean that ENE cannot 
modify the provision or does it mean that there is some opportunity to 
counter with minor changes.  The provision in totality does not need to be 
deleted, but in order to have our setoff/counterclaim provision work 
properly, we cannot waive all of our defenses.  I am assuming that there are 
mutual obligations on both sides of the table.  If that is the case, then it 
is not unreasonable for ENE to request having reservation of defenses of its 
subs.  I have taken the liberty of modifying the Bear Stearns provision as 
appropriate.  Let me know your thoughts.

886,"I will check if the USVI is part of the US for my purposes.  I get confused
regarding what is the US and what is part of the US imperial system.

Also, if we are a boat leaving US territory and then reentering.....will we
still not have to go through US customs?  I cannot have a customs
official looking up a computer and seeing that I have left the country and
thereby invalidating my green applications.  If USVI and BVI have a close
relationship
and they are not too fussed fine....but somehow I cannot see US immigration
not being fussed.

I do not want to spoil the holiday for you guys, and I know you are not keen
on sailing within the confines of USVI (even if I can get there and that is
another whole problem), so this is just a heads-up I may have to abandon

Attached is a link to the OFAC website, which indicates that Serbia and Montenegro are still sanctioned. <http://ofaccompliance.com/BlockedCountries.htm>

Relatedly, if you are specific about the list of countries in your GTCs, you may want to consider being less specific, as you correctly point out that the list will change from time to time.  

When I last spoke with our external counsel on this matter, she advised me that in large part it is the knowing act of dealing with product destined to or originating from sanctioned countries.  We talked about a soft-peddled rep that does not specifically mention trade sanctions or the countries, but does rep generally about non-violiation of US law.  This is the direction in which I have gone.  Of course, the traders are aware of the list of sanctioned countries, and will be updated from time to time.

I need your help. I would like you guys to prioritize the ""first 10"" and the ""second 10"" firms that we would like to change our existing trading agreements with to allow all of us to use ConfirmLogic.  I would like this process to go forward even if the counterparty has not yet signed up for the module. To my mind, the legal change simply gives us both the option (and perhaps the preference, but not the obligation) to use the module to serve as a legal confirmation.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help speed up the process. As I understand it, only Sempra currently has proposed changes in front of them. I would like us to have proposed changes in front of the top 20 clients by September 20.

Mel is back to work now and maybe things will be getting back to some
what of a normal life for us.  The past year and half has been hard on
us. I know we just have to be patient and things will get better.  You
just go along with life and then when you or your spouse has health
problems it creates a whole new ball game.  I have great faith in the
Lord to see us through any thing.  Mel said to say hi too. ( he just came
up to my office)

When you get an address please email me that so when I finish your quilt
I can mail it to you.

Hope you find a nice man and your life becomes so full that
maybe work will take a back seat.  Maybe a  big house you can fill with
kids?????

Take care of yourself and let me hear from you again.
