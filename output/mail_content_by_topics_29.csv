Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     ""We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop,"" said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-based
trader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long.""
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that.""
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     ""There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too,"" one MAPP trader said.
""It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).""

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     ""There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have,"" said one Texas-based utility power trader.
""Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.""
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.
     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

The release that Jacques prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.

Also May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I have not received payment on either.

Let's try and wrap this up this week.

1bps & the 2-5-10's fly retracted up to 8bps again. The only major swap flow

Date sent:      	Mon, 26 Nov 2001 15:24:12 +0000



Recommendation:
Roll long TYZs now at 39/32 or roll short TYZ
later in week 2 to 3/32 lower.

Rationale:
The TYZ/TYH roll will be impacted by a number of
factors. Most important, we believe, will be changes
in the contract's cheapest-to-deliver caused by market
movements. Changes in CTD will change the amount
of net positive carry that is the primary determinant of
the TYZ/TYH roll's value.

For example, The TYZ/TYH roll priced using the 6.5%
2/10 has 35.75/32 of net carry, while the roll priced with
the 4.7% 11/08 has only 28.5/32 of net carry.

The following was received from a friend:

Most of us remember the Oliver North hearings, but do not recall the name
of Osama bin Laden as the terrorist that North was threatened by. It's
pretty evident in hindsight that we should have listened to Ollie!
In a recent university lecture the other day they played a video of
Oliver North during the Iran-Contra deals during the Reagan
administration.

There was Ollie in front of God and Country getting the third degree. But
what he said was stunning. He was being grilled by some senator who asked
him; 'Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security
system?'

Oliver replied, 'Yes I did sir.'

The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, 'Isn't
this just a little excessive?'

'No sir,' continued Oliver.

'No. And why not?'

'Because the life of my family and I were threatened.'

'Threatened? By who.'

'By a terrorist, sir.'

'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?'

'His name is Osama bin Laden.'

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of
people laughed at the attempt and then the senator continued.
'Why are you so afraid of this man?'

'Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of.'

'And what do you recommend we do about him?'

'If it were me I would recommend an assassin team be formed to eliminate
him and his men from the face of the earth.' The senator disagreed with
this approach and that was the end of the video clip.

It's scary when you think 15 years ago the government was aware of Osama
bin Laden and his potential threat to the security of the world. I guess
like all great tyrants they start small but if left untended spread like
the virus they truly are.""","the Oliver North Osama bin Laden North Ollie Oliver North Reagan Oliver Osama

","Hey Paul Eric

34,"Hi Folks,

This is getting murkier by the minute.  Coach Jim Haslett was pumping up the
team with the ""it's just one player"" talk following the loss of Ricky
Williams and indicated New Orleans would likely not go outside for RB help.
Former Ram Jerald Moore and rookie Chad Morton were slated to carry the
load.  But they did go out and sign Terry Allen Tuesday.  I'm not sure
whether this indicates a lack of confidence in Moore / Morton.  It could be
they thought Allen was a bargain and it certainly can't hurt to have him for
insurance.

As far as the RB distribution goes, I'm kind of leaning toward Moore seeing
a good bit of work with Morton seeing more 3rd down type duties.  Sort of
like the Patriots are doing with JR Redmond and Kevin Faulk.  Honestly, it's
tough to call right now and the Saints understandably are being tight lipped
about their plans.

Here's the story from USA Today.  Thanks to our friend Leo Scanlon for
pointing me to it.

http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/news.htm#saints NEW ORLEANS - Saints
running back Ricky Williams will have surgery Wednesday on the broken left
ankle that ended his regular season. Williams, hurt Sunday against Carolina
on a run that gave him exactly 1,000 yards for the year, is expected to need
6-to-8 weeks of rehabilitation. New Orleans signed former Pro Bowl running
back Terry Allen for the rest of the season on Tuesday. The team waived wide
receiver Charlie Jones to make room on the active roster. Allen started for
New England last season, leading the team in rushing with 896 yards and
eight touchdowns, but wasn't re-signed by the Patriots. Allen was selected
for the 1996 Pro Bowl while with the Washington Redskins and ranks fifth
among active players with 7,777 yards rushing.

35,"I've had lots of folks ask for more details on the story I reported Monday
night as Denver QB Brian Griese made my ""Downgrade"" list in the ""Upgrades /
Downgrade"" article.

According to John Clayton of ESPN, Griese's shoulder injury is a separation
of the AC joint in his right clavicle.  He took a pain killing shot and
finished the game.   Unfortunately, his status for this week's game against
San Diego is in doubt.  At this point, coach Mike Shanahan is saying it will
be a couple of days before they decide what they're doing.

I've copied the entire story below if you'd like more details.  Sounds like
this victory could be one of those career turning point games for him.
Griese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket
because he could hear the crowd hold it's breath is classic.  I'll keep an
eye on it for you as this shakes out.

Joe



From the article:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1114/876898.html
DENVER -- Brian Griese had a secret. Mike Shanahan knew because he was the
head coach. Griese knew because he had the pain piercing in the middle of
his right shoulder.
His teammates didn't know what went on behind closed doors in Monday's
dramatic 27-24 Broncos victory over the Raiders at Mile High Stadium. All
his teammates knew was that he had injured his right shoulder on an
ill-advised run out of bounds minutes into the first quarter.
Griese retreated to the locker room with a trainer but wasn't missed. The
Raiders had an 11-play, field-goal drive that lasted six minutes. Teammates
saw Griese trot back to the field, warm up and miss only five plays. They
didn't hear that Griese had separated his right clavicle and AC joint and
needed a pain-deadening shot to finish the final three quarters.
""This is not a game I wanted to miss, and I was going to do anything
possible to get in the game and help my team win,"" Griese said. ""I was going
to do it. It was just the will to play and the will to win, and I wasn't
going to come out.""
An hour after the game, Broncos players were surprised that the man who ran
their huddle had a busted wing. His performance was John Elway-like for
courage, but it also leaves the Broncos uncertain if they will have Griese
available as a starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the San Diego
Chargers.
""We won't know for a couple of days the exact extent of the injury, but he's
such a competitor,"" Shanahan said. ""He's been like that since he's been
here. He wants to play, and sometimes you have to be cautious to make sure
he doesn't further hurt himself. That's the kind of guy he is.""
Rod Smith is among the many Broncos who have grown to love this guy. Last
year was different. In the preseason, it was supposed to be Bubby Brister's
team, but Shanahan named Griese the starter. Veterans didn't feel totally
comfortable with him. Griese didn't feel comfortable bossing around a group
of players who didn't take to him.
""Brian's the one to lead us,"" Smith said. ""I think it would have hurt him
more just sitting there and watching rather than being out there playing
with the shoulder the way it was. Whatever he does, he doesn't surprise me.
He's the best quarterback in the NFL. I know the Raiders think Rich Gannon
is. We think Brian is.""
Griese told his offensive players that he didn't have too much zip on the
ball. They accepted it as just humility.
""I wasn't throwing the ball as well I have been,"" Griese said. ""Some of the
balls just died. At that point, it was just your will to play, your will to
win. I wasn't coming out of the game.""
Griese was 22-of-32 for 221 yards with a separated shoulder. He'd throw
passes and hear, as well as feel, his shoulder popping in and out.
""I knew there was something wrong with it, but they assured me that I
couldn't do any further damage,"" Griese said. ""It was just whether I could
handle the pain.""
Being injured didn't make Griese shy away from contact. Several times he
took shots from Raiders defenders that bounced him to the frozen Mile High
Stadium grass. Once, cornerback Eric Allen charged untouched from the
blindside. Griese ducked as Allen hit him shoulder high.
""Believe it or not, the reason I kind of ducked when he came in is that I
heard the crowd, and the crowd held their breath and I could hear that,""
Griese said. ""I said to myself, 'Well, somebody must be ready to hit me.' ""
Talk about homefield advantage. Griese has never had an injury like this. He
has played two seasons with a torn labrum problem in his shoulder that
requires surgery, but this was much more painful.
Griese remembered a pass to Rod Smith along the sideline that was a big
play. He had to make just an arm-through pass. It was agonizing. He threw a
skinny post to Ed McCaffrey that left McCaffrey vulnerable to a hit on the
chin.
""I apologized to him for that because the ball kind of floated on me and I
didn't have any zip on the ball,"" Griese said.
Griese said the feeling of his shoulder popping in and out was different.
""We knew it was something that was hurting him, we knew he was banged up,""
fullback Howard Griffith said. ""That's how it is when you've got a job to
do.""
Still, the story told after the game amazed them.

52,"What did you think of the debate?  I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job 
- mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool 
of himself.  Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  Do you think 
that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's 
tax cuts going to the ""wealthiest one percent"".   That is the biggest load of 
garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the 
math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to 
the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, 
obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.

Hi Folks,

Took a Power Nap after sending out our last update in week 17 and just woke
up... :)    Actually, I've been pouring myself into the ""other"" job (the one
that pays the bills and makes this one possible) getting ready for the boat
show season (www.bryantboats.com)  Also reintroduced myself to my wife and
kids.

I know you're busy with your own stuff but wanted to drop one more email in
your box this season and say thanks for letting us serve you this year at
Footballguys.com.  It's truly been a blast.  I can remember one night this
Summer as David and I were ""discussing"" (a nice word for ""yelling at each
other"") the VBD App on a Tuesday night about 4 am.  I looked at the clock
and said, ""We've got to be the dumbest guys in the world staying up all
night to do this"".  He paused and said, ""Yeah, but it's FUN, isn't it?""   I
had to agree it is.

I won't get sappy, but looking back on our season, it's pretty clear a lot
has happened since last Spring when we started mailing these updates.  In a
weird way, we sort of came through some of that stuff together.   That's
cool.

David and I have said all along that the strength of the site lies in the
people that visit and support it and we truly believe that.   Feedback from
you folks helped shape the site significantly.  Input / comments / death
threats from you greatly helped us in creating the VBD Draft App.  A large
number of our Breaking News Updates were stories that one of you sent me and
I'd in turn pass along to the 33,000+ people on the email list.  I tried to
operate on the philosophy of ""You'll Know What I Know"" sending you the
stories usually seconds after I received them.   Our message boards on the
site were another invaluable source for information and community.

Very simply: The site rocked because you guys rocked.

And for that, we wanted to say thanks for allowing us to be a small part of
your Fantasy Football Season.

Over the next several months, we'll be hammering out what improvements we
can make for 2002 and subscribers to this list will be the first to know
what's up.

Thanks again and we sincerely wish you and yours all the best in everything.

Joe and David

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.  

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, 
but don't expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid 
Fantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between 
two teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  

 Sylvester Morris , WR KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the 
Kansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. ""I 
missed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, 
but it's still a long season,"" he said. ""It's not so bad physically. But 
every morning I get up early, earlier than I ever had to in college. In 
college, you could schedule your classes. I never had a class before 10 
o'clock. Now I'm (at the practice facility) by 8 every day. That's a 
difference.""

 Player Updates?NBA Reports? 
 Latest NBA Player News 

 Jelani McCoy , C SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The elevation of Pervis Ellison to backup status has moved McCoy even 
further down in the Sonics' frontcourt rotation.  Head coach Paul Westphal 
decided to go with Ellison in hopes of preventing turnovers.  McCoy was 
behind former backup Ruben Wolkowyski but is now the last man in a 
five-player rotation.  McCoy is a good shot-blocker and a solid rebounder but 
his lack of offensive skills has hurt his push for playing time.       

 Pervis Ellison , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Ellison is questionable for Thursday's game at Charlotte due to a case of 
the flu.  He served as Ewing's backup in Wednesday's game at Miami.  ""Never 
Nervous"" Pervis entered the game at the end of the first quarter and promptly 
grabbed a rebound and scored.  He did not return after the first quarter, 
suffering from flu-like symptoms.    

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/09/00 
 Cummings will be out for at least a month after suffering  a fractured 
cheekbone.  He had plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone earlier this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will be the backup point guard in his absence.      

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Williams says he is ready to play in Thursday's game against Vancouver.  He 
missed Tuesday's game against the Lakers because of a sprained left knee.  He 
injured the knee when he landed awkwardly on it Sunday against Phoenix.  

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 McDyess played only 11 minutes in the second half of Wednesday's game 
against the Timberwolves due to a stiff back.  He finished the game with 11 
points.  This seems like it will be an ongoing situation with McDyess.  It is 
not known whether he will play in Thursday's game at Portland.  Monitor his 
situation closely.  

 Terry Porter , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 It appears that the cagey veteran is out of the Spurs' regular rotation.  
Porter has played a total of 24 minutes this season.  His minutes have 
gradually decreased since the start of the season and he hasn't played in the 
last two games.  It seems that Steve Kerr is now ahead of Porter in the 
rotation of reserve guards.    

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Reserve swingman Jaren Jackson is suffering from an ankle injury and is 
listed as day-to-day.  He sat out Wednesday's game against the Lakers.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Someone must have slipped ""The Man of Steel"" some kryponite before 
Wednesday's game against the Spurs.  Shaq grabbed 17 rebounds but only scored 
13 points.  He still put up decent Fantasy numbers but had a bad game in 
terms of points.  No need for Fantasy owners to panic, he should score easily 
in upcoming games against Denver and Houston.    

 Brian Grant , F MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Grant had a monster game against the Sonics Wednesday scoring 30 points and 
grabbing 21 rebounds.  He is doing his best to fill the void left in the 
middle by Alonzo Mourning.  So far Grant isn't doing a bad job, averaging 
20.0 points and 13.5 rebounds per game.    

 Desmond Mason , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Mason had four points in Seattle's 87-81 loss to the Heat Wednesday.  He 
beat out Brent Barry for the starting shooting guard job in the preseason but 
is averaging a mere 4.6 points per game and is shooting 32 percent from the 
field.  Barry is currently suffering from a sprained ankle and hasn't played 
yet this season but he may get his job back when he returns.     

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/09/00 
 Fortson continued his exceptional play this season by grabbing 14 rebounds 
and scoring 17 points against the Kings Wednesday.  He has exceeded the 
expectations of many this season averaging 15.8 points and 15.0 rebounds per 
game.  With numbers like that he is definitely a keeper in any Fantasy 
league.    

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Stojakovic continued his excellent play in the early part of the season by 
scoring 27 points in Wednesday's game.  He is averaging 18 ppg so far, a 
major increase from his 11.9 average in 1999-2000.    

 Jason Williams , G SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/09/00 
 Williams dazzled the Sacramento crowd and his opposition Wednesday by 
dishing out 12 assists in his first game back from a league induced 
suspension.  He was suspended for the first five games of the season for 
failing to comply with his drug treatment plan.  Williams appeared to be in 
great shape and is ready to be a Fantasy star this year.    

 Damon Jones , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Jones played in Wednesday's game at Dallas after suffering a concussion on 
Monday.  He scored five points and had three assists.    

 Chris Childs , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Childs left Wednesday's game against the Cavaliers with a bruised right 
hamstring.  He limped to the locker room with his leg heavily wrapped in 
ice.  No timetable on his return has been reported.    

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Gill left Wednesday night's game against the Wizards in the first half after 
feeling some pain in his knee. He has had a variey of injuries early in the 
season, including suffering a scratched cornea and dealing with back spasms. 
Despite the soreness in his knee, Gill doesn't expect to miss any court time, 
and should play in tonight's game against the Pistons.     

 Ben Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Wallace fell awkwardly on his left leg after being fouled by Sixers' forward 
George Lynch in Wednesday night's game.  He sat out the rest of the night as 
a precaution, but expects to be in the lineup tonight when the Pistons face 
off against the Nets.     

 Chris Herren , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Herren, who is due to come off the injury list this weekend, will start at 
point guard against Philadelphia on Saturday.  He has been sidelined with an 
ankle injury, which has caused him to miss Boston's first four games.  

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/08/00 
 The Hawks activated Mutombo from the injured list today, and he will play 
his first game of the season tomorrow night in Phoenix. He is now cured from 
a mild case of malaria and should help boost an Atlanta team that started 
0-5.  

 Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Barros, who has missed all four of Detroit's games this season because of a 
back injury, is reprortedly making good progress and could be back sooner 
than expected.  He has started running and is participating in shooting 
drills and scrimmages.     

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Harris is scheduled to dress for tonight's game in Washington, but is 
unlikley to see any action.  He is not  expected to be available to the team 
until Saturday.  

 Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Sura, sidelined with a strained lower back, is expected to return to the 
active roster after the Warriors conclude a four-game road trip on November 
19.  He did some light running with his team during practice Monday and hopes 
to begin practicing next week.     

 Ricky Davis , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Davis dribbled and shot on the side on Tuesday, but insists he won't be able 
to return to the team until December.  Head Coach Pat Riley said a decision 
could be made today as to whether or not Davis will need surgery to repair 
his injured foot.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/08/00 
 Sprewell is reportedly suffering from back spasm which may keep him out of 
tonight's game against the Cavaliers.  Sprewell is currently tied for second 
on the team in scoring, averaging 13.0 points per game.  

 Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 
 Ceballos was benched in Saturday's loss to the Bucks, and Head Coach George 
Irvine wouldn't say whether he would be back in the lineup tonight against 
the Sixers.  Irvine is reportedly fed up with Ceballos' lack of conditioning 
and defensive intensity.     

 Randy Brown , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Brown will start at the point for Boston until Kenny Anderson returns from a 
fractured jaw. In his first start, Brown finished with four assists, two 
rebounds and no points in a 30-point loss to the Raptors.    

 Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Hammonds is now eligible to be removed from the injury list.  Head coach 
Flip Saunders hasn't made a decision yet but said that among the players on 
the list Hammonds, who is suffering from sore ankles, is the only one healthy 
enough to play.    

 Tracy Murray , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Murray, last season's eighth-best three-point shooter has played sparingly 
for the Nuggets so far.  He played eight minutes in Monday's game against 
Dallas and got limited action in the season opener against Seattle.    

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 Buckner's injured right foot is getting better but it is still not known yet 
when he will be able to return.  He said he won't be out for no longer than a 
week but head coach Don Nelson stated that it could be two weeks.  Buckner is 
suffering from a sprained ligament in his right foot.  Hubert Davis and 
rookie Courtney Alexander have gotten extended playing time in his absence.   
 

 William Avery , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 
 With Chauncey Billups in town, Avery has gotten very little playing time for 
the Timberwolves so far this season.  He has appeared in two of the T'Wolves 
four games this season playing only two minutes.  Billups is starting at 
shooting guard and is being used the backup point guard as well.

New York Giant's Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne vs Rams  Defense?? The Rams have=

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jermaine Lewis , WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 With Travis Taylor now out for the season, expect Lewis to line up as the 
second wideout along with Qadry Ismail. Lewis assumed that spot in last 
Sunday's game against Cincinnati and caught four passes for 25 yards. He 
needs to perform well over the season's final weeks to be in the Ravens' 
receiving picture for 2001.  

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Pollard put up decent numbers in Sunday's game at Soldier Field against the 
Bears.  He caught three passes for 42 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss.    

 E.G. Green , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first game back in seven weeks, Green pulled in five passes for 45 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  He may see some increased playing time 
in the offense, and could even spend some time as the Colts' number two 
receiver in the offense.     

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/09/00 
 In his first productive game in weeks, Pathon caught three passes for 58 
yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Bears.  Pathon may see more 
looks in the offense in the coming weeks, as Head Coach Jim Mora looks to 
spread the ball around a bit more through the air.     

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dilger posted his second consecutive good outing for the Colts this weekend, 
catching five passes for 66 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss to the Bears at 
Soldier Field. He now has 36 receptions for 441 yards and three touchdowns on 
the season.     

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/09/00 
 James complied 117 yards of total offense and scored two touchdowns in last 
Sunday's 27-24 loss to the Bears.  He is now second in the league with 13 
touchdowns, one behind the Rams' Marshall Faulk. He could very well surpass 
Faulk this week against the Jets - he has scored at least one touchdown in 
each of his last four games.        

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 11/09/00 
 Christie kicked his second consecutive game-winning field goal for the Bills 
this week in New England.  He hit on a 48-yarder in the fourth quarter to 
send the game to overtime, then sealed the win with a 32-yard boot in the 
extra session. He kicked three field goals in all, and is now 20-of-23 in 
field goal attempts on the season.       

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 McDaniel caught only one pass for 24 yards in Sunday's game against the 
Patriots.  In spite of the poor performance, McDaniel is still second on the 
team in both receptions (27) and receiving yards (443).    

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/09/00 
 Price caught three passes for 36 yards in Sunday's win against the 
Patriots.  Although he is on pace to improve on all of his numbers from a 
year ago, Price has been a bust as far as Fantasy owners are concerned.    

 Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Bills' tight end had a solid Fantasy performance on Sunday, catching six 
passes for 49 yards and a touchdown.  Riemersma has historically had good 
success when Doug Flutie starts for the Bills, so keeping him in the lineup 
this week may be a good idea.     

 Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Baja Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith saw his first action in the last six weeks, but got only three carries 
for 13 yards in Sunday's game at Foxboro.  He won't get much playing time for 
the rest of the year, and will likely look to leave Buffalo at the end of the 
season.      

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries in Sunday's game  against  New 
England.  He ran the ball 13 times for 60 yards in Buffalo's 16-13 overtime 
victory.     

 Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Bradford isn't expected to play Sunday against Tampa Bay after injuring the 
quadriceps muscle near his right knee. The Packers will probably sit Bradford 
and give him time to rest. He is just getting in shape after missing seven 
games this season because of a broken leg. Donald Driver will probably take 
his place as the third receiver.    

 Ahman Green , RB GB - FIBSABs Updated 11/09/00 
 Dorsey Levens had arthropscopic surgery on his injured knee Tuesday so Green 
will likely be the starting back for the rest of the season.  He has played 
well in 2000 gaining 474 yards and scoring four touchdowns.  Green still has 
a penchant for fumbling, and has done so three times this season, but he 
managed to hold on to the ball in a rainy game vs. Minnesota Monday.     

 Titans , DT TEN - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 It's highly likely that Tennessee's defense is on a roster in every Fantasy 
league, but you might want to look into acquiring it in a trade for the 
remainder of the season. The Titans' D has four games against some of the 
league's youngest quarterbacks over its final seven games - Spergon Wynn of 
Cleveland twice, and Akili Smith of Cincinnati and Donovan McNabb of 
Philadelphia once.   

 Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Howard is expected to play in Sunday's game against Atlanta.  He sat out 
last week's matchup against the Dolphins due to a neck injury.    

 Derrick Mason , WR TEN - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 Receiver and kick returner Mason practiced yesterday despite suffering from 
ankle and back injuries. He is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury 
report for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Sanders was able to practice with the Titans yesterday, and didn't appear to 
be suffering from any effects from a rib cartilage strain that knocked him 
from last Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Tennessee will rely on him if 
Carl Pickens or Yancey Thigpen can't play Sunday against Baltimore.  

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Edinger is finally beginning to settle into the job as the Bears' 
placekicker.  He made 4-of-8 field goals to start the season but has 
connected on his last seven field-goal attempts, including kicks of 41 and 37 
yards last Sunday. Edinger is now 11-of-15 for the season, including 4-of-7 
from beyond the 40.     

 Yancey Thigpen , WR TEN - FIBSABs Updated 11/09/00 
 Thigpen got a second opinion Tuesday about his injured left ankle, which 
confirmed that he has a condition that will hamper him for the rest of the 
season. He received an injection and was able to practice comfortably 
yesterday, and looks to be on the mend. We'll keep tabs on Thigpen's status 
for Sunday's game against Baltimore.  

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Eric Bass Updated 11/09/00 
 Robinson is on the verge of surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the second 
consecutive season.  Robinson has made seven of the Bears' eight longest 
plays from scrimmage this season, including all five of his touchdown 
receptions. He has catches of 68, 58, 55 and 48 yards from Cade McNown and a 
34-yard TD pass from Jim Miller.   

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Klap Updated 11/09/00 
 Pickens missed yesterday's practice with his hamstring injury, and the 
Titans are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards his status. He is still 
sore and appears unlikely to post good numbers even if he does play.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Although George was unable to practice yesterday due to a toe injury, Coach 
Jeff Fisher says he would have participated some had the session been 
conducted on grass instead of artificial turf. George is expected to play 
Sunday against Baltimore, although keep in mind that the Ravens have the 
NFL's top-ranked rush defense.  

 Scott Dragos , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Dragos is still suffering from an injured quadriceps and is questionable for 
Sunday's game at Buffalo.  He played a major role as a blocker for James 
Allen when Curtis Enis was inactive.  With Enis back the Bears don't need 
Dragos as much for blocking but may use him as their long snapper.  Regular 
long snapper Pat Mannelly has an injured elbow and is questionable for 
Sunday's game as well.    

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Smith was limited in practice because of his hamstring and knee injuries, 
but he will return to action Sunday against Seattle. Smith missed 
Jacksonville's last game October 29 against Dallas, but was able to rest over 
the bye week last week.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/09/00 
 McNown is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game at Buffalo.  Head coach Dick 
Jauron said that McNown may be used as the emergency QB if his seperated left 
shoulder continues to improve this week.      

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 11/09/00 
 The Jaguars will be without linebacker Hardy Nickerson, who underwent 
arthroscopic knee surgery last Friday, for Sunday's game against Seattle. 
Linebackers Lonnie Marts and Brant Boyer, both suffering from groin injuries, 
are listed as questionable on the injury report. Eric Storz and Kevin Hardy 
would be the likely replacements if neither can play. Defensive end Renaldo 
Wynn practiced yesterday and may return to action Sunday after missing four 
games with a torn MCL in his right knee. Defensive tackle Gary Walker will 
play after missing Jacksonville's last game against Dallas October 29.  

 Derek Brown , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The Cardinals re-signed Brown on Wednesday after tight end Jay Tant was lost 
for the season with a torn ACL.  Brown had played for the Cardinals since 
1992 but was cut before the start of this season.      

 Jay Tant , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Tant tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during last 
Sunday's 16-15 win against the Redskins.  He will miss the remainder of the 
season.   

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Patten, who has played sparingly the past three weeks with a turf toe 
injury, is listed as doubtful on the Browns' injury report. He missed 
practice yesterday and is unlikely to make any Fantasy impact Sunday against 
New England.

105,"Thank you for keeping us in the loop on this.  D&B data will become one of 
our most important sources.  As you suggest, the intent is to use this data 
along with other available date to generate a price for credit.  The price 
will be published externally (likely for a fee and as a free service) via the 
web or via automated processes.  

Option 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to 
date data as possible.  Stuart is working with the credit team to define 
additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely 
what we are looking for.  Alternatively, if it is possible to obtain the 
actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to 
generate our own score in addition to D&B's.  We will need the Global Failure 
Score as well.  Currently we are active in Europe as well as the US and 
expect to move towards Asia and Austrailia over time.  Hopefully, this data 
is available via D&B Connect.

Another consideration is the term of contract.  We would likely prefer a 
longer term contract so that if they decide they don't like what we are doing 
with the data, we cannot be cut off.  Does it make sense from your 
perspective to approach D&B to be our long term, strategic providor of 
customer data.  This would likely make their deal maker look good in his 
boss's eyes, give you lot's of negotiating ability and give a us the long 
term preferential contract that we are looking for.

Let's discuss further.

108,"Tuesday - 10:00 to 12:00 - is the all-employee meeting at the Hyatt.  Given negative publicity over the last several days and the dramatic market reaction (stock price today down to $20), the meeting tomorrow should be well attended and I would expect that the questions will be quite candid.  MD's had a meeting this morning with Lay, Whalley and Frevert, and we made suggestions on what should be covered in the all-employee meeting.  

I have dropped out of my recruiting trip to Oklahoma tomorrow so that I can be present at the Hyatt meeting.  Since Mark and Greg are both travelling, I think that it is important to both Ken Lay and employees for us to have a visible prescence at the meeting.  As a follow up, I am pulling together a group of senior leaders within ENW at noon for an informal lunch (in the conference room without door handles!). We will discuss what we heard at the all-employee meeting and how to anticipate employee questions and deal with the possibililty of low morale.  I will stress the importance of visible, consistant leadership at this time, and will ask all to do their part on this.  I discussed this with Greg Piper this morning, and he suppports this effort.

Who do you want to have attend the lunch folllow-up meeting?  I need to send a note ASAP today to get this on everyone's calendar.

113,"The following e-mail is to confirm my understanding of the following verbal assurances provided to me as part of the intent and conditions for signing a contingent employment agreement/retention package related to the sale of the Enron gas and power trading business (""Enron trading business"") to a new entity.

If a new entity purchases the Enron trading business and the contingent employment agreement executed on January 5, 2002 becomes a valid and binding agreement, Enron's management will not initiate a lawsuit to recover the 2001 performance bonus payments.
Enron and/or purchaser of the Enron trading business will seek approval from the bankruptcy judge of the 2001 performance bonus payments to eliminate any future uncertainty with respect to the validity of those payments.
To the extent the total retention $'s available for the Enron trading business employees is increased above current levels (from the leading bidder as of January 5, 2002), the intent of Enron's senior management is to make an upward adjustment to the individual employees who have committed to the new entity such that the employee maintains a substantially similar percentage of the total ""pool"" of retention $'s.

131,"Guys, look at the attached draft of a letter I plan on sending to the Laguna 
pueblo regarding Transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to 
address and remove PCB contamination from the groundwater at the facility.

You may remember, we had a meeting in January to hear the Laguna's concerns 
that Transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site.  This 
letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that 
remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively 
at the site given the sites unique characterisstics.  Id like to send this 
out on Friday or Monday.

133,"Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits 
which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most 
critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really 
restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.  
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me 
know what additional information you may need. 


1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest
Operations.

2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based
on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.  At 60F
and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all
operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as 
high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.

The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of
the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20%
of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of
reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.  The potential
to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of
lb/hr and ton/yr.  These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA
for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA
Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd
values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that
under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the
emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is
requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows
emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that
the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.

3. The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires
Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not
normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel
monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or
gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the
natural gas.",Roger Klagetoh Luepp Danny Pribble Transwestern,,"Transwetern NOx and CO VP Southwest

151,"Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms 


(Published April 4, 2001) 
There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that 
envelops California's energy crisis. 
Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control 
and the die is more or less cast. Whatever fate decrees - massive summer 
blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's 
utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov. Gray Davis downward are 
scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals 
for blame. 
No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very 
apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with 
energy and moved to other matters. Legislative committees are working on the 
hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special 
committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis 
have gone into semihibernation. 
Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears 
that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will 
backfire. ""Just remember Jimmy Carter,"" state Controller Kathleen Connell 
warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have ""no excuses"" for 
perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly. ""We will be 
accountable on Election Day 2002,"" she said. 
Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a 
second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined 
sharply in recent weeks. He devoted much of the weekend to defending his 
actions, saying, ""I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this 
problem,"" and trying to pin blame on Republicans. 
Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape 
from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses 
in the last three elections. The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder, 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of 
mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill 
Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis 
Davis. 
The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every 
sign of worsening. Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled 
""Meeting the Energy Challenge"" to defend the governor's actions, it's 
apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit. 
The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power 
purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into 
a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves. The 
long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases 
have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for 
them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float. 
Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase 
market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a 
deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit. 
Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the 
state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall 
Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power 
generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission 
grid have stalled, perhaps permanently. 
The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the 
specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air 
conditioners or medical equipment shut down. And the utilities are closer to 
bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis. 
Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy. With 
Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to 
protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH SDG&E, SEMPRA ENERGY
$400-$12,000 Per Customer Balloon Payment Eliminated, No Additional Rate
Increases Required to Pay Off Undercollection
SACRAMENTO
Governor Gray Davis today announced an agreement with San Diego Gas &
Electric and the utility's parent company, Sempra Energy, that will erase a
$747 million balloon payment facing the utility's three million customers.
""The balloon is burst,"" Governor Davis said. ""Under this agreement, the
undercollection is eliminated, without any increase in rates. This is a
massive benefit to the San Diegans, the first Californians to bear the brunt
of our state's energy crisis last summer.""
The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), signed by the Department of Water
Resources for Gov. Davis with Sempra Energy and SDG&E executives while a
group of San Diego ratepayers, and State Senators Steve Peace (D-El Cajon)
and Dede Alpert (D-Coronado) looked on, includes a number of provisions to
eliminate the undercollection that could have cost each customer
approximately $750 (as much as $400 for each residential customer, $1,400
for each small-commercial customer and $12,000 for each medium-sized
commercial customer).
In addition, it would settle several regulatory cases before the California
Public Utilities Commission (PUC), gives the State the opportunity to
purchase 15,780 acres of environmentally-sensitive lands owned by the
company along the Colorado River, and provides below-market power to the
State through December 2010 from the San Onofre nuclear power plant. The
regulatory provisions are subject to PUC approval.
It also calls for the purchase of SDG&E's transmission lines for
approximately $1 billion, or 2.3 times book value. However, the deal is not
contingent on that purchase of SDG&E's transmission network, which includes
170 electric lines exceeding 69 kilovolts in capacity and spans
approximately 1,800 circuit miles from southern Orange County to the Mexican
border. The system also includes about 135 electric substations and
transmission interties with Southern California Edison's system at the San
Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
""Throughout these long and complex negotiations, Governor Davis and we have
had the mutual objective of reducing the financial impact of California's
crisis on SDG&E's customers and helping the State gain more control over its
energy destiny,"" said Stephen L. Baum, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of Sempra Energy. ""Today's agreement represents a winning
proposition for our customers, the State and our company: it reduces the
future financial burden on our customers, protects the State's economic
future, and creates a clear path for future growth and profitability for our
company. Going forward, we are committed to working with Governor Davis and
the State to implement his recovery plan.""
The MOU signed today is the second with California's investor-owned
utilities. An agreement with Southern California Edison is pending approval
before the State Legislature. Unlike the Edison agreement, however, the MOU
with Sempra Energy does not need legislative approval (except for the
acquisition of transmission lines).
""This is an example of the good that can come when parties are responsible
and remain at the bargaining table,"" Governor Davis said. ""This is a
balanced business transaction that benefits ratepayers and provides a stable
environment for the State's third largest utility.""
Governor Davis said the MOU will not result in any additional
electric-base-rate increases for SDG&E customers to recover the $750 million
undercollection. Without the MOU, future balloon payments to recover this
sum could have been as much as $750 per customer.
The regulatory balancing account for SDG&E's undercollected power costs had
grown to approximately $750 million since September 2000, when the State
imposed a retail rate cap of 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, retroactive to May
2000. California state law AB 265, signed by Governor Davis last year,
provided for SDG&E's recovery of all its prudently incurred power costs, but
delegated responsibility to the PUC for determining the method and timeline
for recovery.
The agreement includes a complex package of elements to eliminate the
balloon payment, such as the settlement of the reasonableness-review case
SDG&E had with the PUC. To settle that case, the utility has agreed to
forego collecting $100 million of the balancing account.
In addition, the agreement notes that:
SDG&E agrees to give back 90 percent of the profits on two long-term power
contracts earned since the energy crisis flared last June. That means SDG&E
will forego collecting another $219 million in the balancing account. (The
California Department of Water Resources will purchase those contracts as of
June 1.);
SDG&E and its sister utility, SoCalGas, will invest at least $3 billion over
six years into capital improvements. In addition, if the State decides not
buy the transmission lines (and
SDG&E builds the Valley Rainbow line) the utility, backed by Sempra Energy,
will put another $500 million into transmission line improvements, subject
to PUC approval). Excluding the transmission system improvements, this is an
increase of $600 million more than the utilities invested in capital
improvements in the previous five years; and
SDG&E will drop all legal claims against the State.
""We know that many of our customers are extremely concerned about the
potential of large balloon payments looming in the future to address our
past undercollections,"" said Edwin A. Guiles, group president of Sempra
Energy's regulated business units and chairman of SDG&E. ""We are pleased
that today's agreement provides the framework to resolve major regulatory
issues to the benefit of our customers. Many challenges remain, but, this
agreement demonstrates that, by working together, we can surmount these
challenges in a way that benefits all the key stakeholders in California's
energy future.""
The MOU also calls for the Department of Water Resources (DWR) to continue
to buy power for SDG&E through the agency until certain conditions are met.
DWR has been purchasing power for SDG&E customers since early February.
SDG&E is a regulated utility operating in San Diego and southern Orange
counties. Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE), based in San Diego, is a Fortune 500
energy services holding company with annualized 2001 revenues of about $13
billion. Through its eight principal subsidiaries - Southern California Gas

US Senate rejects California utility bankruptcy measure
By Patrick Connole

WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday rejected a bid 
to force California utility companies to repay power generators for 
electricity they bought under a federal government sales order, even if 
utilities go bankrupt.

In a motion on the Senate floor, lawmakers killed an amendment to a broader 
bankruptcy reform bill that opponents said was a dangerous proposal that 
would have opened the door to involuntary bankruptcy filings by troubled 
California utilities. The utilities in question are PG&E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG - 
news) Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International's (NYSE:EIX - news) 
Southern California Edison.

The amendment was sponsored by Oregon Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden, Montana 
Democrat Sen. Max Baucus and Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith.

Proponents said the measure would have protected the customers of the 
federally-owned Bonneville Power Administration and other Northwest utilities 
from unfair rate increases due to the California energy crisis.

``I don't think it's fair for consumers in other Western states to get caught 
holding the bag if California utilities take our power and then run into 
bankruptcy court to avoid their debts,'' Wyden said.

``The Northwest has been more than a good neighbor to California during this 
crisis,'' he said.

Interestingly, the California Senate delegation was split on the matter. 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein opposed the amendment, while fellow Democrat 
Barbara Boxer supported it.

Feinstein called the proposal a ``dangerous amendment'' that would create two 
classes of creditors and ``probably force an involuntary bankruptcy.''

The broader bankruptcy reform bill is expected to be approved by the Senate 
by the end of the week.

Separately, talks between California and its three investor owned utilities 
on a deal under which the state might buy their transmission assets continued 
this week with no deal in sight.

The state is negotiating with PG&E and Edison, along with Sempra Energy 
(NYSE:SRE - news) unit San Diego Gas and Electric.

The deals are aimed mainly at pumping money into PG&E and SoCal Edison to 
keep them out of bankruptcy after they recorded about $13 billion in red ink 
since last spring, paying sky-high prices for power in the wholesale market.

PG&E and SoCal Edison, under the terms of the state's disastrous experiment 
with market deregulation, have been able to pass on to their retail customers 
only a fraction of their power purchase costs.

in addition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state, price caps, 
and the uncertainty surrounding them, chase new generation away.  The turbine 
market is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their 
own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in 
jurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other 
than the operation of the market.  Several generators, including Dynegy and 
Calpine, have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have

The Haas Entrepreneur Association in conjunction with the Lester Center for
Entrepreneurship is pleased to bring you the opportunity to meet and network
with venture capital professionals at the annual VC Roundtable Dinner.

Details are below:
VC Roundtable Dinner
Monday, November 6 from 6:30pm - 9 pm
Mings Restaurant in Palo Alto

WHAT IS THE VC ROUNDTABLE?
An opportunity to meet and network with 20+ venture capitalists from both
early stage and late stage firms. We have already received great interest
from a number of VCs who attended last year. To give you an idea of the
event, a list of the attendees from last year is attached below. The
planned format for this event will be pre-dinner drinks with all the VC
representatives. You will then have the opportunity to have dinner with 2
VC professionals and approximately 7of your MBA classmates (exact number to
depend on final confirmations). During dinner, you will rotate tables so
that you can meet with 2 more VC professionals in an intimate setting.

HOW DO I SIGN UP FOR THIS EVENT?
The cost for this event, which includes dinner, will be $25 per person*. Due
to limited space, invitations will be given on a first-come, first serve
basis (defined by submitting the check for $25) . We do not plan to
organize transport to the
restaurant, but highly recommend carpooling depending on your location.
*Please note that the cost of the event is to partially subsidize dinner,
which is also partly funded by your membership dues.

We would also ask that each attendee submit a short bio (no more than one
page please) to distribute to the VCs in advance. This will also help us to
match you with VCs who have similar interests/backgrounds at the event. This
bio should address what you feel is most relevant with regard to the 
following:
1. A bit of personal background (undergrad institution/major, industries
you've worked in, and anything else about your background you feel is
relevant)
2. Why you are interested in VC?
3. Do you have a particular industry or sector of interest?
4. Do you have a business plan that you want to pitch to a VC? If so, in
what industry/sector? (Again this is to help us place you at tables. You
probably don't want to be pitching your radical new b2b idea to a a VC
interested in biotech research.)

Please let us know by replying to this e-mail whether you would like to
attend this event. We will confirm your attendance once we receive payment
for $25. Please make your check out to 'UC Regents' and put it in Nitin
Chellaram's mailbox in the MBAA lounge (you will find the mailbox under
'Exchange Students').

We will need your $25 payment, your firm commitment to attend and your bio
(in Word format) by 16th October. Additional details will be sent out
following your confirmation for this event.

175,"PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts 
Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Wednesday, March 21, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M
N33580.DTL 
Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other 
alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a 
proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening. 
A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward 
energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates. 
Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which 
would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who 
requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities 
that buy their power return to solvency. 
Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for 
not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or 
""QFs"" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates. 
""It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the 
money designed to compensate the QFs,"" Davis said. ""It's immoral and has to 
stop."" 
Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil 
refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's 
supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not 
paid them since November. 
The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers 
contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday, 
according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power 
grid. 
The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday 
meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract 
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. 
The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more 
than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor 
one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings 
from other creditors. 
The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work. 
""It is critical to keep these facilities up and online,"" said Sen. Debra 
Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash 
on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. ""The utilities owe it to the people of the 
state to pay them."" 
Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative 
producers ahead of their other creditors. 
But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes 
alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the 
governor's office about possible payment structures. 
Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural 
gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash 
they must close their plants. 
""We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten 
the health of everyone else,"" said V. John White, legislative director of the 
Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers. 
CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the 
Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility 
asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with 
Edison which has paid them nothing since November. 
CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes 
the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day. 
""We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in 
a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest 
employer in the county,"" said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager. 
Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar. 
""We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet 
delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs 
to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen 
rates,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. 
The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators 
comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for 
legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations 
eventually failed to move forward.

179,"FYI. The California AG has announced that he is investigating conflict of interest charges against consultants who were involved with arranging DWR's long term power contracts. May be part of Davis' attempt to ""re-negotiate"" the contracts.  There's been some assertions that, under California law, any contracts negotiated by consultants with financial conflict of interests must be nullified.",Davis,,FYI The California AG DWR

And I'm really sorry that I couldn't be there for her today, but the Enron thing is really a mess and I've got responsibilities on that front that I just can't pass off.

205,"Ike, given our schedules, it appears that e-mail may be the most effective 
communication tool.  

I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our 
settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of 
communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I 
have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the 
larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm 
pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have 
suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both 
TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are 
going.  

Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.

5) Available for TF-1 or TF-2 transportation service.  TF-2 service 
will not be discounted below Northwest's current Tariff filed rate

happens if our max rates are reduced and what happens if our rate design is 
modified.  As to the old confidentiality paragraph and some of the other

231,"Per our discussion last week, this is the status on Pueblo.  I think we need 
to establish to our satisfaction the bona fides of Dennis' government 
contracting scheme before we pitch hard to have ENA get into the deal and 
scrub down the numbers on the power plant.  If our govcon gurus (Bill Votaw 
and Bill Gang--both ex military guys working on DOD outsourcing deals for 
Enron Federal Solutions) buy off on it, then I think we brief Stan at that 
point.  You, Stan and Steve will then need to decide the best way to pitch 
ENA to verify the economics and potentially get into the deal.  Either we'd 
have Stan push from the top down or have Kevin and  Steve go directly to the 
ENA deal guys.  More to follow.

233,"The Commission accepted and suspended Northern's SLA filing to be effective 
December 1, subject to refund and other conditions, including Northern's 
providing additional documentation.  Specifically, the Commission denied the 
requests for rejection of Northern's filing and request for consolidation 
with Northern's Order No. 637 proceeding.  However, the Commission concluded 
that  Northern's filing lacked adequate documentation and is requesting 
Northern to provide the following documentation within 21 days of the Order:

1.  A narrative explanation and work papers containing detailed calculations 
supporting the derivation of all numerical values included in the attachments 
to its filing, including rates, allocations, load factor calculations and 
billing determinants.

2.  A narrative explanation and all calculations which Northern needs to 
recalculate the rate impact of the return and tax components associated with 
the SLA .

3.  Documentation including commodity prices and accounting entries for both 
the SLA and the cash imbalance mechanism showing how the SLA balance changed 
each month during the 2nd adjustment period (period ending March 31, 2000) as 
a result of activity related to the cash imbalance mechanism and how each 
monthly value of the cash imbalance mechanism was determined. 

The parties have 21 days to comment on Northern's additional data.  The 
Commission anticipates that with such additional documentation, the issues 
raised in this proceeding could be resolved on the merits without the need 
for additional administrative procedures.  The Commission further stated that 
Northern need not provide information related to the SLA balance for the 
period after March 31, 2000.  

I will forward a copy of the Order as soon as I receive it.  thanks, Maria",Maria,,"Northern SLA Commission The

246,"NNG is billing fuel retention on out-of-balance deliveries.

We only collect the 4.5% on the receipt volumes, however NNG is charging fuel based on the receipt plus the out-of-balance delivery.
This out of balance collection goes to trackers.  We could lower the amounts over the 4.5% if NNG stops charging out-of-balance retention when this contract goes short.  (stop charging out-of-balance retention has other problems assocated with it). This contract was consistently short in 2001.  This is not all of the problem but it is the controllable part.  That is, we need to make these two contracts long to the system each month.  Or, put an OBA at Bushton's inlet (The OBA at Bushton's inlet also has other problems assocated with it).

Mike and Steve please confirm my calculations to the contract terms to see if I am correct, also can you set a meeting with Logistics, Regulatory and Tracy Geaccone to discuss. 

The non-controllable factors are NNG's Field fuel rate keeps increasing making it consistently over the 4.5%, and lower gas prices increase the exposure to EPPI.

Techies work for these companies for 6 months and then Enron may or may not

260,"The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for  08/31 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets
labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\Aug_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

272,"This is not the regular email, that will come in a day or so,
and it will have all of the regular info, and the tailgate
information for the BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME!!!!!

Tickets
Let's talk about the game for a second. I'm sure you can imagine
the demand for tickets. The Big XII allots 16,500 tickets to be
divided among both schools, or 8,250 each. Cut 10% out of that
for the student draw, and it's down to 7,425. That's 7,425 tickets
for around 70,000 people looking to be in Dallas this weekend.
The 7,425 should raise some when Colorado doesn't sell all of
theirs (they usually don't), so that should push it up to 11,000
or so. That's 11,000 seats for around 40,000 people. These tickets
will be prioritized and dealt out as usual.You should know if you
are one of those who get select tickets or if you do not. If you
do, you should contact the Longhorn Foundation (ticket reservations
started on at 10:00 am on Sunday, November 25 and it ends at 7:00 pm
on Monday, November 26). If you are not one of these people, there
are options: School message boards, ticket vendors/outlets, want ads
in Norman and Lincoln, and most isp's have some sort of on-line
shopping sites where people sell any and everything. Believe me, I
have looked, tickets are EVERYWHERE on the Internet. Start with the
Longhorn links and work your way to the OU and NU sites, the ticket
outlets and on to the buy/sell sites and you will find them.

The Game
This is it folks. It may not have happened exactly like it was
supposed to, but what ever does? It's right there in front of
the Longhorns, and now they need to reach out and grab it. They
need your help. COME TO DALLAS. From the players, the coaches,
the Athletic Department- COME TO DALLAS. When CU came to town in
October, the game was close until the shovel pass. After that,
the crowd took over. Life was unbearable for the Buffalos after
that: they couldn't audible, they had false starts, delay of
games, etc... and they got blown out. That was the crowd. Dallas
is our town, this our state, Texas Stadium is OUR house. The Buffs
are the visitors in OUR HOUSE. Let's make it a Burnt Orange Dallas.
An endless sea of Texas shirts and hook'em horns, and a thundering
stream of noise to let the Buffalos know we mean business down
here in Austin. Let's turn Texas Stadium into the DKR-North.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. Who knows, by the time the game kicks off,
Florida or Miami may have lost, and you could be watching the
Longhorns celebrate Mack Brown's 1st Big XII Championship as the
players carry roses around and the crowd goes crazy in anticipation
of the National Championship game in Pasadena. Get yourself to
Dallas. It's right there.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. DKR-NORTH. OUR HOUSE.

Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

We are currently experiencing server connectivity issues with Deal Blotter's 
blotter server when using your local version of Enpower.  Until this problem 
is resolved, Deal Blotter will only be accessible through Terminal Server.  I 
will send a follow-up email as soon as this issue is resolved or when an ETA 
has been determined.

something last week was because I got a settlement on my some of my dads 
insurance shit and I wanted to go out to a nice dinner.  I thought it would 
be a nice opportunity for us to hang out and catch up.  I hope you don't 
still think that I didn't want to see you that night because you are dating

that they would be unable to supply their day ahead schedules due to a crack

ahead schedules for Wednesday either as it appears to be a problem which may 
take some time to fix.  To cover the day ahead schedules we looked for power 
to cover it in SP however we could not find even an offer during the night 
shift.  I would advise Les and whomever is on the day and night shifts on 
Tuesday to keep in touch with Harbor regarding this issue.  Thank you for 
your attention to this matter and if you should have any questions please

306,"Hey dave.  I have a night shift tonight so thats why I am not getting back 
to  you until now.   Regarding Thanksgiving I have the 18th through the 23rd 
off. It is one of those six day breaks i was telling you about.  So this 
saturday (18th) I am going to the Civil War (Uof O vs. OSU) footbal game.  I 
am way fired up about it.  It should be a great time.  Then on Sunday 
afternoon I will be flying in to Orange County at 3:30pm and will be down 
there through Thursday evening when I will be flying back home at 6:30.  
Unfortunately I have to work the Friday after thanksgiving but at least I 
will be able to spend thanksgiving day  and most of the week with all of 
you.  I am going to be staying at my mothers house for the week.  Maybe 
Sunday evening we can all have dinner together or something after i get in.  
Anyway looking forward to seeing all of you.  I should be able to come down 
again for Christmas as I have the 24th through the 29th off.

beavs!  If we win and Washington loses we go to the Rose Bowl  Take Care and 
see you this weekend!",dave,,OSU footbal

sorry I didnt return them but I was just entirely to busy and recieved too

well for you.  We will have to get together and grab a bite to eat or a beer 
or something this week.  How was your weekend?",,,

thanksgiving.  I have a six day break right around then and I think it would

340,"One of our buds at Mission advises that they intend to ""perform strictly to 
contract"" on  our Confirm #1 ending May 31, then claim us in default and 
cancel any tons not shipped.  Mission then intend to be the customer from 
hell on the second confirm for shipments through June 2001.  

Mission was less then enthusiastic about our offer of USD 13.7 mm to buy down 
the contract.  Instead they obviously intend to frustrate the contract 
through non-performance by virtue of a strict interpretation of their 
obligation to accept..

My thought is to go to them with a ""no harm - no foul"" settlement that  will 
cancel the balance of the tons under the first confirm, waive any claims we 
have due to vessel demurrage, extra handling costs, them being jerks, etc. in 
return for a blanket bilateral agreement that neither of us has any claims 
against the other for deliveries made under Confirm #1.  In return they agree 
to accept certain minimum levels of tonnage on a weekly basis at their 
stations under Confirm #2, and promise to play nice in the future.

This would allow us to mark the LBT ""over charge"" we are holding of about USD 
8 mm now gathering dust, and will give us a pretty good reason to mark the 
forward ""over charge"" for LBT shipments to be made against Confirm #2.

Mission will think they are screaming studs - having knocked us to our knees, 
while in reality we walk away with their money.  Sounds like a win-win to 
me.  Also sounds like something we need to pass by you lawyer types.

failed to fix a just and reasonable rate, (2) FERC did not remove the ongoing 
prohibition on the IOUs trading in its markets, (3) the January 8 order 
prohibited it from operating a spot market and that prohibition was unduly 
discriminatory, and (4) FERC failed to provide a viable alternative to its

In fact, everything published to http://www.westlaw.com and

the right answer elsewhere for free, or for short money using TheLaw.net. Why 
is this significant and why would we advertise our competitors?

Simple. For years, the management question has been whether to make that 
onerous annual commitment to Company A or Company B. But thanks to the 
Internet, you can have just what you need, at the precise time you need it on 
a pay-per-view basis. Choosing the right tool for the job is the trick. But 
that's easy once you know your options.


--USEFUL BELLS AND WHISTLES OR TEDIOUS OVERKILL?

TheLaw.net Custom Browser lacks some of Wexis' bells and whistles. For 
instance, using our meta-searchable database of four million plus Federal and 
state appellate judicial opinions, you can quickly call up a relevant list of 
cases that have construed the statute, rule, reg or cite that you need to 
learn more about. It is just as easy to quickly jump to the relevant excerpt 
of each case to assess relevancy. What's missing are the little colored 
arrows indicating whether a Court followed or distinguished your case.

For some, the lack of every conceivable enhancement can be a deal breaker. 
Others, however, prefer to draw their own conclusions by checking cases for 
themselves because at some point in their career something happened which 
caused them to question whether the best lawyers are the ones still writing 
headnotes. Depending on the job at hand, the mind numbing array of costly, 
high falutin' Wexis icons and symbols scattered throughout a document, may be 
very useful or very confusing and unnecessary.


--THE INTERNET: AN INCUBATOR FOR CHOICE

We advertise our competitors because we recognize that Wexis has been a work 
in progress for generations and we know that you will probably always have a 
relationship with them at some level; subscription, pay-per-view, or 
otherwise. Certainly, factors such as practice area, jurisdiction, 
organization size and culture all contribute to assembling what is, for you, 
the best matrix of tools for the job. Far be it from us to say precisely 
where we fit in. This, by definition, is an individualized decision only you 
can make as a sophisticated consumer of information services. Experience

California Update: Duke Energy Proposes Settlement Deal 

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE][IMAGE]Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) approached Calif. Gov. Gray Davis with 
a secret deal, now made public, that offered monetary concessions if the 
state drops lawsuits and investigations into the company's alleged price 
gouging. Duke made the offer in a secret 17-page letter sent in April to Gov. 
Davis' office, which the governor confirmed on May 2. Davis' spokesman called 
the letter Duke's ""wish list,"" which included having the state call off 
investigations of the North Carolina-based generator. Although Gov. Davis has 
acknowledged receipt of the proposal, he has not officially accepted or 
rejected the offer. 

Analysis: Duke's desire to make a settlement with the state of California 
stems from an ongoing investigation by FERC that began back in March. At that 
time, FERC put 13 California power sellers, including Duke, on notice that 
they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further 
justification for their prices. Duke is considered to be one of four 
companies (along with Dynegy, Reliant and Williams) that faces the biggest 
potential refunds to the state of California. In fact, Duke reportedly faces 
potential refunds of up to $20 million for the power that it has sold to 
California since the start of this year. 

We can fast forward from FERC's investigation to Duke's ""good faith"" 
settlement offer that now sits before Gov. Gray Davis. The plan sets out 
specific action steps for new generation, conservation programs, electric and 
gas infrastructure improvements, regional transmission frameworks, and 
environmental goals. In addition, Duke has offered an undisclosed settlement 
agreement, for which the California government would agree to cease all 
ongoing investigations of price manipulation by the company. Duke's 
""appropriate payment"" is based on fair estimate of the company's alleged 
overcharges for power that it sold to the state.  

Yet, beyond the spin control surrounding this offer, Duke's proposal amounts 
to a mutual back-scratching agreement, with Duke clearly obtaining the 
largest benefit. Duke wants the state to drop all pending lawsuits that 
allege price gouging and tone down the negative public comments against Duke 
made by the governor and others. In return, Duke will refund to the state 
some of the money that it allegedly owes and will further assist in helping 
the state with its power supply needs. However, under the offer Duke will 
admit no wrongdoing. Rather, the company's proposal is being presented as an 
altruistic effort to assist in the resolution of California's flawed market. 
Neither Duke nor Gov. Davis has disclosed the monetary amount of Duke's 
settlement offer, but it is fairly safe to assume that it is only a fraction 
of the $20 million that the state wants. 

Other specifics within Duke's proposal that are important to note include the 
company's ""commitment to work with the state to get 680 MW of additional 
peaking capacity ready for summer 2002."" In addition, Duke has offered to 
enter into long-term contracts with the state on ""reasonable terms"" and also 
""attempt to secure other reasonably priced electricity for the state."" 
Perhaps eliciting the greatest response within the industry is Duke's pledge 
to ""share the financial pain"" of California's troubled market with other 
market participants. 

Presently, Duke supplies about 5 percent of California's power needs, the 
majority of which is based on long-term contracts. This is a significant 
point because Duke has argued that its participation in the California market 
is not as entrenched in the volatile spot market, in contrast to many of the 
other power suppliers under FERC's investigation. The company also owns the 
Moss Landing plant, located south of San Jose, Calif., which it is upgrading 
with a $500 million investment. Duke has established that the plant should be 
able to provide approximately 30 percent of California's new generation in 
2002.  

While Duke downplays the role that California has played in its profits, the 
company's total wholesale profits soared 374 percent to $744 million for 
year-end 2000. For the year, Duke's California power plants generated 70 
percent more electricity than they did in 1999. In addition, in 2000 the 
plants provided 17 million megawatt hours of electricity to the state's power 
grid versus 9.5 million the previous year. 

Further, in January and February 2001, Duke charged more for power through 
""credit premiums,"" which were levied because of the risk of non-payment 
associated with California's financially struggling utilities. Duke claims 
that it is still owed about $100 million by the Department of Water 
Resources, California's power purchaser. 

Duke is not the only company forging settlement contracts with California. On 
May 2, Tulsa-based Williams Co. (also one of the top four companies 
reportedly owing the most to California) announced that it has agreed to pay 
$8 million to the California ISO to end FERC's investigation into whether the 
company's plants were kept offline to drive up prices. For several months, 
FERC has been investigating Williams regarding the company's alleged shutdown 
of two power generation units owned by AES, which reportedly allowed Williams 
to sell power from other units at higher prices. The stipulation and consent 
agreement reached between Williams and FERC identified no improprieties. In 
other words, Williams has made the payment but has admitted to no wrongdoing 
or price manipulation. A Williams spokesperson has said that the $8 million 
will be deducted from the $252 million that Williams is still owed for power 
sales to the California ISO and the California PX.  

Much like Duke, Williams has reported stellar profits over the last year. For 
year-end 2000, the company reported unaudited income from continuing 
operations of $873.2 million, or $1.95 per share on a diluted basis, versus 
$178 million, or 40 cents per share on a restated basis, for 1999. In 
addition, the company reported 1Q 2001 unaudited results that were more than 
double that of 1Q 2000-$378 million, or 78 cents per share, compared with a 
restated $139 million, or 31 cents per share.  

Moreover, the offers that Williams and Duke are forging with the state of 
California are probably only a small portion of what both companies have made 
from power sales to the state. However, one benefit of the deals is that they 
would keep the parties out of years of expensive litigation. Yet, at least as 
of this writing, Gov. Davis remains less than enthused about Duke's offer and 
has not eased off from his accusation that Duke (along with the other power 
generators) has ""bilked millions of dollars from California consumers."" In 
fact, although the governor has said that he is willing to continue 
negotiations with the various power generators, he has also vowed ""not to 
call off the dogs"" in the state and federal investigation of any price 
gouging. Toward that end, the state's lieutenant governor has initiated a 
class-action suit on behalf of California consumers against Duke and other 
power generators accused of price fixing. This legal claim follows similar 
suits initiated by the city of San Francisco and lawyers in San Diego. All of 
the suits basically claim the same thing, that Duke and four other power 
generators engaged in unlawful trading practices-such as shutting down 
plants-to drive up market prices in California.  

Duke, of course, maintains its innocence and says that the new lawsuit merely 
makes the same old claim that the company has repeatedly denied. 
Nevertheless, Duke has made a monetary offer to the state of California, 
which could be driven merely by the desire to avoid lengthy legal proceedings 
or by a concern that some wrongdoing on the company's part could eventually 
be determined. The stakes have also been raised with some California 
attorneys suggesting that any generators found to have engaged in price 
gouging should face civil and criminal penalties, which could include 
incarceration for any executive at the company who knowingly allowed the 
price manipulation to take place. Consequently, despite Duke's offer and any 
other proposals that subsequently come from power generators, it appears that 
litigation over the price gouging matter is unavoidable.

Following up on my voicemail, looks like Monday will now be the circulation

has a strike deadline of Tuesday.  Hopefully we will receive the final DASH 
today so that I can review the final and fax to Mark tonight or over the

Monday I will be in the SF office.  Assuming my flight is on time, I should 
arrive there around 9:30 a.m. Pacific time.  I will be available by pager

are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=

business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=

higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=

continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

I spoke with Colin Skellett (CEO of Wessex and AZX's vice chairman) and Keith 
Harris (Wessex's CFO) late this morning.  Here are some thoughts coming out 
of this conversation:

Wessex is launching the ""heads of terms"" (Britspeak for detailed bullet-point 
term sheet) with their lawyers, who have the Kelda announcements and 
experience on having done this in the electric industry in the UK.
Colin and Keith's view is that you will be extremely helpful in looking at 
how this works in practice and being sure the commercial overview points (not 
necessarily water industry points) are being addressed, from the perspective 
of both the service and the asset companies though obviously principally from 
the service company viewpoint.
The broad schedule is to meet with the lawyers Monday July 10 in London to go 
over the format, after you've had some time to acquaint yourself with what 
you need to understand about Wessex or the UK water industry.  (Keith is 
confirming that date with the lawyers but believes it will work.)
After that meeting, the term sheet will be refined on an iterative basis, 
probably going to full contract draft without numbers in, so that all issues 
are on the table in advance of the AZX board meeting, which is set for Monday 
Aug 7.  (Note that we will probably do the asset/service separation 
regardless of whether we decide to monetize the asset piece in some form.)

We've set up a conference call, subject to your schedule, for 10:30am Houston 
time tomorrow (Wednesday June 28) to go over this game plan.  From there, 
given the US holiday and other items, it's sounding like this will work well 
with the timetable you and I discussed yesterday.  In particular:

You could fly over to the UK Wednesday night July 5, arriving Thursday, and 
spend perhaps Thursday pm and all day Friday with Wessex personnel learning 
more about their business.  (They have a fairly standard tour of customer 
center, laboratories, and water and wastewater treatment plants that could be 
organized and I think would give you a good overview of their facilities.)
On Monday we could meet in London.
You could fly back to the US Tuesday the 11th, making your meeting on 
Wednesday the 12th as planned.
You would have ongoing involvement, perhaps involving a further trip to the 
UK, before the AZX board meeting in August, and thereafter. 

Unfortunately, that leaves you with a weekend in the UK.  You'd have to 
endure a tour of the Roman baths (very fascinating), a weekend in the 
Cotswolds (30 minutes from Bath and Bristol), or go to London early 
(theaters, shopping).  What we all do for Enron.  

Please let me know if 10:30 Wednesday works for a conference call so that I 
can let the folks there know.  The UK is 6 hours ahead of the US, so if we 
need to push back later we can still do so, though it's getting into their 
evening if we go much past noon our time.

Sorry for the long message--I'm in a meeting late afternoon today and may not 
be available if you call.","Colin Skellett Keith

419,"Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Ocean carbon storage: science shows promise, problems

Scientists from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory recently unveiled
new research results indicating that an advanced concept for ocean storage
may be the most cost-effective means to dispose of the carbon dioxide
emitted from power plants.

Carbon storage in the ocean is a controversial concept that has been around
for some time. However, it's increasingly looking like it may prove to be a
crucial option for carbon reduction over the coming decades.

""The idea is to put carbon in the ocean directly because it's going to wind
up there anyway,"" said Ken Caldeira, researcher at the Department of
Energy-funded Livermore Laboratory. ""The ocean can potentially store
centuries worth of fossil fuel emissions.""

More than 80% of the carbon naturally released or burned on the earth ends
up in the ocean. Encouraging the ocean to absorb even more carbon by
accelerating natural processes is tantalizing.

Absent a policy that supports emissions avoidance, capture and storage
options are the only currently known options to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions. Hence, the ocean's potential as a vast carbon sink could be an
important part of a future strategy to reduce atmospheric carbon
accumulation.

The question emerges, however: just because the ocean can play the role of
carbon sink, does this mean that it should be part of a reduction strategy?

""If you take the ocean option off the table, it's going to make ensuing
reductions that much more difficult to accomplish,"" said Robert Kane,
sequestration issue manager for the DOE. ""At this stage, all options should
be on the table."" Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

New gas storage complex in Arizona proposed
Three gas companies on Thursday proposed a 10 Bcf storage complex in Arizona
and an associated pipeline that would carry 800 MMcf/day between Las Vegas
and Southwestern Arizona. An open season for storage and transmission
capacity will run through Feb. 8, with service coming online in stages
between 2004 and 2008. The Desert Crossing Gas Storage and Transportation
System, expected to cost between $600 million and $700 million, will be a
joint project of Allegheny Energy Supply, Sempra Energy Resources and Salt
River Project, and will be the only north-south pipeline in the region. The
storage facility and 36-inch, 300-mile pipeline will ""serve the growing
needs of the southwestern United States for power and peak period gas
supplies,"" the companies said in a joint statement.

Baker Hughes-U.S. rig count down 27, Canada up 134
The number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the United States fell by 27
to 856 during the week ending Jan. 11, according to oil services firm Baker
Hughes. A year ago there were 1121. The number of rigs searching for oil
fell by two to 136, while the number of rigs searching for gas fell by 25 to
719. There was one miscellaneous rig, unchanged from last week.  The number
of rigs exploring for oil and gas in Canada was up 134 this week to 427
compared to 546 last year.

431,"CHOOSING A NEW  BATHING SUIT

Apparently a true e-mail a woman wrote to  her friend after shopping for
a bathing suit.

I have just been through the annual pilgrimage of torture and
humiliation known as buying a bathing suit.  When I  was a child in the
1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed
for a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not
so much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and
they did a good job.

Today's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a
figure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she
can either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral
suit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped
from Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill
department store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to
a designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.

What choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and
entered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first
thing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch
material.

The  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to
launch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that
if you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected
from shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a
swipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.

I fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder
strap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!
Eventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a
while to  find the other.

At last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is
that   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant
to wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.

I realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full
view assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it
only fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me
oozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a
lump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.

As I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the
pre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, ""Oh There you
are!"" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so
sure and asked what else she had to show me.

I tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of
masking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an
oversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of
leopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like
Tarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.

I tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in
mourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I
thought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.

Finally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style
bottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and
bulge  friendly, so I bought it.

When I got home, I read the  label which said ""Material may become

transparent in water."" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just
have to stay out of  the water!",Fantasia Jane,,the  maternity department Disney The  Lycra NASA

The following changes need to be made to the attached GTC for this product:

1.   Section 1:  Delete subsection (iv) and revise subsection (iii) to read 
as follows:

(iii) unless it has notified the other party in writing to the contrary, it 
is a domestic corporation (as such term is defined in Section 7701 of the 
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended);

2.   Section 2:  Before the paragraph beginning "" Each payment will be 
made..."", the following paragraph should be inserted:

All payments under this Transaction shall be made without any deduction or 
withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding 
is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any 
relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect.  If a party is so 
required to deduct or withhold, then that party (""X"") shall (a) promptly 
notify the other party (""Y"") of such requirement, (b) pay to the relevant 
authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including 
the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional 
amount paid by X or Y under this paragraph) promptly upon the earlier of 
determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving 
notice that such amount has been assessed against Y, (c) promptly forward to 
Y an official receipt (or a certified copy), or other documentation 
reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities, and 
(d) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment 
to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Transaction, such additional 
amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y 
(free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will 
equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or 
withholding been required.  However, X will not be required to pay any 
additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid 
but for (i) the failure or breach by Y of a representation or warranty set 
forth in Section 1 of these General Terms and Conditions or (ii) the failure 
of Y, upon reasonable demand by X, to provide any form, certificate or 
document that would allow X to make a payment to Y under this Transaction at 
a reduced rate of, or without any, withholding for or on account of any Tax.

3.   Section 9:  Add the following definition for Indemnifiable Tax:

""Indemnifiable Tax"" means any Tax other than a Tax that would not be imposed 
in respect of a payment under this Transaction but for a present or former 
connection between the jurisdiction of the government or taxation authority 
imposing such Tax and the recipient of such payment or a person related to 
such recipient (including, without limitation, a connection arising from such 
recipient or related person being or having been a citizen or resident of 
such jurisdiction, or being or having been organized, present or engaged in a 
trade or business in such jurisdiction, or having or having had a permanent 
establishment or fixed place of business in such jurisdiction, but excluding 
a connection arising solely from such recipient or related person having 
executed, delivered, performed its obligations or received a payment under, 
or enforced, this Transaction).

4.   Section 9:  Add the following definition for Tax:

""Tax"" means any present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment 
or fee of any nature (including interest, penalties and additions thereto) 
that is imposed by any government or other taxing authority in respect of any 
payment under this Transaction other than a stamp, registration, 
documentation or similar tax.

information.

As you are aware, I have been working with Vince's group on the Henwood model 
data.  The target was to have data on all India plants collected by Jan. 15th.

We all know that getting power out o Maharashtra holds the key to being able 
to solve the Dabhol challenge.  With all of your help, this model can become 
the tool that tells us exactly how that can be done, and at what prices.

We are a substantial part of the way there on data collection, and have got 
data of some 1500 plants across the country.  The spreadsheet for the same is 
attached.  This will help you answer any questions that come up in calls 
about the various plants.  Please note that we are located in the Western 
Region, or WR in the spreadsheet.  We will be further scrubbing the data and 
getting more recent and accurate information, especially on Maharashtra over 
the next 2-3 days.  

The Henwood team will be in India on Sunday, and will compare notes with the 
team here.  I am arranging for a presentation on the model and what it will 
do.  

Wade - It would be good if a broad section of the team attend, including 
Neil, yourself and Mohan.  I will talk to you about a convenient time for you 
in this regard.

Neil & Mohan - Over the next week (Monday and Tuesday) I will need some time 
from Vivek, Anshuman, Ravi, and a few others, to interact with the Henwood 
team.  I will be abliged if you can make that possible.

The first phase of model runs (which will be done by Jan. end) will just give 
us some more basic information, but I will need all of your inputs in order 
to ask the right questions.  The idea is that as we go along, this model will 
be used to answer all types of management questions concerning Dabhol, and 
power evacuation out of Maharashtra.

This will be critical for the team going forward.

Review of energy policies kicks off




Asahi Shimbun 

April 25, 2000 

A government advisory panel on Monday embarked on a
comprehensive review of energy-related policies. 

``We want to come up with feasible policies and at the
same time clearly present reasons for those policies,''
Yoichi Kaya, a professor emeritus at the University of
Tokyo, told a meeting of the Coordination Subcommittee
under the Advisory Committee for Energy, an advisory
panel to Minister of International Trade and Industry
Takashi Fukaya. Kaya chairs the subcommittee. 

The nuclear development policy, including the
government's goal for building new nuclear power plants,
is expected to be a focus of the discussions. 

A spate of nuclear accidents have made construction of
plants increasingly difficult, and the nation's power
suppliers have reduced the number of new nuclear power
plants expected to be in operation by fiscal 2010 from 20
to 13. 

The subcommittee, set up for the first time in about 10
years, is made up of about 30 members, and members of
anti-nuclear nongovernmental organizations have been
included for the first time. 

Some members told Monday's meeting that the
government must stop taking the nuclear development
policy for granted and seriously look into the possibility
of introducing renewable energy, such as wind and solar
power. 

Also on the agenda will be energy saving measures. 

Energy consumption in the residential and commercial
sector, made up of homes and offices, and in the
transportation sector, which includes cars and trucks, has
almost doubled over the past 25 years. 

At Monday's meeting, many members stressed the need
to change public consciousness toward the use of
energy. 

MITI plans to present studies on how life would be
affected by compulsory energy saving measures such as
automatically turning off air conditioners at certain
temperatures or vehicle engines when they are idle. ",Asahi Shimbun Yoichi Kaya Takashi Fukaya,,"the University of

learn.? I was wondering if you were aware of any openings at the  company

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.","Kristin Walsh Davis Bowen Tony  Strickland Lehman Davis

Enron's Skilling to Succeed Lay as Chief Executive Early Next Year

Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. named Jeffrey K. Skilling, its current president and 
chief operating officer, to succeed Kenneth L. Lay as chief executive officer 
of the energy giant. 
Mr. Skilling will retain his current posts as president and COO, while Mr. 
Lay will stay on chairman. The change will become effective Feb. 12.
Mr. Skilling, 47 years old, joined Enron (ENE) in 1990 after leading McKinsey 
& Co.'s energy and chemical consulting practices. He became president and COO 
in 1996 and has served on the company's board of directors since then. 
Mr. Skilling has been a major force behind Enron's move into the burgeoning 
commodities-trading business. Started as a traditional gas-pipeline company 
15 years ago, Enron has morphed into the largest trader of natural gas and 
electricity in North America, and a formidable manager of risk in markets for 
an array of products. It has in essence invented markets for trading for such 
nontraditional commodities as unused capacity in fiber-optic 
telecommunications lines and weather derivatives. 
Mr. Lay, 58, became Enron's chairman and CEO in 1986, following the creation 
of the company through the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. 
The change comes after Enron Vice Chairman Joseph W. Sutton announced his 
retirement in October to pursue other opportunities. Enron said at the time 
it had no plans to replace him.

Electric Gold Rush Is Zapping California

KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Houston Chronicle - Texas
Copyright (C) 2000 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM)

The crisis in California's power markets could mean a Christmas bonus for 
Houston energy companies selling power in the state. 
The cold weather that has hit Houston and the rest of the nation has put a 
serious strain on electricity supplies throughout the West Coast.
California electricity prices have soared this week after the state removed 
price caps on wholesale energy transactions to attract power into the market. 
Shares of companies with power plants that sell to the California wholesale 
market have risen in response. 
The lifting of the price caps means more power sales for four Houston 
companies that own about 25 percent of the unregulated power generated in 
California. These include Reliant Energy, Dynegy, El Paso Energy Corp. and 
Enron Corp. 
Reliant also owns power plants in Nevada that can sell power into the 
California market to capitalize on the higher prices now that the price cap 
has been lifted. 
Companies such as Reliant and Dynegy got into California buying plants that 
the state's large investor-owned utilities sold to comply with the law to 
deregulate the state's $23 billion electricity market. There have not been 
any power plants built in California in 10 years. 
The lack of additional generating capacity combined with growing demand is 
the most often cited culprit for California's power woes. Add to that are 
poorly written laws that opened the state to competition. 
The current cold snap has made a bad situation worse. 
A key source of backup power, water-generated hydropower from the Northwest, 
is not being sold in California because it is needed at home because of the 
cold weather. 
""We have been saying for months that new generation is needed in California,"" 
said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy, parent of HL&P. 
Reliant, through its unregulated operations, is the third-largest nonutility 
power generator in California. 
Making the situation even worse is a tightening supply of natural gas needed 
to burn in power plants and to heat homes. 
One of the biggest suppliers of natural gas to California is El Paso Energy 
Corp. Its pipeline to California is still operating at less than full 
capacity. The pipeline now moves about 920 million cubic feet of gas per day; 
its capacity is 1.1 billion cubic feet of gas per day. The company is still 
repairing its pipeline that ruptured in a fatal August explosion in New 
Mexico. 
The El Paso system was named before a Senate committee Tuesday as one of the 
main constraints on California's gas market by John Mazur, the acting 
administrator for the Energy Information Administration. 
Mel Scott, a spokesman for El Paso Energy, said the company has been unfairly 
singled out for criticism. He said the lines' customers have found other 
sources to make up for reduced flow of gas from the El Paso line. 
""We have been getting hammered over this, and we are just one of four major 
pipelines that serve California,"" Scott said. ""Our customers are taking 
everything we can deliver; they physically are taking all of the natural gas 
they can."" 
Other large pipelines into California are owned by Williams Cos., PG&E Corp. 
and Trans-Western. 
Whoever is to blame, the reality is that spot natural gas prices in 
California have in recent days risen to the unheard-of price of $40 per 
thousand cubic feet. 
While El Paso cannot take advantage of such prices on its pipeline gas -- 
which is sold under long-term contract -- its wholesale trading arm can 
profit from these prices, as can wholesale trading operations at other 
companies. 
Natural gas prices on the futures market, which have been hitting new records 
daily, dropped sharply on Tuesday on forecasts of milder weather next week. 
Natural gas for delivery in January to the Henry Hub closed at $8.14, down 
$1.26 per thousand cubic feet. 
The relatively small decline in futures prices will not spell any relief for 
California, which is using all of the natural gas it can get its hands on. 
California has been struggling to keep up with growing demand for power all 
year. In response to soaring prices when the weather was hot, the California 
Independent System Operator, which oversees operation of the state's power 
grid, began capping prices, first at around $750 per megawatt-hour, which was 
later decreased to $250. 
The cap was lifted earlier this week to try to lure power supplies from other 
states where generators can get a better price for their power. 
The result has been wholesale electricity prices setting daily records on the 
California Power Exchange, the state's main electricity market. The average 
price paid for electricity to be delivered Tuesday was $904 per 
megawatt-hour, up from $612 on Monday. 
Shares of all of the companies that have merchant power plants in California 
rose this week when the price caps were limited. 
The impact of the changing power market in California is much broader than 
just a quarterly increase or share price bump-up, said Bill Hyler, energy 
analyst with CIBC World Markets in New York. 
With the price caps lifted, and plans to shelve an even stricter $150 per 
megawatt-hour cap that was to be implemented in January, companies will have 
more incentive to get into the California market, Hyler said. 
""The ramifications of this go out for years,"" Hyler said. ""The consumer 
groups were looking for $100 price caps, and you can't make money with $8 to 
$10 gas with $100 price caps."" 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to weigh in this week on 
the decision to lift the price caps. Hyler said he expects they will support 
the move. 
Removing the price caps will give companies more incentive to consider 
building new California power plants, Hyler said. But it's not a quick fix. 
It takes about two or three years to get a new power plant sited, permitted, 
built and running. 
The long lead time for constructing new plants also means that the tight 
power supply situation in California cannot and will not be solved overnight, 
even when the weather moderates in the spring. 
This is the second time this year that the California markets have gone into 
a tailspin. 
In May, an unusual heat wave pushed temperatures in the San Francisco Bay 
area into triple digits, causing rolling blackouts. That helped power and 
natural gas companies post much improved second-quarter results. 
During the May heat wave, Dynegy's four California plants ran more than they 
did in all of May and June 1999. 
Such results from unregulated power sales continued into the third quarter. 
Reliant's wholesale energy business had third-quarter operating income of 
$319 million, up from $43 million in the same period last year. About $100 
million of that profit came from the California market, Wheatley said. 
Reliant and other power suppliers were able to provide enough power to get 
California through the hottest months of the year. So far, it has only taken 
about four days of severe winter weather to cause the crisis in California.

484,"Duque's Decision passed 3-2 (Duque, Neeper, Bilas - Lynch, Wood) - Both 
Neeper and Bilas said that they were only voting for this decision because of 
pressure. They both felt that last meeting's decision provided sufficient 
relief and provided for a investigation to address longer term problems.

Summary: 

The Decision institutes a rate stabilization for residential and commercial 
customers
 Residential: $68 through 1/1/01 and $75 through 12/31/01 for those who 
consume 500kW or less - market prices for the others residential 
 Commercial: $220 through 1/1/01 and $240 through 12/31/01 for those who 
consume 1500 kW or less - market place for other commercial

Other rate schedules: Subject to market prices

Implementation date: Retroactive to 6/1/00 - SDG&E will provide a credit for 
those customers that are eligible no latter than September 30th

The decision intends to allow for future adjustment of the kWh rate caps 
retroactive to June 1, 200 to ensure that customers in hotter inland regions 
have an appropriate level of usage cap and medium size commercial customers 
are provided relief.

The bill stabilization plan requires SDG&E to file comments, by September 30, 
addressing the implementation and transition of a Levelized Payment Plan 
(LPP) for all customers on an ""opt out"" basis. However, the procedure for the 
implementation of the LLP will allow customers to readily exercise choice, 
while those that do not exercise choice will default into the LPP.

The Commission will also further study the bill stabilization plan as to 
direct access customers. 

Revenue shortfalls are to be booked into the TCBA for future recovery of the 
net shortfall. 

Discussion: 
Senator Alpert, Assembly Women Davis, Mayor Golding , the former mayor, 
several members of the City and County of San Diego Board of Supervisors made 
a public appearance. All thanked the Commission for  having this special 
session. All supported the Wood decision. All stated that it did not  go far 
enough and insisted that all customers should be subject to the cap. Assembly 
Women Davis stated that she would be going back to the legislation  to pass 
the Davis/Alpert Bill establishing a cap for all customers. However, 
Asseblymember Wright, chairman of the Utilities and Commerce Committee, has 
been open and has shown opposition to the Alpert/Davis bill.

New Power Plant Planned
for New York City



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis



[News item from Energy Info Source] New York state's siting board approved =
Astoria Energy's plans to build a 1,000-megawatt power plant in New York Ci=
ty, clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January. Astoria=
 Energy hopes to have the natural-gas-fired, combined-cycle plant that will=
 be at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service=
 by 2004. The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepa=
ration before it can begin construction, and still must receive some local =
permits from New York City. Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC, a p=
rivately owned energy development company based in Concord, Mass.=20

Analysis: The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York =
City area should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply pro=
blems that have been identified within this region. Like California, New Yo=
rk also suffers from a supply / demand imbalance. However, even if or when =
power supply can be increased in New York, the core load center of New York=
 City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue t=
o take their own toll on the stability of the market. In other words, trans=
mission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the e=
xtent that power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported. The fact =
that Astoria Energy has received approval from New York state's siting boar=
d to proceed with this New York City-based plant is significant, but it sho=
uld not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from =
city government. This could be easier said than done, as other planned powe=
r plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the la=
st year by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who a=
rdently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new p=
lant construction.=20

The problems within the New York power market have been well documented. Th=
e state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant online since 199=
6, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost seven years s=
ince a 1,000-MW unit in Oswego, N.Y., marked the last plant to open upstate=
. Further, New York expects only a 3.5-percent increase in new capacity in =
the next three to four years. Consequently, concerns about the state's abil=
ity to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum. Pressure has =
been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for sitin=
g new plants in the state. However, at the same time, environmental and com=
munity groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby fo=
r limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power.=20

While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages, the problem app=
ears to be particularly acute in New York City. A November 2000 report issu=
ed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) entitled ""Investigati=
on of Bulk Power Markets, Northeast Region,"" highlighted specific capacity =
problems in the New York City/Long Island community of 11 million people. T=
hese areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most =
of the state's grid, the study said. Like Northern California, which suffer=
ed rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints, New York City and Lon=
g Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained transmi=
ssion lines. Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York, =
but cannot reach the city. Being both densely populated and heavily residen=
tial, it is difficult to site new power plants in the area. Consequently, 8=
0 percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the city. New=
 plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because New Yo=
rk City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times =
during the course of 2002. The projected shortfall is expected to increase =
by another 200 MW by summer 2002.=20

Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N=
ew York City and New York State. Demand in the state rose by 2,700 MW from =
1995 to 2000, or 2.5 times as fast as new generation capacity was added. De=
mand over the course of 2001 was expected to reach 31,100 MW, or about 3.7 =
percent above regulators' earlier forecasts.=20

It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will proceed with its =
plans for the new power plant in New York City. Astoria Energy is a private=
 company seeking to generate electric power with energy-efficient and envir=
onmentally sound technologies in the New York City area. The company is a s=
ubsidiary of SCS Energy, a privately owned energy development company forme=
d in 1998 for the purpose of developing and owning new electric generating =
facilities. Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds some additional =
light on the proposed plant. As noted, the 1,000-MW unit will be a natural =
gas-fired facility, which will obtain natural gas supplied from the ConEd/N=
ew York facility pipeline. The capital cost for the plant reportedly will b=
e $600 million. Commercial operation, pending the necessary approvals on th=
e local level, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2003. Astoria Energy =
is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant be=
cause it will be using a technology that is specifically geared toward the =
reduction of air emissions.=20

However, despite this optimism, the community opposition factor should not =
be discounted, and there are several examples that may foreshadow the oppos=
ition that Astoria Energy could face. Take Sithe Energies, for example, whi=
ch hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier=
 this year. Sithe Energies originally planned a 827-MW combined-cycle facil=
ity fueled by natural gas in Ramapo, N.Y. Chief among the concerns of local=
 residents is that the Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the t=
ime to meet demand, and as a result would use local water resources for coo=
ling purposes. Community resistance thus became an issue for the company, w=
hich altered its plans and began to consider a 510-MW peaking unit (also po=
wered by natural gas) that would only be operated in times of increased dem=
and.=20

As another example, environmental and community groups won a victory in cou=
rt just last week that essentially will block construction of small power p=
lants in the South Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island areas. Each is =
a 44-MW plant, though at some sites there are twin generators operating at =
less than 80 MW. A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of =
various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority, claimi=
ng (among other things) that the state had failed to perform adequate envir=
onmental-review studies. The groups claim that the state should test the pl=
ants for their output of fine particulate matter. A lower court had ruled i=
n favor of the state, but a judgment last week in the New York Court of App=
eals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups. The new =
ruling, which reportedly cannot be appealed further, says that the state mu=
st do unprecedented air tests at the 10 plants or shut them down by Jan. 31=
.=20

In a report issued earlier this year, New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (=
NYSEG), one of New York's seven utilities, said the state will not have eno=
ugh megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market unti=
l 2008. NYSEG, in a report issued late Wednesday, warned there are ""serious=
 problems with (New York's) generation supply and a lack of transmission an=
d pipeline infrastructure."" According to data included in a separate report=

Energy Trading, EnronOnline Help Enron Top 3rd Quarter Estimates
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/17/2000
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- After once again helping Enron Corp. (ENE) to top Wall 
Street's expectations, the importance of Enron's energy trading operations 
was further cemented in the third quarter. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings rose 31% to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, 
from $223 million, or 27 cents a share, before items, a year ago. 
Third-quarter revenue rose 154% to $30 billion from $11.84 billion.
In the year-ago period, Enron's net income was $290 million, or 35 cents a 
share, after a gain of $345 million, or 44 cents a share, on the sale of its 
stake in Enron Oil & Gas Co. (EOG), and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents 
a share, on its MTBE asset. 
According to First Call/Thomson Financial, analysts were expecting Enron to 
earn 32 cents a share in the latest third quarter. 
The key driver of the company's performance was its wholesale business, which 
includes EnronOnline and commodity sales, and which has transformed Enron 
from a gas pipeline company to the world's largest energy trader. 
In the third quarter, the wholesale business just had ""a stunning quarter,"" 
said Enron President Jeff Skilling. 
Revenue from Enron's wholesale energy operations and services unit, which 
includes EnronOnline and commodity sales, more than doubled to $28.15 billion 
from $11.06 billion. 
Income before interest, minority interest and taxes, or IBIT, in the third 
quarter rose 66% to $627 million from $378 million a year ago. 
During the latest period, physical deliveries of energy commodities grew 64% 
to 53.5 trillion British thermal units, Enron said. 
EnronOnline, the company's Internet-based transaction system, is driving the 
growth of the wholesale segment, said Raymond Niles, an analyst at Salomon 
Smith Barney. 
Currently, more than 60% of the Enron's wholesale business occurs through 
EnronOnline. As of Oct. 11, EnronOnline had executed more than 350,000 
transactions online, totaling $183 billion of gross value since its inception 
in late 1999. 
EnronOnline, which initially bought and sold natural gas, electricity, 
petrochemicals, and bandwidth, has expanded to other commodity areas such as 
metals and pulp and paper. 
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin supports Enron's decision to expand to 
other commodities. ""The only limit (to expanding to other commodities) is 
intellectual capital,"" Feygin said. 
He estimates that the North American steel business is a $35 billion 
business, while pulp and paper is about $150 billion. 

At least part of the success that Enron had during the third quarter was the 
result of price volatility in California's deregulated energy market. 
However, the company wouldn't specify what it earned in the state. 
During the third quarter, utilities in the Golden State paid near-record 
rates for electricity as higher demand pushed the power grid to the brink. 
""The uncertainty and the volatility that we have been seeing in the 
electricity and the gas market has been beneficial to Enron,"" said Enron's 
Skilling. 
California's situation is rather unique, he said. Skilling expects 
Californian electricity markets will improve as supply and demand fall into 
balance and other technical market questions are resolved. 
Although Enron posted strong earnings across the board, it is getting clearer 
that the company will look to divest itself of some of its international 
assets. 
According to a source familiar with the company, Enron recently completed an 
analysis of its assets with the intent of identifying underperforming assets 
and improving capital efficiency. As a result of the analysis, some assets 
were marked for sale. 
Skilling admitted the company would like to monetize some of its 
international assets, but he wouldn't say which assets are on the auction 
block. 
However, it is unlikely Enron will sell its international gas pipelines 
because the assets receive a solid rate of return, Skilling said. 
One asset that could be divested is Enron's Dabhol Power Project in 
Maharashtra, India, said analysts. Other power plants in Italy and Turkey 
also seem like logical candidates for sale. 
""I think it makes a lot of sense for Enron,"" said Salomon's Niles. ""Enron is 
moving into markets where they are relying on intellectual capital rather 
than physical capital,"" he said. Following this logic, assets such as the 
India power plant don't make as much sense as they once did. 
In some cases, the international assets are in countries that didn't open to 
competition as expected, explained Zach Wagner, an analyst at Edward Jones. 
Since deregulation has been fueling Enron's growth, it only makes sense that 
the company concentrate on open markets. 
Furthermore, Wagner believes the money Enron will raise in the asset sales 
could be re-deployed to fund projects such as the company's venture with 
Blockbuster Inc. (BBI) to provide movies on demand via high-speed telephone 
lines.

 February 23, 2000




MEMORANDUM

TO: Interested Clients

FROM:  John & Hengerer

RE: Commission Meeting -- February 23, 2000

At today's meeting, the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and 
discussed the following items.  

HYDRO AGENDA
Public Utility District No. 1 of Okanogan County, Washington, Docket No. 
P-10536
This draft order rescinded the hydro license issued to Public Utility 
District No. 1 of Okanogan County, Washington (Utility District) after the 
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) conditioned the license on 
construction of a fish ladder that would have rendered the proposed project 
uneconomic.  Commissioner Hebert moved the item to the discussion agenda to 
highlight the difficulties incurred in hydro licensing proceedings due to the 
conditioning authority granted to certain federal agencies, such as NMFS.  
Because such agencies possess the authority to impose costly environmental 
conditions, Commission Hebert stated, they essentially hold veto power over 
project applications.  Commissioner Hebert urged federal agencies to weigh 
potential public benefits before imposing costly environmental conditions 
that doom proposed projects.  

Avista Corporation, Docket No. P-2058
In this draft order, the Commission granted a hydro license to Avista 
Corporation.  Chairman Hoecker moved the item to the discussion agenda to 
champion the use of alternate licensing procedures and applaud the parties 
for negotiating the settlement approved by the draft order.  Avista began 
negotiating for the license in 1996 and eventually reached a settlement with 
26 stakeholders.  According to Chairman Hebert, such negotiations maximize 
benefits, reduce application costs, and set a positive example for other 
parties to follow.  Although the other Commissioners generally echoed 
Chairman Hoecker's praise, Commissioner Hebert criticized the draft order for 
not quantifying the environmental benefits of Avista's proposed project.  

 ELECTRIC MATTERS
New England Power Pool, ISO New England, Docket Nos. ER00-984, et al.
Price caps on the ISO's Operating Reserve and Operable Capability markets 
were extended by the Commission in this draft order, Commissioner Hebert 
dissenting.  Both caps expired on December 31, 1999.  The cap on the 
Operating Reserve Market was extended until June 30, 2000, or until the ISO 
submits a market redesign plan to correct market flaws.  The cap on the 
Operable Capability Market was extended until February 29, 2000, after which 
the market will be terminated.  According to the ISO's filing, which was 
approved in this draft order, the Operable Capability Market duplicates other 
ISO markets and is no longer needed.

Commissioner Hebert dissented and moved the item to the discussion agenda to 
express his disapproval of price caps, both in general and in this particular 
proceeding.  In general, Commissioner Hebert believes that price caps remove 
the natural incentives created by a competitive market.  In this particular 
proceeding, Commission Hebert argues that supposedly temporary price caps

I mentioned that my brother, an attorney in New York, is active in state 
politics and might be a useful contact in the state. I'm following up with 
this note to let you know a bit more about him. 

Larry Mandelker is a partner with Kantor, Davidoff Wolfe Mandelker & Kass in 
New York City. He is outside counsel to the Republican State Committee and 
represented Bill Powers when he recently joined the Crane Group in Albany. 
Larry works closely with the Crane Group's legal operation, Crane Green & 
Parente, in many state matters.

There's another reason why I thought to mention Larry. He currently 
represents Sunset Energy Fleet, a company managed by Jerry Montrose, which is 
negotiating to win state permits for barge-mounted generation off of Brooklyn 
as well as gas supply contracts. He knows exactly what the power industry 
faces in New York.

If anyone would like to contact him, I'll forward that person's name to him. 
I'll give you his telephone number, too --
212-682-8383 x 30 -- if you'd like to file it away.

Please let me know if there's any additional information you'd like to see.

eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

?=09Campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the Corporate Capital Tax=

Energy Agenda

According to sources, under the Liberal party's rule, significant changes i=
n the BC government's energy policy could include a move toward the privati=
zation of some BC Hydro assets, perhaps including its transmission assets, =
as well as increased government support for independent power producers and=
 coal-fired production.  At the same time, a rate review and attempts to es=
tablish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack =
of clarity about the province's overall energy strategy over the next few y=
ears.  Campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding =
coal-fired production.  Campbell calls thermal coal, ""an asset that we want=
 to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in BC.""  A hig=
h-ranking NDP source believes that Campbell will take the province back alo=
ng the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new techn=
ology.  The source expects this to lead to strong protests from environment=
alists.  ""These are confrontational moves, and people will be on the street=
s.""=20

Campbell's most likely choice for energy minister is Richard Neufeldt, thou=
gh we caution that this decision depends on the make-up of the legislature =
after the election.  Neufeldt is responsible for the Liberal Party's energy=
, mining and northern development portfolio.  Sources speculate that if rig=
ht-wing Liberals are dissatisfied with the party's performance after the Ma=
y election, Neufeldt could again defect to the Opposition.  However, this g=
ives Campbell even greater incentive to name Neufeldt energy minister, a hi=
gh-profile position.

Should the Liberals win the election, Gordon Campbell has indicated that he=
 would return BC Hydro to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission.  The B=
C government has derived $5.5 billion in revenue from BC Hydro since 1991 (=
roughly 85 percent of its profit).  Critics say this has undermined the uti=
lity's ability to pay down approximately $7.5 billion in debt and invest in=
 the future. This also has left Hydro without a rate stabilization fund, so=
mething that sources feel may be needed this year.  Campbell reportedly int=
ends to address these issues, and one can expect this to lead to calls for =
change.
=20
Electricity Export Policy

Currently the BC Utilities Commission is demanding more information about B=
C Hydro's out-of-province sales.  The Commission has warned that, given the=
 low snow pack, the utility could be a net importer of power this year. Sup=
porting this view, the Northwest Power Planning Council, representing BC Hy=
dro's key trading partners in the US, has said that it would not be able to=
 rely upon British Columbia or Alberta during peak consumption periods over=
 the next few years, and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not=
 making it through the winter without power losses.  The combination of a l=
ow snow pack, a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and pub=
lic concern about outstanding debts owed to BC Hydro by US consumers may fo=
rce BC Hydro to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts ex=
pire.

BC Hydro Privatization

A key campaign energy issue for the Liberal party is the privatization of B=
C Hydro.  Campbell has urged greater electricity competition, saying, ""We n=
eed to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all, producer=
s and consumers, on an equal and non-discriminatory basis."" He stated that =
independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn. ""I want to=
 change that big time,"" he told the Canadian Institute of Energy.  Campbell=
 also urged more natural gas development, including pipelines and co-genera=
tion plants.

Campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by NDP=
 leader Ujjal Dosanjh.  Campbell stated on 25 April, ""We have no intention =
of selling BC Hydro; we have no intentions of selling their transmission li=
nes, no intention of selling their dams, we have no intention of selling th=
eir reservoirs.""  Liberal Party spokesman Mike Morton also reiterated on 29=
 April that BC Hydro would not be for sale.  A high-level NDP source commen=
ted that Campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regardi=
ng BC Hydro, essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams, trans=
mission lines or generating stations, but that he is in favor of opening th=
e sector up to competition.

However, local sources believe that some parts of BC Hydro might be sold as=
 part of an overall review of BC Crown Corporations to enhance efficiency. =
 Likely sale prospects include BC Hydro's distribution channels and its ene=
rgy trading subsidiary, Powerex.  In addition, Gary Farrell-Collins, the Li=
beral finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister (=
after Neufeldt), has stated that public ownership of BC Hydro's non-core bu=
sinesses, such as Westech, its systems division, and customer billing, coul=
d come under review.

BC Hydro Williston Generation

Current reservoirs levels at BC Hydro's Williston hydro-generation facility=
 are at 2,150ft, which allows BC Hydro to drop levels another 35 ft (170 Gw=
hs/ft) under their current permit.  The one drawback to this plan's additio=
nal generation involves the Mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease op=
eration if water levels were to fall below 2,140ft.  Sources close to the M=
inister of Mines & Energy - elect, Richard Neufeldt, indicate that levels a=

532,"Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.
The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.

The Legislature's options: 
1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.
2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a ""waiver,"" which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.
3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.

In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.

Where to from here?
Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.
Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that ""...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'"" and ""...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end.""  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  
Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.
With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.
Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said:
Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without ""adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses.""
He doesn't know why ""the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session.""
With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.

If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.

We'll report back with additional information as we get it.

Best,

537,"We  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on Sunday night.  The main points are:  

     1. Rationing losses:   Defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from June 01 until the end of rationing in 02. Recovery includes financial compensation. Immediate funding of 80% through BNDES, with Brazilian government funds. Loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  Funding scheduled by December 15th.  Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R$191million or US$ 73 million.

       2.  April/May MAE settlement :   Market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on Elektro's books.  Impact of approximately R$ 18 million or US$ 7 million. 

       3.  Parcel  ""A"" for the future:  All non-controlable costs to which LDC's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the LDC tariff revision date.  Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. Elektro Ebitda impact  2002 forward of R$ 60 million or US$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.

        4. Parcel A from the past:   Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney General's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    Elektro impact  is R$145 million or US$ 55 million in 2001. The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.  

We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.

Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  These  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool.  

Total amounts for the sector represent about R$ 10 billion or US$3.8 billion at the current rates.  Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.

highlights that you might find interesting:

Stock Options:

The amount of the stock option benefit reported as income is reduced from 3/4 
to 2/3 on options exercised after February 27, 2000.  In other words, 33% is 
not taxable (was 25%).

Tax Rates:

Basic personal exemption will increase to $7,231 (currently $7,131)
this change will be effective on the July 1-15 pay and will be doubled for 
the remainder of 2000

Spousal amount is increasing to $6,140 (currently $6,055)

The new tax rate structure for 2000:

17% of taxable income up to $30,004 (was $29,590)
25% of taxable income between $30,004 and $60,009 (was $29,590 to $59,180)
29% of taxable income in excess of $60,009 (was $59,180)

Limits to Foreign Content Increased:

Despite a ""hot tip"" that RRSP contribution limits would be raised in this 
year's budget, it did not happen.  However, the foreign content limit for 
RPPs and RRSPs is increased from 20% to 25% for 2000 and to 30% for 2001.

Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to

*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $1.05/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity ""NewAlb"" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

q:
BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband

million
reported in the first quarter of 2000 and a decrease of 9% from the $340.2
million reported in the fourth quarter of 2000. Net revenue includes the
non-cash revenue deduction of the fair value of assumed performance-based
warrants earned by certain customers.

Pro forma net income was $24.2 million, or $.09 per share (diluted). This
compares with pro forma net income of $44.9 million, or $.18 per share
(diluted), for the same quarter in 2000, and pro forma net income of $88.8
million, or $.32 per share (diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2000. Dilute=

earnings per share for the quarter were based on 281.0 million weighted=20

shares outstanding, compared to 252.6 million weighted average shares
outstanding in the first quarter of 2000 and to 274.1 million weighted aver=
age
shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Broadcom reports net income and diluted earnings per share on a pro forma=
=20
basis,
which excludes the effects of the non-cash revenue deduction related to
performance-based warrants, acquisition-related expenses, certain=20
non-recurring
settlement charges, and payroll taxes on certain stock option exercises.
Including these charges, substantially all of which were non-cash, net loss=

for
the first quarter was $356.9 million, or $1.43 per share, compared with net
income of $38.6 million, or $.15 per share (diluted), in the same quarter o=
f
2000, and with a net loss of $768.3 million, or $3.28 per share, in the fou=

quarter of 2000.

During the quarter, Broadcom announced and closed its acquisition of=20

Corporation, a leading supplier of high performance SystemI/O(TM) solutions=

=20
also
completed the acquisition of Visiontech Ltd., a leading supplier of digital
video/audio MPEG-2 compression and decompression chips enabling Personal Vi=

These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounti=

""Our first quarter results met the revised expectations that we communicate=

March 6th. Looking ahead, as a result of the continued weakness in the
communications sector, we have not yet seen improvement in order visibility=

customers,"" said Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III, Broadcom's President and CEO.
""Despite the current weakness that exists in the business, we continue to b=
e
confident that our product roadmaps in both the core and emerging markets w=

position us well as the economy recovers.""

During the first quarter, Broadcom introduced several significant new=20
products.
The company announced the world's first 0.13 micron CMOS Gigabit Copper
Transceiver, a four channel device on a single monolithic chip. This produc=
t
enables cost-effective, high port count Gigabit Ethernet switches and route=
rs=20
by
doubling port density and reducing size and power requirements by 50%. This
industry leading product marks the fourth generation of Gigabit transceiver
products from Broadcom.

Broadcom's new products for optical communications applications included th=
e
world's first system-on-a-chip OC-48 line card, the world's first single-ch=
ip
OC-192 CMOS transceiver, a low power and low cost OC-192 framer and the=20
world's
lowest power 10-Gigabit CMOS limiting amplifier. These product introduction=
s
position Broadcom very well in the market for broadband optical=20
communications.

Broadcom's newly acquired ServerWorks business made two noteworthy=20
announcements
during the first quarter. First, ServerWorks unveiled its new Grand=20
Champion(TM)
architecture for future Intel(R) Xeon(TM) based servers. This product is th=
e
first to support PCI-X, the new high performance input/output standard for
server and workstation platforms and the first to deliver memory bandwidth =
of
6.4 Gbytes/second or four times the company's previous solutions. In additi=
on,
ServerWorks announced new SystemI/O logic that is optimized for dense Inter=
net
network servers produced by OEM customers such as Compaq, Dell, IBM, NEC an=
d
Siemens.

During the quarter, the Home Networking Business Unit extended its industry
leading position by surpassing the two million unit milestone for total num=
ber
of units shipped. HomePNA(TM), which utilizes the phone lines already in a=
=20
home,
continues to be the most widely produced home networking technology.

Broadcom also announced, sampled, gained design wins and has begun shipping=
=20
the
world's first single-chip IP phone solution incorporating Ethernet switch
technology, dual Ethernet transceivers, DSP and RISC processor cores and=20
analog
CODECs for handset and speakerphone support. This highly integrated Etherne=
t=20
IP
phone chip enables toll-quality IP phones with the lowest power consumption=

Broadcom also introduced the first all-CMOS Bluetooth(TM) radio to achieve
Bluetooth qualification. This radio is designed specifically for use in mob=
ile
phone handsets and further extends Broadcom's Blutonium(TM) line of Bluetoo=
th
solutions.

Broadcom's tuner chip was the first to receive CableLabs(TM) certification =
and
EuroDOCSIS certification. This will continue to allow manufacturers to=20

Pro Forma Only

The above pro forma statements are based upon our unaudited
consolidated statements of operations for the periods shown, with
certain adjustments. The pro forma statement for the three months
ended March 31, 2001 has been adjusted to eliminate a non-cash revenue
deduction of $7.6 million constituting the fair value of
performance-based warrants earned by certain customers; $109.7 million
of in-process research and development expense; $1.5 million of
payroll tax expense on certain stock option exercises; $119.7 million
of stock-based compensation expense related to mergers and
acquisitions (""M&A""); $218.3 million of amortization of goodwill and
purchased intangible assets related to M&A; and $3.0 million of
litigation settlement costs; and reflects a pro forma effective tax
rate of approximately 20%.
The pro forma statement for the three months ended March 31, 2000
has been adjusted to eliminate $3.7 million of payroll tax expense on
certain stock option exercises; $1.3 million of stock-based
compensation expense related to M&A; and $2.9 million of
merger-related costs; and reflects a pro forma effective tax rate of
approximately 20%.

All historical financial information has been restated to give

 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K SEC M&A BROADCOM CORPORATION Company Broadcom Corp. 949/585"
575,"Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
""The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market,"" FERC said in its draft order. ""Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate."" 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, ""given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California."" 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was ""extremely successful,"" adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
""The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States,"" said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
""We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region,"" said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
""Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent,"" said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. ""We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.'' 
Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at (270) 688-6968, Mark Elliott at (270) 688-6637 or Dale Sanders at (270) 688-6944. More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at <http://westernfrontier.williams.com> .

Tulsa-based Williams on Monday launched uE, a cross-commodity price index for both spot and future energy prices, as a companion to its web-based EnergyNewsLive.com. Similar to the Dow Jones for equity markets, the Williams uE will offer an equivalent benchmark for the overall price of energy, measuring the price average of eight individual commodities: electricity, natural gas, unleaded gasoline, heating oil, ethane, propane, residual fuel and jet fuel. 
The site includes information on pricing trends including a national spot uE, forward uE, regional uE, commodity quotes, as well as daily, weekly and monthly commentary. Included on the site is EnergyPulse, which will feature Dr. Dennis O'Brien, director of energy and policy at the University of Oklahoma. EnergyPulse now airs every Friday on Williams' EnergyNewsLive site, and offers an analysis of trends in energy pricing and the impact the economy has on energy. 
Williams uE was introduced a year ago when EnergyNewsLive debuted, and Williams said it has tested and refined the site for the company's own market activity.

ok we are all set up.  We are going to do a snow shoe trip on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. for 2 hours.  Supposedly easy trail, just enough to work up a sweat.  Then we are going to drive (45 minute scenic drive) to Hot Springs, Co.  Probably have time for a lunch.  Our messages are set up for 3:00 p.m. and we get to soak in any one of 21 sulphur pools at our leisure.  Sounds divine doesn't it?

Since they have to put salt on the pavement the guy suggested that we bring our own flip flops.  He says we can rent towels and robes but if I remember I'll bring them for us as backups if they don't have any available.

So looks like you just need warm clothing and flip flops.  Oh yeah, do you have a warm pair of boots.  We can rent the snowshoing equipment but we have to have a good pair of warm boots.  If you don't think you have a pair let me know and I can bring an extra pair along.  Hopefully they won't be too big for your tiny feet.  But boots are usually big anyway just wear lots of socks!

Attached is the ComEd Letter of Intent to interconnect at the Plano TSS.  In 
addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant 
level of uncertainty regarding a '01 interconnect at Plano.  Under the 
guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd's Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are 
required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) 
in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.  If 
we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes 
the date of execution of the LOI.

Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron 
with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days 
(ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD 
will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an 
estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and 
PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie 
ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study 
currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the 
next 2-3 weeks).  

ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current 
interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a 
proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed 
projects' queue position relative to competing projects provided that all 
interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain 
current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project 
with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the 
necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line 
prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that 
this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This 
interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site 
relative to the Wizvest planned '01 interconnect).

I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe 
that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the 
interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment 
responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed 
interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this 
week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior 
to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have 
recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am 
simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in 
a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  
From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd's boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we 
executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines 
Green Land Development, L.L.C.

One more thing I want to mention.  As you know, Enron has a confidentiality 
agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).  The 
agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company 
from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we 
are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the 
exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?  

FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on 
Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the 
general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.  
I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.

643,"Kay, 
One of the first things we do after we execute an option agreement is to get into the interconnect queue.  To do so, we must enter into an interconnect study agreement and in the past we have entered into these agreements using the same project agreement that has the option agreement.  Are you saying that we need two project companies for each project: one for the option agreement and one for the interconnect study agreement?  As you may know, it has taken 11 months to get to the point in the Midway project from the time we executed an interconnect study agreement with FPL to today when we are ready to begin negotiating a construction and connection agreement.  Would you please clarify the issue for me?

Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction
Process With FERC

FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative 
regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity
auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process.

In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for 
selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. 
The filing
was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is 
consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which
encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' 
to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637,
Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance 
filing made June 15.

``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party 
that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of
Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we 
conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often
wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current 
process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the 
auction is
closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''

According to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving 
to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into
consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in 
capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term
contracts.

Under Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via 
its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm 
capacity.
Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the 
quantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted
capacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if 
Columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with 
a
different term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a 
present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time 
before a
binding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.

Columbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles 
outlined in FERC's Order 637. 

    *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will
          begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be
          posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST).
    *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-
          discriminatory basis.
    *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing
          EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be
          made available on the Internet.
    *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since
          bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to
          each capacity package made available.
    *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's
          identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection
          criteria were applied.
    *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all
          bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to
          all bidders through an Internet-based system.


``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity 
auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all 
parties
as well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.

Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is 
based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for
transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to 
withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.

Columbia Gas Transmission, with offices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax, 
Va., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to
markets along a 12,550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10 
Midwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The company operates one
of the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240 
billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working capacity.

Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading 
energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its
operating companies engage in nearly all phases of the natural gas business, 
including exploration and production, transmission, storage and distribution,

There would be more interest in Eagan as opposed to Moss Bluff.  Moss Bluff 
is connected to the A/s line but the interconnect is controlled by Channel or 
TPC and generally is not a reliable Firm Service point..  We have looked into 
building our own interconnect in the past with a cost of around $2 million if 
my memory serves me right.  At that price I would much rather have Centana 
Stg Vs Moss Bluff.

I talked to Scott Neal about Eagan and he asked to be included in any 
discussions.

As far as the value of the capacity that will depend on the injection rate, 
storage capacity and withdrawal rate as well as what pipelines are involved.  
As a general idea I would say Moss Bluff is worth between $.84 - $1.44 and 
Eagan $1.20 - $2.00.  This can be further defined when Paul stops by.

The value of the information issue should be addressed to Scott Neal and Tom 
Martin.

Enron is no longer interested in these season tickets and is working to secure the best economic result for the estate.  This may involve stopping any further payments, however if there is significant interest among employees in buying the season tickets from Enron, the company may pursue a resale arrangement as one means of recovering the investment it has already made.

If you're interested in purchasing any of Enron's PSLs and season tickets for the Texans, please respond by 4PM, Central Time on Wednesday, June 12 via e-mail to Elizabeth Linnell.  In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you would be interested in purchasing and the price category.  Once the number of interested potential buyers is determined from the employee group, Enron will determine how to proceed in order to benefit the estate.   As listed below, the face value of the PSLs range from $1,900 to $3,900 each, and the face value of the season tickets range from $645 to $2575 each.   It is currently envisioned that if any sale of the interests by Enron does occur, it would be open to the public as well as employees.

Please note that your response will not obligate either you or Enron in any way.  Responses will be considered an expression of interest only, and do not guarantee if, when, or at what price respondents may be able to purchase these assets.

747,"After talking further with MISO folks about the new attachment M, it appears that the MISO will _effectively_ be requiring physical losses, although they don't come out and say that. Financial losses are essentially at the option of the TO, so we ""may"" be able to do Financial losses if the TOs want to offer the service.

In more detail, this is how the process will work:

TCs will use the MISO's loss calculator to identify impacted TOs
If ALL TOs have provided financial loss pricing information, then it will be possible to buy losses
If not, the TC will be required to self supply

TOs can change their loss pricing (or desire to offer financial losses) every 12 hours.  Effectively, this means it will be difficult at best to manage risk associated with having the FIN rug pulled out from under us at scheduling time.  I will continue to work on this issue with Mike  and push for a financial solution that provides for our needs.

Just a couple of notes.

B 1 (b):  I think the master gas contract form includes Affiliates on 
non-defaulting party side--see end of Article 4.

If a Triggering Event occurs, the Notifying Party may (at its election) set 
off any or all amounts which the Affected Party owes to the Notifying Party 
or its Affiliates (under this Agreement or otherwise) against any or all 
amounts which the Notifying Party owes to the Affected Party (either under 
this Agreement or otherwise).

B 2 (f):  The analysis is based upon Enron default.  If counterparty default 
analysis is used, Enron benefits; and don't all contracts at least have all 
transactions terminating if bankruptcy is the triggering event?

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Weather Risk Management
The Weather Desk is please to announce the completion of a large transactio=
n in Europe designed to protect construction workers from lost wages on day=
s when construction is halted due to adverse weather conditions.  Enron com=
pleted this deal with a European bank that in turn is selling this protecti=
on to a fund manager for construction workers. Under the terms of this tran=
saction, Enron will pay the bank when the number of ""frost days"" reaches a =
predetermined amount outlined in the contract. Frost days are calculated wh=
en the hourly temperature falls below the strike temperature. This innovati=
ve transaction is the first of its kind and presents many possibilities for=
 future contracts with companies whose earnings are dependent on the weathe=
r.

This transaction originated in the London office and was structured in the =
Houston office. Please call Sandeep Ramachandran at (713) 853-0964, Paul Mu=
rray at +44 (207) 783-4769 or Sanjeev Khanna at (713) 853-3849 for further =

807,"With respect to Rob Hemstock's email of August 31st, and Richard Sanders and 
Glenn Leslie's comments of this morning, it would appear that the coalition 
being discussed could have a major benefit to Enron and in the normal course 
of events would be something that Enron would participate in.

Having said this, Rob Hemstock's comment that the safest course of action is 
not to participate is accurate.

In the event that Enron determines to proceed with the coalition, 
notwithstanding Project Stanley, it is my view that a low key role with the 
right to withdraw from the coalition at any time may be the appropriate way 
to go given that as Project Stanley proceeds, we are going to have to work 
hand in hand with Powerex from time to time.

In my view this is something that we should consider further in the next few 
days

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

It has come to our attention that a group of employees missed their January 15th 401-K deduction.  This was due to an incorrect employment status being fed by ENRON's SAP system to our 401-K vendor which resulted in your contribution amounts being defaulted to zero.

Your 401-K contribution amounts were restored for the January 31, 2002 payroll.  If you would like to have your contribution for the January 15, 2002 pay date taken on the February 28, 2002 pay date please respond by February 14, 2002.   If we do not receive a response by February 14, 2002 we will assume that you have decided not to have a make up 401-K contribution for the one missed on January 15, 2002.  We are trying to be sensitive to the possible hardship a double deduction could have on your personal financial situation.   If you are not contributing the maximum percentage you could make an adjustment to your contribution percentage going forward to accomodate the missed January 15, 2002 contribution.

As always we encourage all employees to review your investment elections to ensure they are consistent with your investment goals.

876,"Another big victory for Enron in New York! In an Order issued by the NYPSC on 
March 29, the NYPSC has approved a proposal to modify the existing fixed 
backout credit of 2.8 cents per kwh for energy and capacity and replace it 
with a market-based backout credit. The additional retail adder of 0.4 cents 
per kwh would remain.  Load-serving entities (LSEs) will have the option of 
continuing to buy their energy and capacity from RG&E at the market based 
backout credit which will be determined 15 days prior to the beginning of 
each of the two six-month capability periods, and will be based on ""a 
forecast of energy prices derived from Enron Corporation's (Enron) 
EnronOnline trading platform.""  To my knowledge, this is the first occasion 
that a regulatory body has agreed to use Enron Online as an index!  LSEs can 
elect instead to procure their own commodity and get a market-based backout 
credit (MBBC). Under this option, the LSEs will get a market based backout 
credit. However, the Enron online prices for the six months determined as 
above will be reconciled on a lag basis against actual market prices.  The 
PSC has capped the amount of the reconciliation for any LSE to the product of 
the LSE's total load for the calendar year and $0.065 per kwh (PSC staff's 
estimate of RG&E's embedded power supply cost).  (The PSC Order actually says 
$0.015 but this appears to be a mistake since the attached settlement states 
$0.065.) A copy of the PSC's Order is available on its website:

877,"Here is a copy of the economists letter the Independent Institute released on 
health care.  It is about 330 words long.
  
http://independent.org/tii/news/OpenLetterHealthCare0002.html
 

Here is my first draft of a letter to economists for power price caps.  It is 
275 words long, so we have some room.



The tricky thing here is the interplay between retail and wholesale price 
regulation that is not present in other price control situations.  In other 
words, the public utility nature of retail prices complicates things a bit, 
so our letter will have to be careful about not losing support from 
economists who wonder if this is really about a natural monopoly 
situation--at retail at least.

Maybe instead of price decontrol at retail we can just call for a move toward 
real-time pricing.

Comments appreciated.

887,"Scott & Walt:

A couple of things...I talked to Theresa today and the OBA Spreadsheet (or actually,  Enron's imbalance sheet) needs to be changed for both October and November as follows:

October:

ENA purchased 300 mmbtu/d from Westport  at the Bear Paw point beginning October 9.  We need to add a column on the ENA sheet (i.e. similar to Phillips) showing that 300 mmbtu.
Quantum - ENA did not purchase any gas from Quantum for October.  We had some measurement of gas from Quantum throughout the month.  This needs to go to imbalance between Quantum and Crestone.

November:

ENA is purchasing 1,000 mmbtu/d from Quantum.  If Quantum produces more than 1,000 mmbtu/d that extra goes to imbalance between Quantum and Crestone.
ENA is not purchasing Westport's gas at this time.

I would be happy to make these changes, but I am unsure as to how this file affects your Meter Allocation report and I don't want to mess that one up!!!  

I'm copying Theresa on this memo....please feel free to add to it if I missed something.

905,"Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes 
the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that 
you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping 
bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, 
but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well 
here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of 
people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you 
left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, 
some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of 
this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status 
of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the 
computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner 
that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, ""What does 
it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a 
disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?"" 
They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most 
things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of 
authority, as in, ""No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly 
be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market 
right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at 
a time like this?"" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is 
why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the 
great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office 
will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to 
coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through 
the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, 
and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to 
say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an 
amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I 
believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and 
constantly refer to you as ""my good friend Winston who's skiing across the 
state of Wyoming, which was my idea."" I'd love to hear about your trip direct 
from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and 
killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write 
back....if you can still move your fingers.

948,"Dave thanks for your comments. Following your sequence please note the 
following;

Agreed we can have multiple copies of the GTCs. From a practical perspective 
we will only be trading with Counterparties under ISDA Master Agreements 
which have detailed credit provisions
I do not believe it is necessary for to register EnronOnline as a business 
name. However, I have given instructions to price registering it as a trade 
mark.
The domain is being registered by us.
There are requirements we must follow under the Exempt Market Declaration as 
to whether it is appropriate or not to trade with a particular counterparty. 
If Enron Australia Finance PtyLtd. is the counterparty these obligations 
remain irrespective of the location of the counterparty. It is our 
understanding that this process will performed in Australia.  These 
obligations are summarised in paragraph 4.7 of the advice. 
The use of the term ""firm"" is not an issue as far a contract formation is 
concerned. However I have made some suggestions about the context this term 
is used in our presentation material. Prices quoted are ""firm"" with certain 
qualifications. Assuming the 2 reasons given in the on screen explanation are 
only reasons why an offer could be rejected then there is no problem.
Agreed, the new words should outside the brackets.
At this stage we were planning to continue the current confirmation practice. 
Assuming the requisite degree of comfort of counterparties then we could move 
to a reliance on EnronOnline confirmations.
Conceptually   a non-ISDA Master Agreement could be developed. This would 
present some difficulties because the industry conventions incorporate the 
19992 ISDA Master Agreement as a basis. Any reason why we would want to move 
to a non-ISDA form?     

As a next step we are now moving to settle the advice. When I will circulate 
this final copy I will include a list of action items. None of these appear 
time critical for implementation but for completeness should closed off. For 
example we have produced a definitive explanation as to the records that 
would need to be available if were required to prove the terms of a contract 
in court. Whilst I'm sure these records are available I would like some one 
familiar with the system to confirm this.

958,"Dear Arfan

Thanks for all your effort.

We're working on a content deal that will give us as much sports news as we 
want.  Until we can launch this second phase of EnronOnline, we'll have to 
rely on other third party content for general news items (as in Europe).  As 
best I understand it, this occasional news will be placed on the site at our 
discretion--Julie Ferrara will be responsible for publishing North American 
content, and I'm responsible for European content.  So if there's something 
on that everyone's talking about (Football?), then we could publish a news 
item, if we'd like.

As for the legal issue, I spoke with Mark Taylor (lawyer for Enron North 
America) over a month ago, and he (correct me if I'm wrong, Mark!) seemed to 
differentiate between 'public domain' content and 'proprietary' content, the 
difference between the two being whether or not you could possibly get the 
information from any other source.  I think sports scores is usually in the 
'public domain' category.

So let's keep up the good work, and if you want to prepare a possible 
football related news item, let's move towards publishing it (always going 
through the normal channels, of course).

Thanks Arfan

Welcome back!!
 
I was in New York last week reviewing the current contractual situation on 
our metals contracts and in discussions with Craig Young he mentioned that 
they had some Canadian customers as well as some in Mexico and I believe 
Peru, Chile and Brazil. In respect of the Canadian clients it was his 
understanding that the fact that the MG entity carrying out the business did 
not have an office in Canada was material. I am not sure of the regulatory 
implications of having customers outside of the US, or inside for that 
matter, but thought it would be something that you might need to investigate 
further with Craig.
 
In addition, as part of the Rudolf Wolf acquisition, we have a trader based 
in New York, who is employed by Enron Trading Services Inc, executing deals 
in London for and on behalf of Turkish clients. I am not sure whether this 
needs to be investigated further, but it sounds like it might require it. 
Again Craig Young has all the relevant details.

Are you or someone in your shop in the loop on the below?  I had one meeting 
with David Dupre about a possible alliance with ERisk, but this has not gone 
any further to the best of my knowledge.  There was also some discussion 
about working with RiskMetrics on some deal.

The NDA for ERisk appears to have been drafted by Adam Tyrell, but there is 
no indication on either of the other documents.  The Reuters agreement looks 
somewhat similar to one that I just completed negotiating for EOL.

992,"This will indeed be a St Patrick's Day for us to remember in years to come. 
Now that I am back in the office from Adelaide let me give some more 
considered replies.

It appears there has been a bit a communication mix-up no doubt not helped by 
me being out of the office. So l let me go back to the beginning. Enron 
Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. is authorised to trade Australian power 
derivatives with counterparties so long as it follows certain procedures laid 
out by the Government. These require "" that before entering into a contract 
with a counterparty, the registered facility provider (ie Enron Australia 
Finance) must be satisfied on reasonable grounds:
(a) about the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and
(b) that the counterparty is contracting on its own account."" 

This obligation is imposed on EAF and makes no difference whether the 
counterparty has an Australian presence or not.
 
In the case of EAF there was also a requirement for us to provide 
counterparties with an Enron Corp. guaranty. (Although this strict legal 
obligation
provision was deleted in July 1999.)

 Hence one of the issues that was addressed in our legal checklist  was a 
procedure to vet potential counterparties. We have procedures in place in the 
Sydney office to do this. I understood  that this activity would still be 
done in Sydney ie our list of 26 counterparties. the alternative was to 
develop procedures if it was to done else where.   

On Tuesday we will submitt the formal notification we need to make to the 
Australian Securities and Investments Commission that we are adopting a 
screen based trading system. (This is a legal requirement). Although unlikely 
they may enquire as to our procedures for vetting counterparties.
I was ready to explain there will be a continuation of the same procedures. 

In short there is nothing which needs to be added to extend the GTCs to 
counterparties that do not have an Australian presence. The major sensitivity 
is taxes and withholding tax in particular where the payment is being 
directed outside Australia. On reviewing the subject this evening  I agree 
with Chris Catts there does
not appear to be an issue. But I endorse Heidi's comment that now we know 
that there could be non-resident counterparties (a first for us) lets close 
off the tax 
issue. I have reviewed the various GTCs and probably the attached ECT  
Resources International Corp. GTCs is the most appropriate base to develop an 
appropriate clause. 




Heidi I can reschedule to get some time on Monday to meet with Chris. We 
could hopefully settle the words.  

In the interim  I confirm that the GTCs are satisfactory. David F if you must 
load GTCs Friday (Houston time) then I suggest we go with what we have. I 
would ask for one small change.One small change though. Tana picked up one 
point.  A new paragraph 2.1 (f) should be included as follows. 

""(f)  Subparagragh 2(c) of the ISDA Master Agreement will not apply to all 
Transactions""

993,"Further to discussions with Tana today:

I understand there are some concerns with regard to the amount of time 
necessary to complete the due diligence process on each new company added to 
the EnronOnline customer list.

Tana has requested that we adopt some rules which would reduce the amount of 
time spent on this activity.

I am much in favour of this, but we need to ensure that the rules do not work 
such that many customers are prevented from transacting on products which 
they would otherwise be able to.

e.g. Tana has suggested that companies who are not registered in the U.S. 
should automatically receive a profile which disallows them from trading in 
U.S. physical power, as they are unlikely to hold the required FERC license 
(subject of course to review of individual requests from the companies 
themselves). I am happy with this rule, as it seems highly unlikely that 
non-U.S. companies would hold a U.S. electricity license.

If anyone would like to adopt similar rules for other products, please run 
them past me before implementation - assuming Mark and Justin are OK with the 
concept.

I am aware that early in the EnronOnline process, some GTC's were only 
generated for the ""With Collateral"" category and hence, all companies 
transacting in that commodity were subject to the collateral clause.

I am now starting to wonder if this was an oversight, or if there is a reason

","Frank Joya Davis
	",,
997,"Here is the confirm with the ""out"" built in.
",,,
998,"Dear John:

So sorry for the delay.  I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience.  I 
would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don't have 
your phone number!   Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent:

Part 1 (b)  In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies 
to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$100,000,000.  To accomplish this in the 
schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit 
Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the 
dollar figure adjusted accordingly.

Part 1 (d)  Has Baker & McKenzie recommended this?  We rely on local counsel 
advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a 
bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be.  The risk in the 
automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even 
aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate 
automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not 
able to protect since we are not aware of it.  In the U.S. the bankruptcy 
code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the 
terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge.

Part 1 (e)  We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the 
non-defaulting party the most flexibility.  Market Quotation is often 
suggested because of its apparent objective nature.  However, in many of the 
markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are 
available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives 
flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness).

Part 1 (h)(ix)  This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is 
no collateral annex.   When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for) 
collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the 
Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires 
the posting of collateral to cover any open position.  If the party fails, it 
then becomes a default allowing termination.

Part 1 (h)(x)  Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could 
happen?

Part 2  Have our internal Tax people approved this?

Part 3  I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of 
the corporate documents referred to.  Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit 
Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.?

The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does 
not think it necessary.  In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have 
advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions 
are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business 
and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would 
not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made 
in the corporate documents, etc.

Part 5 (b) (g)&(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind 
(although they may be helpful for other reasons as well).  If neither party 
is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away.  On the other hand, since we are 
choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law 
applies as well.  If that is our theory, there are additional representations 
(the Eligible Swap Participant reps) that we should think about putting back 
in.

Part 5 (d)  We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section 
to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions.  While I think we will get 
there, we haven't actually made the decision yet.  So far I guess we leave it 
the way it is.

Part 5 (j)  My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp. 
guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity.  Any differences in 
Japan from US practice we should be worried about?

Paragraph 13  I have to admit I'm not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 
provisions as the Schedule.  My only concern here is with the MAC clause and 
it looks like there's a glitch in the form.  It seems to me that if the 
counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn't be 
pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us.  The way it is 
drafted now if either S&P or Moody's stops rating us, even if the remaining 
rating is very high we will have a MAC occur.  The counterparty doesn't have 
to worry about Moody's at all.  Just a thought.

On the guaranty, you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction 
changes past Clement Abrams at Corp. Legal.  My only comment is that we would 
usually have a cap that is a bit higher (in this case maybe an extra 
$5,000,000) than the threshold in the CSA - that gives the counterparty a 
little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is 
exceeded.

Tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the 
changes between the US form and the Japan form.  I may have a few more 
comments after I see how that comes out but don't expect many.

I hope this is helpful.  Please feel free to call and we can walk through 
these over the phone if that would be useful.  We should also talk about the 
most efficient way to prepare these going forward.  It might make sense for 
Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft 
which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty.  It 
may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on 
other things.

We're looking forward to having you back.
