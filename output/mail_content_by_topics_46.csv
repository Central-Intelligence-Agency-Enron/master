Thanks for remembering my birthday.  You beat my parents by one day.  

The family is doing fine.  Grace is really smiling.  She is a very happy baby 
as long as she is being held.

It sounds like your house is coming along fast.  I think my folks are ready 
to start building.  

We will probably visit in late June or July.  May is busy.  We are taking the 
kids to Disney for their birthdays.

Good luck on the house.

I will need to close the loan at the title company in Hays County this week.
If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of

Enron cuts shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd due to partnership deal

10/18/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd as the company decided to repurchase 55 mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 
Enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a 1.01 bln usd charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a 618 mln usd loss.
However, the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity dropped to 9.5 bln usd, the company said. 
In an interview, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1.01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Fastow. 
In a conference call yesterday with investors, Lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company ""unwound"" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln. 
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a ""structured finance vehicle"" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. 
The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took. 
Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply, the report said. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. 
Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, ""the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this,"" Causey said. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described the capital reduction ""as just a balance-sheet issue"" and therefore was not deemed ""material"" for disclosure purposes.

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as ""data adequate"" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 
The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.
Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 
GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 
The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 
Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/08/02
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bettis will play in the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. ""There's no question about the next game,"" Bettis said, ""I'll be fine."" Bettis missed Pittsburgh's final five games of the year due to a groin injury, but seems to have healed sufficiently enough to get back into the starting lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=235031&>, RB PHI - The Lie Downs Updated 01/08/02
According to Phillynews.com, Buckhalter will see an increase in playing time behind starter Duce Staley on Saturday against Tampa Bay. Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1140&>, RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 01/08/02
Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. ""He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line),"" Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . ""The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin."" Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries. 

Bills <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. ""My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates,"" Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 01/08/02
Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary. 

Dolphins <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=15&>, DT MIA - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/08/02
Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason. 

Chris Chambers <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=235203&>, WR MIA - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1226&>, WR GB - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns. 

D'Wayne Bates <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. ""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll s! ee! where he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games. 

Jason Brookins <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Not So Nice Machine Updated 01/08/02
Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=187389&>, K OAK - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Cornerback Sha! wn! Springs started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1296&>, WR KC - One Man Show Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown.

Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1294&>, WR STL - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1069&>, QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 01/07/02

Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1149&>, RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=187389&>, K OAK - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1262&>, WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1254&>, WR NE - The Fat Bastards Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1511&>, WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 01/07/02

Cris Carter <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1248&>, WR MIN - The Executioners Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=12400&>, TE KC - The Executioners Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. ! Fu! rther tests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1387&>, K JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 01/07/02
Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1335&>, TE IND - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02

Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win. 

Terrell Davis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 01/07/02
According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here.

Jason Elam <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1383&>, K DEN - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/07/02
According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. ""I've met every goal that I had coming into the season,"" Elam said. ""I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better."" Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

42,"Breaking news:

Leon County circuit Judge Terry Lewis has just rejected a
court petition by Vice President Al Gore to force Florida to
accept hand recounted votes.  This ruling clears the way for
the Florida Division of Elections to certify the final vote
tally tomorrow.

That's great news -- but the post-election battle is not over
yet.

""Hand counting"" of ballots is still going on at this very
minute in Palm Beach and Broward counties.  If the ruling by
Judge Lewis stands, Florida's Division of Elections can
throw out these ""hand counts.""  But the Gore legal team is
appealing the decision today and it's very likely that the
Florida Supreme Court will be hearing the case shortly.

The Florida Supreme Court is comprised of six Democrats and
1 independent, and they've already ruled in Gore's favor to
allow the ""hand counting"" of ballots earlier this week.

Yes, this situation is still a mess.   That's why it's still
important for us to be mobilizing in favor of fair election
practices and integrity in the ballot counting process.  The
votes were counted on election day -- and George W. Bush won
Florida.  The votes were recounted in the days that followed
-- and George W. Bush won Florida.

Now the Democrats have hand picked a couple of counties
where they think they can manufacture enough votes to make
up the difference through ""hand counting"" of ballots.
What's worse is they're using ballot examining techniques
that amount to mind reading to determine whether or not
voters meant to vote for Al Gore.

Thank you for signing your Petition to block these
objectionable ""hand counts"" and Certify the Bush Victory in
Florida.  Every day we pick up more supporters (we're
closing in on 200,0000!) and every day we pick up more media
recognition as we swamp Florida with your Petitions.

Here's the bottom line: we are not going to let Al Gore
steal this election.   Send anyone and everyone who might be
interested in fighting for the integrity of this election to
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com to sign our petition
and see breaking news on the action in Florida right now.

JITTERS IN EUROPE

ITALY'S foreign minister, Renato Ruggiero, resigned after several other
senior ministers had made hostile remarks about the EU and the euro,
and Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, failed to slap them down.
Some European leaders feared Italy's government would turn
Eurosceptical. No way, said Mr Berlusconi, who took on the foreign
ministry himself. But it was clear Italy would defend its national
interests more strongly.

- - - - - See article: Will Italy really change its policy toward the European Union?
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRp0UBQN0T70qZS0Au

Goran Persson, Sweden's prime minister, said his country might hold a
REFERENDUM ON THE EURO next year. Polls suggest that Swedish public
opinion, hitherto hostile, has recently swung in favour of joining the
single currency.

ESTONIA'S market-minded coalition government, led by Mart Laar,
collapsed.

FRANCE'S family doctors stayed on intermittent strike, amid increasing
signs that the government would surrender to their pay demands.

In SPAIN, government-imposed reforms to the country's universities came
formally into force, despite the protests of many academics and
students.

FORCE FOR PEACE

A British-led, UN-mandated, international force designed to provide
security in AFGHANISTAN, was gradually building up to a strength of
4,000-5,000. Turkey and Bulgaria were the latest countries to promise
soldiers. Meanwhile, America said that it intended to build a long-term
Central Asian base in Kirgizstan.

American forces took prisoner 364 men said to be members of the TALIBAN
or the al-Qaeda organisation and proposed to fly them to a camp in the
American base at Guantanamo in Cuba, for questioning. Afghan tribal
leaders protested at the deaths of civilians killed by American bombs,
said to outnumber the 3,000 people who died in New York on September
11th.

In an effort to please India, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan
dropped the term ""freedom fighters"" in a reference to attacks in
Indian-held KASHMIR and said he rejected all terrorism. But India
continued to build up its forces on its border with Pakistan.

- - - - - See article: Islam in Pakistan
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRp0UBQN0T70qZU0Aw

The Pakistani authorities found 630kg (1,390lb) of HEROIN being carried
by a camel caravan in the south-east of the country, one of the largest
seizures of the drug.

MYANMAR'S military government freed five opposition members, including
a cousin of Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader.

A peace-making team from Norway arrived in SRI LANKA at the start of a
new effort to end the 18-year civil war between the separatist Tamil
Tigers and the government.

SHRINKING SURPLUS

As estimates of America's long-term fiscal surplus shrank, Tom Daschle,
the Democratic Senate majority leader, accused President George Bush of
MISHANDLING THE ECONOMY by pushing through last year's $1.35 trillion
tax cuts. Mr Bush promised that ""not over my dead body"" will the
Democrats raise taxes.

- - - - - See article: A battle over numbers
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRp0UBQN0T70qZW0Ay

The Supreme Court reduced the scope of the AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES
ACT by ruling that an impairment must have a significant effect on a
person's daily life in order to qualify as a disability under the law.
The controversial ruling could make it harder for people with
afflictions such as carpal-tunnel syndrome (repetitive-strain injury)
to get special treatment from their employers.

The Bush administration said it may need to resume UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR
TESTING at some point to maintain the safety of its scaled-back
nuclear-weapons arsenal. The option would form part of the
""nuclear-posture review"", which outlines the country's justification
for reducing the number of strategic warheads by two-thirds over the
next ten years.

GOING DOWN

ARGENTINA devalued the peso by 29%25 for most trade and capital
transactions. For other purposes, the currency will float. Eduardo
Duhalde's government converted most dollar loans to pesos, but has said
dollar bank deposits will (eventually) be honoured. Critics feared that
the banking system would collapse.

http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRp0UBQN0T70qZX0Az

CHILE'S president, Ricardo Lagos, appointed as defence minister
Michelle Bachelet, a member of his Socialist party and the daughter of
an air-force general who died after being imprisoned and tortured
during General Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. She is the first woman
defence minister in Latin America.

COLOMBIA'S three-year peace process came to a halt. President Andres
Pastrana gave the FARC guerrillas 48 hours to leave their
""demilitarised"" zone, after they had refused to drop their opposition
to military surveillance of the zone.

BY HOOK OR BY CROOK

ZIMBABWE'S PARLIAMENT was set to pass laws to prevent the presidential
election, due on March 9th and 10th, from being free or fair, or being
won by anyone other than Robert Mugabe. Making doubly sure, the army
chief hinted that he would not recognise the opposition candidate,
Morgan Tsvangirai, if he won.

http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRp0UBQN0T70qZZ0A2

A senior aide to NIGERIA'S chief judge was found dead, apparently
murdered. Bola Ige, the justice minister, was murdered last month.

The South African government promised to set up a commission of inquiry
into the COLLAPSE OF THE RAND. The country's currency lost 37%25 of its
value last year. South African businessmen have accused speculators of
foul play.

The government of BURUNDI promised to pull troops out of Congo in
return for a Congolese promise to stop supporting rebels in Burundi.

After a three-week diminution in the violence between ISRAEL AND THE
PALESTINIANS, Israel seized a ship allegedly carrying weapons to
Palestinian militias, and two Hamas gunmen attacked an army base,
killing four Israeli soldiers before they themselves died.

60,"Dear InvestorPlace.com Member,

I've just revealed a BRAND-NEW wireless recommendation
to my subscribers, and I'm SO excited about this
opportunity that I want to share the details with you,
too.

You see, wireless growth is simply exploding around
the world -- especially after the September 11
terrorist attacks.  Cell phone giant Nokia, for
example, has skyrocketed 41% just since October
1st...worldwide wireless traffic is projected to grow a
whopping 30% in 2001 alone...China plans to spend $151
BILLION on its telecom infrastructure by 2005...and
that's just the very BEGINNING of what lies ahead for
this monstrous market!

Quite simply, the profit potential is huge, and I want
to make sure that my subscribers -- and now you -- get
a piece of the phenomenal gains ahead.  That's why I'm
so excited about my newest recommendation.  I expect
it to leap 50% in the next 12 months ALONE, and I'm
looking for more incredible gains after that.  Let me
show you why.

First, you might not even know about this, but there
has been an INTENSE tech competition over the last
couple of years for the new digital wireless standard.
That battle is now over -- and this company has WON!
That means their proprietary technology will be used
in most 2.5G cell phones (set to be deployed early in
2002), and in practically ALL of the next generation
3G phones.  That alone is a terrific boon for this
stock...but keep reading, because this opportunity gets
EVEN BETTER.

Not only does this company get paid for every one of
its chips used in 2.5G or 3G cell phones...but it also
gets paid a license fee from every single company that
wants to sell or market a cell phone based on its
winning technology.  And I'm not talking about a
simple one-time fee either-these royalties get paid on
a QUARTERLY BASIS, for as long as the technology is
used.  One day, thanks to the strength of their
technology, I fully expect this company to get paid
for EVERY single cell phone in use!

And with projections for 1.3 billion cell phone
subscribers by 2003 and continued steady growth in the
following years, this is an absolutely EXPLOSIVE
opportunity for my stock.  This is a $42 billion
company growing an incredible 27% per year and
spending an impressive 17% of revenues on research and
development -- EXACTLY the type of commitment to
future growth that makes me so confident they will
maintain their competitive edge and DOMINATE their
market space for years to come.

I can almost guarantee that you'll be kicking yourself
for years to come if you don't buy this stock now.
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU!  I revealed the name of
this company -- including my buy price, target price
and full profit details -- in the December issue of
Technology Investing, which just got released.

we expect to make with this wireless dominator, all

As most of you know, Jeff Skilling created the Associate/Analyst Program in 1990.  This Program is one of his most successful and important contributions to Enron, and will continue as a cornerstone of the Company.  It remains our single most important source of new talent.

The purpose of this memo is to reassure you that the direction, philosophy, and importance of the Program remains unchanged.  As we have said many times, most of our new businesses were created by graduates and members of the Program.  Many of the current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.

Three broad principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.
?	We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.
?	We will have a ""One Enron"" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.
?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron's network of people and systems.

The business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.  We also enjoy the deepest and broadest talent pool we have ever had.  Each and every one of you can be a key contributor to making Enron the World's Leading Company.

71,"Hey Tom and Sally,
 I just wanted to give a status report of my meeting with Louise Kitchen 
yesterday. Four main issues were of Confirm Central were discussed: legal 
loose ends and ramifications, user interface, functionality, and future 
enhancements.

 Starting with the legal aspect Louise wanted Mark Taylor brought into the 
process. She felt his experience from EOL would be useful, and would help 
make any seams between EOL and CL disappear. I am setting up ameeting for 
early next week between Mark T., Mark G., and Alan to get this process 
rolling.
 
 The user interface Louise thought needed some work she definitely did not 
like the colors of the website. She had good comments on how to improve the 
look and feel. We will try to incorporate Louise's suggestions as quickly as 
possible. I am not to concerned about these comments since we have spent the 
last 4 weeks developing functionality and have not yet focused on this issue.

 Louise was happy with the actual functionality of the site. She actually 
said we did an excellent job.
 
 Finally, on future relases she wanted us to focus on Financial & Physical 
Power, Financial & Physiacl Gas in the U.S. She felt that this is a market 
where we could make money, where Enron has enough volume that we could really 
relieve some pain on our counterparties. Other commodities such as Liquids, 
Global Products, Metals, she felt either did not have enough voume to justify 
the business model or would take to long to integrate into CL. As far as 
additional features to the site incorpoating an importing function for CP 
data was high on the list, next was reporting confirmation statistics, 
exporting data, and finally automatching.

Take away message from the meeting was that Louise was extremely happy with 
the site and our progress to date.

I have a potential house for you to see if you are interested. It is very 
large and is in a beautiful location right near Hampstead Heath. The current 
occupiers are moving out most likely at the beginning of April and Enron 
holds the lease until the end of June. The commute is approx 35 mins to the 
office.

It is in an incredible area and is very spacious with a large garden so I 
would recommend seeing it. Cost is o1400 p/w plus I would need to arrange 
furniture which would not be a problem. 

Are you interested and if so, can you see it on Tuesday afternoon? If so, 
what time would be best?

Sorry I can't offer it to you, Sally, but we won't have it long enough unless 
the landlord would allow us to extend which is a possiblity.

",Sheila Mike Galvan Sally,,
87,"Please excuse the long e-mail below - I knew we'd never get a chance to all 
get together, and this is somewhat urgent as I have to complete the Finance 
Committee presentation for the upcoming BOD meeting by the end of next week, 
and it will include trading results for the 1st quarter, reported in 
accordance with the risk management policy.  Due to issues noted below, this 
may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to 
come up with the best quality numbers we can.  I talked to Beth already, and 
MRM met with Chris Abel's group to see if there was a short cut, but our 
joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved 
in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the 
best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the BOD.  
We'll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3/30 #s as of end of the 
day next Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.

As you recall, the February 12th BOD meeting resulted in a clarification that 
the BOD approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups 
defined, and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with 
that limit structure (management reporting can be different of course).  
Chris Abel's global energy operations group has prepared a ""RAC"" DPR that 
attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk 
management policy, so that top management and the BOD can see Enron's 
exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis.    (A)  This DPR 
will not impact actual sharing of P/L from a management reporting/business 
unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and 
reporting to the BOD.  But commercial management will need to review and sign 
off on the RAC DPR and monitor limits accordingly, as these limits are at an 
Enron level.

The specific trading results we need for the BOD presentation are the first 
quarter P/L and average daily VaR, by commodity group.  The first RAC DPR 
available is as of 3/30 - so while it has cumulative P/L, VaR is only as of  
3/30.  (Note - we're also comparing to 1Q 2000, but we're not going to 
attempt to resolve cross-commodity reporting for that period except at a high 
level).

Your participation is needed in resolving: 1) cross-commodity reporting per 
the new RAC DPR - both retroactively for the 1st quarter, and going forward, 
and 2) ROVAR (return on average daily VaR by commodity group) for the 1st 
quarter.  This aggregation of cross-commodity activity has been completed by 
Chris as of 3/30, so he has what he believes to be P/L aggregated for the 
quarter in accordance with the policy. What we don't have is VaR on a daily 
basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on 
3/30.  Obviously we're not going to be able to go back and calculate daily 
VaR for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner - 
especially within a week.  So it appears we'll need to ""swag"" average daily 
VaR - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3/30, by 
considering cross-commodity activity you're aware of that took place 
throughout the quarter, and using our best estimate of the impact on VaR for 
this cross commodity activity.  

Due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices, we feel a certain 
level of due diligence is required for us to  feel confident we're reporting 
to the BOD in accordance with the policy. And since we only have a few days, 
I thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt 
resolution of material issues, and then you and Chris' group can work out 
your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit.  
When you consider materiality, please involve your Market Risk contact - 
while a transaction/position/book may not be material to gas or power, it may 
be material to Global Products,  Weather, etc..

Would you please help us with the following:
? Confirm your review of Chris' aggregation on the RAC DPR at 3/30 (Chris' 
staff can walk you through)
? are all the cross-commodity positions you're aware of being reported 
correctly?
? is there other cross-commodity activity not present at 3/30 and 
consequently not aggregated for the quarter's results, but actually present 
during the first quarter and material? If so, estimate impact on P/L and 
average daily VaR.
? we're not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can 
simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity 
to get a feel, and if they point on specific material transactions, we can 
address those; you can determine best approach
? are there certain books in RisktRAC that have cross-commodity positions 
imbedded/combined - either held currently or those that generated significant 
VaR or P/L during the quarter?  Going forward these will need to be reported 
separately to facilitate risk reporting, but in the next week what we need is 
an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities, or a conclusion 
that the impact is immaterial.
? Once you've reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the RAC 
DPR and per your own knowledge, help us estimate the impact on the respective 
commodities' average daily VaR for the quarter - you can discuss with your 
market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable ""swag"" approach.


After considering the information above, please provide your assessment on 
whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross-commodity 
activity, and if not, identify the issues involved and whether it is 
something that market risk needs to address, or if it will simply take more 
time to resolve the reporting details.

If you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading 
results for the quarter, please feel free to pursue those.  I do not mean to 
imply I know how to do your jobs, or that you're not doing them - I simply 
want to coordinate with you to ensure the #s we report to the BOD are the 
numbers you agree with, and that if they're not completely accurate given 
recent implementation, that we are able to articulate and estimate the 
potential misstatement, if any.  As you are the experts on your businesses' 
results, I simply wanted to make sure I closed the loop with what we in MRM 
understand regarding your reporting of the cross-commodity activity and 
trading results and the application of the policy.

On a separate note, we need you to identify P/L related to special 
transactions that flowed through the DPR, but do not really represent trading 
activity - examples in the past are SFAS 125 transactions and other unique 
gain/loss events - we're reporting 1Q 2001 and 1Q 2000, so whatever we can 
recall about last year will also be considered. We will be sending you a 
reconciliation from the DPR to the BOD package that we use to document any 
special adjustments, and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement 
on adjustments to the DPR reporting to derive true trading activity. These 
adjustments should be minimal, but we'd like your input to conclude.

(A)  For example, North American Electricity limits represent Enron's 
consolidated NA Electricity trading activity, without regard to which 
business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds 
positions. So if Power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons, 
these gas trades need to be removed from Power VaR and P/L and combined with 
Gas' VaR and P/L, etc..  Heating oil positions held outside Global Products 
should be aggregated with Global Products; Global Products' positions in gas 
and power should be aggregated with gas and power, with corresponding 
adjustment to Global Products' results.

as the spot I am sure that we can find something good.  We were in Ashville a 
couple of years ago, which was very near the Blue Ridge.  We stayed at a 
place that was supposed to be terrific, but we did not care for it.  I am 
sure that there are other places in the area to research.  There may also be 
some spots around Charlottesville, also just off the Blue Ridge.  I think 
that some people from here have vacationed in that area, so I will ask around 
and see if there are any good suggestions.  In magazines, I have seen 
pictures of places in Tennessee and Georgia ( I guess they do have mountains)

hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to 
provide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out, 
that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the 
Calgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand 
how mistakes continue to happen.  While I know that they can't appreciate the 
vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still 
need to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe 
enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers 
pretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's 
put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings 
with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their 
perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because 
she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob

			   THE NEW EXECUTIVE REPORTS VIEWER

					         http://erv.corp.enron.com

The Global Risk Management Operations group has redesigned the Executive Reports Viewer website to be more efficient and robust enough to accomodate the growing number of reports and users utilizing the viewer.  

The Viewer's new functionality includes:

-An easier to view home page with all reports grouped by Business Unit
-Enhanced security features allowing publisher's to assign security to sections of a report
-Capability of directly emailing the publisher of a report with any questions
-Improved ability to access reports using links and a calendar function
-Comprehensive list of publishers for all reports
-Email notification to viewers when reports are published
-Business links connecting you to industry websites for additional market information
-Report history up to one year, opposed to the former 30 day limit


The old website will close down on July 23rd.  Reports will be published to both sites until then.

Please contact Chris Abel, x33102, Anita Luong, x36753 or Shona Wilson, x39123, with any questions.

is that if it were to come from Louie or me it would have to go to a Koch 
lawyer, who in turn would just tell me to have my enviro guy speak directly 
to their's (which is what they've done in the past.)  In the past, having 
Gary Fuller deal directly with Van Ryn allowed us to better move the ball 
forward.  Lawyers I think should not tangle on this until we reach an impasse 
or other sticky situation.  In my opinion, bringing lawyers in too early just 
results in a flurry of paper back and forth, but not much gets done.

But however you want to do it, we'll do it.

158,"Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.",Copp swain Franz Houston Ballet William atre Imp Karen Dacko Frederic Franklin Peter Farmer Anne Heaton Desmond Heeley Carl Cunningham,,"AZURIX ENRON Corporate Sponsors Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre

162,"On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was 
suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows:

 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 
2-10.84 drip locations

The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above 
PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000.  

I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their 
C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs 
to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision 
is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done 
during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also 
need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology 
to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes 
to 36"".  

One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas 
compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were 
found at regulated levels.....

In general, you are correct that the salary basis test must be met before 
someone can be classified as exempt.  However, because there are certain 
exceptions to the salary basis test (for example, licensed attorneys do not 
have to meet that test), it depends on what the employees are doing as to 
whether this situation creates a problem under the FLSA.

My recommendation would be to obtain information about the jobs performed by 
these 29 employees so that we can determine whether there is an issue.  If 
they do not fit within one of the exceptions, we probably should have them 
affirmatively report time so that hours worked over 40 can be paid at the 
overtime rate. You would use the hourly rate they are paid to determine the 
overtime rate.  If they are not working over 40 hours in a week, it will not 
be an issue.

Let me know if you have questions.

I have just learned that the Holland Club event will overlap with this event by about 30 minutes -- St. Nicholas arrives at 10:30, so Cameron probably wouldn't get his gift until 11:00 at the earliest.  Also, since it is out in the boonies, it would take a while to get back inside the loop.  

Would it be possible for us to arrive late?  I'd hate to create a disturbance, but I think Cameron would like to attend both things.

Thanks!

Michelle

189,"Carol. I spoke with lara robinson this morning. She indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agmt covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made. She also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released. Even if the person never returns due to a conversion to LTD she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees. Seems unusual to me. Would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience. My number is 713-218-7155. Thanks. Michelle

199,"Romantic hideaways need not be lacy and frilly. A perfect example is the Ice House. This is possibly the most unusual, yet delightfully romantic hotel in the world.

What's so special about it? It's made entirely from ice! The floor? Made of ice. The ceiling? Ice. But the bed? You got it - ice! Top to bottom, total ice.	

The Ice House, which has several rooms, is comfortably warm, though I wouldn't recommend going barefoot. Guest accommodations are nice and cozy, with oversized, plush comforters keeping visitors toasty throughout the night. Dozens of candles are the only source of light. They're everywhere - small ones peak out of icy nooks and tall ones stand at attention on the floor. They reflect off the surrounding ice, creating a surreal effect. And even though the light comes from open flame, no, the ceiling doesn't drip on you.

Though a weekend of winter whimsy may be romantic to some, others' idea of a romantic getaway involves warm ocean breezes. In Bali, it's not rare for private villas to be completely open to the soothing winds. Guests drift to sleep with a majestic starlit sky for a ceiling and the soothing sound of waves breaking against the beach to lull them into dreamland. If the warm breezes and sounds of the ocean are still not romantic enough, guests can order all their meals in - or, in this case, is it out?

Regardless of which dream hideaway you prefer, a sanctuary that provides total tranquillity and allows us to forget our ""real"" lives is the perfect romantic setting.

Though you can spend a lot of time and money creating your own romantic hideaway, there really is no set price tag for creating a personal retreat. It can cost next to nothing, and you can create it in your own home.

What's your most romantic room - typically the bedroom. Not romantic enough? Critique it. What's right? What's wrong? The room definitely needs some thought and a theme. Without a theme, we tend to wander, lose focus, and end up with a hodge-podge.

Then think back to all the romantic locations you've ever visited or wanted to visit. What was it that lingered in your mind and tugged at your heart? Then ponder, ""is there anything like that I can bring into my life?"" 

To start, begin with a favorite fabric and an exquisite bed or chair and expand from there, ingredient by ingredient. Don't be afraid to bring in fantasy. Yes, fantasy can be in good taste, classic but with a sense of romance. Done correctly, no one will know exactly what your theme or inspirations were. Stay subtle, don't let the room or any part of it scream at you. This way you'll find that you will probably enjoy it for years to come...

Remember, above all, have fun!


Tips By Julee!!!

Tip #1. Bored with winter? Invite a friend over (how about your spouse?) for a traditional afternoon tea. Prepare English tea sandwiches made from watercress, egg salad and cucumber and serve freshly-baked scones topped with Devonshire cream and preserves. Serve with black tea (capful of vanilla) or Jasmine tea. Entertaining a friend with children? Serve young ones hot chocolate, scones and sandwiches of Nutella and bananas (yum!) or ham and cheese. 

Tip #2. Sunny windows destroy fabric and fade paint. Remedy? Keep the view while protecting your furnishings from harmful UV rays. Have glass ""film"" applied to your windows. There are several choices for degrees of darkness and color. Survey says? People are raving about it!

Tip #3. A room with no windows? Create an illusion with a pair of French doors. Attach them to the wall with gathered fabric hanging behind. Build window seats on either side with a wall-to-wall mirror above each seat. Then paint the walls a light and glossy color to give the room a light and airy feel.


Questions to Julee

Could you tell me the formula used for lamp lighting? How high should the lamp be on a table beside a sofa? On a bedside table? Which is better for reading, a floor lamp with the illumination coming from the top (like a torchiere) or from below (with a traditional shade)?

It is unwise to apply a diehard rule or formula, because the styles of the lamp, the table and the sofa or chairs all contribute to the total picture. Plus, there is more than just function involved. Common sense tells us to be sure the reading light (as opposed to general or accent lighting) is intense and focused on your reading material not on your face. Try out a few lamps until you find one that works.

Ideally, a three-way light is most functional. One turn of the switch shoots (general) light to the ceiling, another turn directs light down and a third, even brighter, allows for tasks. These are often torchieres.


I love the natural looking tortoiseshell (or matchstick) blinds I've been seeing. However, my drapes are floral and are hung from a pewter rod. Are they a good match or are the blinds too rustic for my existing d?cor?

Yes, it is possible to combine tortoiseshell blinds with fabric. Two successful examples would include (a) a patterned fabric in a larger scale than the tortoise, but in the same tone (not darker or lighter colors), or (b) a solid fabric (no obvious pattern) but very textured (nubby) with any color from a natural pallet.


I have adjacent rooms and would like to paint one red and the other blue. Would this interrupt the flow? What do you recommend for accessories and window coverings so these spaces, which open to one another, work well?

First, be certain that your blue and red paints are from the same ""season."" For example don't use a winter red with a spring blue. Next pick a neutral color that goes well in both rooms. Add a little red into the blue room and blue into the red room and use the neutral color in both. When adding the neutral and the opposing colors to the main color, remember to keep their use minimal. Their purpose is as accent colors and they should be used only in trims, borders, frames, linens, or accessories. The red room should remain primarily a red room.

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the ""DART flag"" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

 To all persons on the Service List in I.99-07-003 (Gas Structure
OII):

 As part of the approved Gas Structure settlements for PG&E and the
Comprehensive Settlement proposed for SoCalGas and SDG&E, SoCalGas and PG&E
would contract with Altra Energy Technologies (Altra) to develop several new
electronic trading services including anonymous imbalance trading, OFO
imbalance rights trading, storage trading and anonymous capacity trading.
Recently, while working on finalizing contracts to provide these services,
Altra informed both SoCalGas and PG&E that they are no longer interested in
offering these new services.  Altra restructured their business and has
determined that this service is not the right business direction for them at
this time.

 SoCalGas and PG&E were working together to provide a consistent
service prior to the announcement by Altra, and we will continue working
together to seek an alternative service provider for these services.  PG&E's
intention is to investigate the possible alternatives and to present those
alternatives to the parties to I.99-07-003 along with our suggested plan of
action as soon as possible.  PG&E understands that SoCal Gas intends to work
with parties in a similar fashion.  Since it is unknown how long it will
take a service provider other than Altra to develop these services, the
implementation dates for trading services by a third party will need to be
reevaluated once a selection is made and a development schedule set.

 We recognize that a replacement service provider raises a number of
questions such as implementation costs and service fees.  We will attempt to
address those questions as we investigate the alternatives.  Please send any

QATAR: Qatar, Dolphin final gas pact not seen before Sept.

04/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DUBAI, April 22 (Reuters) - Qatar and Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL) are moving 
ahead on a landmark deal to channel Qatari gas to the UAE, but a final 
development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) may not be struck until 
September, industry sources said on Sunday. 
Qatar and DEL, majority owned by the United Arab Emirates' Offsets Group 
(UOG), in March signed a ""commercial term sheet agreement"" for the 
long-awaited $3.5 billion project.
Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah said at the signing ceremony he 
expected a DPSA to be signed in June. 
Industry sources now say that target date looks ambitious and expect the 
final DPSA and general sales agreements to be in place after the summer. 
Qatari officials, while admitting the final signing could be some months off, 
said Doha was ready to put pen to paper. 
""From our side there is nothing much left that remains to be finalised,"" a 
senior Qatar Petroleum (QP) official closely involved with the deal told 
Reuters. 
""The term sheet is comprehensive and lays down all the conditions of the 
development and production sharing agreement."" 
Analysts said a PSA of Dolphin's scale typically would take about a year to 
finalise, but the pace would be quicker with this project since key details 
already had been hammered out. 
Asked whether signing of the PSA could be delayed, the Qatari official said: 
""It could be from their (DEL's) side, but not from us."" 
""It is for them (DEL) to organise and put things in place at their end,"" the 
official added. ""As far as we are concerned, we are prepared to sign the PSA 
for two billion cubic feet a day (cfd) of gas as and when they are ready."" 
UOG declined comment. 
UOG currently owns 51 percent of DEL, with the remainder held equally by U.S. 
Enron Corp and France's TotalFinaElf. 
While the finishing touches are being put on the deal, industry sources said 
new potential foreign investors are sizing up DEL's prospects. 
The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North 
Field and produce up to two billion cfd of gas. 
UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the North Field tract, drilling and 
setting up production facilities. 
The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up 
receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi. 
First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or 
early 2005. About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be 
consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi with the remainder supplied to Dubai.

INDIA: Enron's Indian unit directors to meet on April 25-paper.

04/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, April 22 (Reuters) - The directors of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 
Indian unit are scheduled to meet on April 25 in London to decide on the fate 
of a 2,184 MW power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, a 
local newspaper reported on Sunday. 
The Indian Express said Enron has authorised its representatives and Dhabol 
Power Corporation (DPC) managing director Neil Mcgregor to look at various 
options, including the sale of Enron's stake in Dabhol.
A DPC spokesman in Bombay confirmed to Reuters that the meeting was scheduled 
but did not disclose details. 
The report said a notice of the meeting has been sent to Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board (MSEB) which has a 15 percent stake in DPC. 
A three-member team led by MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal will be attending the 
meeting, the report added. Bansal also confirmed the meeting to Reuters but 
did not divulge details. 
Enron's Indian unit has also called a meeting of its lenders on April 23 to 
discuss the ongoing payment row with India's Maharashtra state government. 
The meeting will be in London and will be attended by international as well 
as local lenders of the DPC. 
Creditors have extended $1.2 billion in loans to finance construction of a 
second phase of the plant, which is expected to begin operating later this 
year, tripling the plant's power output. 
The move comes amid escalating tensions between Enron and Maharashtra over 
the inability of the state's utility to pay its monthly bills. 
MSEB has been defaulting on payments since October for electricity purchased 
from Dabhol's 740 MW power plant on the state's west coast. The amount 
outstanding totals 2.26 billion rupees ($48.24 million). 
In an effort to compel payment, Dabhol has twice invoked a federal government 
guarantee to cover payment defaults by the state utility. 
The dispute has caused Enron to freeze most of its investment plans in India 
and has also affected foreign investment in India's power sector. 
The state government signed a contract in the mid-1990's to buy the plant's 
entire power output. But a rise in the cost of naphtha, the fuel currently 
used to power the plant, and a decline in the value of the Indian rupee 
against the dollar, has inflated the cost of the power produced by the Dabhol 
plant beyond the price expected at the time the contract. 
That has made the power produced by the Enron plant twice the cost of power 
produced by other suppliers in the state, fuelling popular and political 
pressure to scrap the contract.

IN ORDER to resolve the imbroglio over payment crisis between the state 
electricity board (MSEB) and US energy major Enron-promoted Dabhol Power 
Company (DPC), Maharashtra will set up ""an experts"" committee for 
negotiations even as the multinational is contemplating winding up of its 
operations in the country. 
""We are now going for negotiations and will form an experts committee in 
which Maharashtra expects the Centre to participate,"" Chief Minister Vilasrao 
Deshmukh said.
""All the four parties namely the State, Union Government, Enron and MSEB 
should come together for negotiations, otherwise it cannot be a complete 
exercise,"" he added. 
Deshmukh and MSEB team are scheduled to meet Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha 
and Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tomorrow in New Delhi to discuss the 
stalemate and find a ""acceptable solution"" for the same. ""I am meeting Sinha 
and Prabhu to request them to take an initiative and send representatives for 
the negotiations committee,"" he said. 
Deshmukh's meeting with the Centre comes at a crucial stage as DPC's lenders 
would be meeting in London, on the same day, to decide upon the future 
finances of the controversy marred 2,184-MW project in Dabhol. 
Moreover, DPC board is also scheduled to meet on April 25 in London to decide 
the fate of its $900 million project in Dabhol, including winding up of its 
operations. The meeting would discuss the top most item on the agenda, which 
was to empower DPC managing director Neil McGregor to wind operations in the 
country. DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and 
three arbitration notices on the state government over non-payment of dues 
amounting to Rs 213 crore plus interest towards the bills due for the months 
of December 2000 and January 2001. Asked whether the Centre had send any 
feelers over a possible clubbing together of the arbitration and conciliation 
processes, Deshmukh replied in the negative. 
Meanwhile, Power Minister Suresh Prabhu said the Centre will render all 
possible help to resolve the Enron crisis which is haunting the entire 
country. 
Prabhu said he would meet the Vilasrao Deshmukh in New Delhi tomorrow to 
discuss stalemate over the payments dues. 
Bansal had said that MSEB would present its case concerning the Rs 401 crore 
penalty that the loss-making board slapped on DPC.

ONGC disputes Enron's claim on Moon Prospect project at Tapti

04/22/2001
Press Trust of India Limited
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.

New Delhi, Apr 22 (PTI) India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation 
(ONGC) has virtually dismissed the 15 million dollar Moon Prospect gas well 
project at Tapti fields saying there was no substantial recovery contrary to 
claims of a big find by the joint venture (JV) parnter, Enron. 
""Enron, which is the operator of the field, has not shared results of the 
ambitious Moon Prospect gas well project with JV partners - ONGC and 
Reliance. The project seemed to have turned into a hollow gas well,"" senior 
ONGC officials said.
Significantly, the setback on Moon Prospect comes at a time when Enron has 
put its 30 per cent stake in the JV on the bloc. 
ONGC has 40 per cent stake in the 900 million dollar venture while Reliance 
has 30 per cent stake. Tapti, along with Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, was 
awarded to the consortium of ONGC-Enron-Reliance in 1992 for exploration. 
Enron has claimed 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves in place, of which 
25-30 per cent are recoverable reserves, sources said, adding ""We, however, 
feel there aren't substantial reserves in place for commercial exploitation."" 
After over three months of drilling and spending 15 million dollar, the well 
reached the final depth but not substantial hydrocarbon reserves have been 
struck, they said. 
""Though sophisticated and expensive techniques has been used for drilling and 
logging, so far the well has not brought about any reliable information about 
the possibliy of hydrocarbons,"" sources added. 
There are major differences among the three JV partners over the costs of the 
project, with both ONGC and Reliance alleging that the operator (Enron) was 
working in excess of the limits of the costs specified in the agreement 
though no approval has been given for increase, sources said. 
Differences also exist among the three promoters about the prospects and 
exact reserves in place in Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields, sources 
said. 
While Enron has already has arbitration against ONGC and Reliance for not 
paying the expenses incurred by them, the partners are of the view that Enron 
Oil and Gas India Ltd (EOGIL) is not operating the fields in the cost 
effective way. 
Designed to evaluate deeper hydrocarbon potential of middle-lower, Eocene and 
Paleocene sections, Moon Prospect has been conceived to be highly potential 
with 4-way closure, covering about 5,000 acres, sources said. 
Tapti lies 160 km north-northwest of Mumbai in a water depth of 20 meters. 
The JV has already installed three well platforms, one process platform, one 
flayer platform and intrafield pipeline network. It has drilled 25 wells and 
also installed a gas export pipeline tied to ONGC's pipeline to Hazira.

A
Cyclist injured in MS 150 tour / Rider's condition called critical after 
hitting head

A bicyclist was in critical condition at Memorial Hermann Hospital Saturday 
after falling and injuring his head on a highway near Bellville, officials 
said. 
The 46-year-old man, whose identity was not released, was among about 8,000 
people making the annual BP MS 150 bicycle tour to Austin to raise funds to 
fight multiple sclerosis.
Grace Anderson, a hospital administrator, said the victim, who had been 
brought to Hermann by helicopter, was treated for a head injury and remained 
in critical condition. 
The accident happened just after 11 a.m. outside Bellville in Austin County, 
said Pat Bertotti, president of the Lone Star Multiple Sclerosis Society, 
which sponsors the 180-mile bike tour. 
Details of what caused the accident were not known although Bertotti said the 
man was injured when he was thrown by the force of the accident over the 
handlebars. 
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society's Lone Star chapter sponsors the 
annual bike tour. 
The tour event began at 7 a.m. Saturday, traveling from Tully Stadium, 
Interstate 10 and Dairy Ashford. The bicyclists were expected to start 
crossing the finish line in Austin as early as 10:30 a.m. today. Organizers 
said riders stop overnight in La Grange.

Business
Power price rise stirs furor ; Energy firms deny claims of manipulating 
markets
Michael Liedtke
Associated Press

San Antonio Express-News
Metro

In Houston, it's known as ""the power corner."" Separated by just a few city 
blocks, four major power wholesalers run trading exchanges that have a strong 
influence on energy prices nationwide. 
The trading floors run by Enron Corp., Reliant Energy Inc., Dynegy Inc. and 
Duke Energy Corp. represent ground zero in a power crisis threatening the 
quality of life in much of the western United States this summer.
By seizing upon opportunities created by deregulation, the energy traders 
have turned up the juice in the electricity business in ways similar to how 
junk bond traders ignited Wall Street in the 1980s and venture capitalists 
fueled Silicon Valley last decade. 
And thanks to an exemption granted in the early 1990s, nobody monitors daily 
trading to detect unfair or illegal practices. 
Utility bills in California have gone up nearly fourfold in the past year, to 
$27.1 billion. Without fundamental changes in the energy market, this year's 
bill will rise to $70 billion - more than $2,000 for every person in the 
state, according to operators of the state's power grid. 
The staggering electricity price increases have pushed the state's largest 
utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, into bankruptcy and left No. 2 Southern 
California Edison on the brink of insolvency. California's once-ample budget 
surplus also has shriveled, as the state is spending about $50 million a day 
to buy enough power to keep the lights on. 
The energy wholesalers say they're doing nothing wrong. 
They blame the high prices on the rising price of natural gas, burned to 
generate electricity, and the state's botched deregulation plan. By failing 
to line up reliable power ahead of time and by imposing price caps for 
consumers, the state put itself into this mess, the companies say. 
""There have been accusations of wrongdoing for eight months now, and there 
isn't a shred of evidence to support the allegations,"" said Gary Ackerman, 
executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park, Calif., 
trade group. ""People are very angry and frustrated about electricity right 
now, and attorneys are trying to take that anger out on us."" 
Attorneys general in Washington, Oregon and California are probing whether 
the wholesalers have violated antitrust laws or engaged in unfair business 
practices. A California state senate committee might issue subpoenas for 
records and the testimony of top energy executives, and at least five 
lawsuits accuse energy companies of market abuses. 
""This is the best fraud I have ever seen,"" said attorney Michael Aguirre of 
San Diego, who is involved in one of the class-action suits. ""The generators 
are doing everything that you think that they might be doing, only it's worse 
than you ever imagined."" 
The lawsuits and investigations allege that generators have conspired to 
hijack billions of dollars from consumers and taxpayers by withholding 
electricity from energy-starved California until the last minute, and then 
supplying it at exorbitant prices. 
At Enron's headquarters in Houston, energy specialists among the company's 
1,500 traders swap electricity and natural gas contracts like stocks and 
bonds. Mathematicians, meteorologists and economists make complex 
calculations to identify where to buy the cheapest power and where to deliver 
it at the greatest profit. 
""They are extremely good at what they do,"" said Severin Borenstein, director 
of the University of California at Berkeley's energy institute. 
The Internet has provided the traders with the tools to do their jobs even 
better. Online marketplaces and password-protected exchanges provide them 
with invaluable real-time information on the buying and selling patterns of 
their rivals. 
Two lawsuits allege that traders have parlayed the sensitive information 
collected online to fix prices artificially high, a violation of antitrust 
laws. 
Aguirre has spent six months assembling reams of data about traders and their 
activities, but he has yet to develop concrete evidence to prove his 
price-fixing allegations. 
A March 21 report by California's electricity grid managers concluded that, 
between last May and November, 98 percent of trading bids were driven up by 
noncompetitive patterns of behavior. 
The California Independent System Operator report stopped short of accusing 
wholesalers of illegal market manipulation, but it did determine that the 
wholesalers collected as much as $6.9 billion in ""unjust and unreasonable"" 
rates. 
Enron says its trading system, particularly the online exchange, has resulted 
in fairer and more efficient markets. The allegations of market abuse are 
""just some sour grapes from people who didn't come up with the idea in the 
first place,"" said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. 
The online exchanges and other industry Web sites provide the energy traders 
with a window to see the energy availability and bids in markets around the 
country. 
Power industry critics, however, contend the Web's instant access provides 
the traders a way to exploit a delicate supply-demand balance. If the scale 
is tipped even slightly toward an inadequate supply, they say, prices soar 
and energy traders reap huge gains. 
""The whole trading thing is just a front that lets them game the market,"" 
Aguirre said. ""They can get away with it because no one (outside the 
industry) can figure out what they are doing."" 
Whatever the energy traders are doing, it's not closely monitored by 
government regulators. 
In 1993, the trading of energy products received an exemption from oversight 
by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal agency that oversees 
commodity and options trading to protect markets from fraud and manipulation. 
Energy is the only commodity that has received a blanket CFTC exemption. 
The exemption was shepherded beginning in 1992 by then-CFTC chairwoman Wendy 
Gramm, wife of Texas Sen. Phil Gramm. She left the CFTC three months before 
the exemption received final approval in 1993. That same year, she joined the 
Enron board of directors, a post that last year earned her $50,000. 
Gramm, an economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said 
she doesn't recall talking with Enron about the exemption, which she 
characterized as a routine matter triggered by an antitrust case involving 
crude oil. 
""It really didn't have anything to do with Enron or any specific company,"" 
said Gramm. ""It had to do with a general market problem."" 
In granting the exemption, the CFTC accepted the industry's contention that 
it shouldn't be subjected to the government's usual commodities regulation 
because its markets are dominated by ""large sophisticated commercial 
entities"" capable of protecting themselves - in short, that there would be no 
little people to hurt. 
At the time, then-CFTC commissioner Sheila Bair scoffed at the reasoning, 
comparing energy traders to boiler room sales operations that had the 
potential to violate federal anti-fraud laws. 
""Is it really that much of burden on market participants (for the CFTC) to 
retain a sliver of authority regarding fraudulent activity?"" Bair wrote in a 
dissenting opinion. 
Wholesale electricity prices negotiated by the traders eventually are 
compiled in quarterly reports and reviewed by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission. And while FERC by law is supposed to prevent unfair prices, a 
majority of its commissioners have advocated a hands-off approach to 
California's energy crisis, insisting that the market can correct itself. 
That posture may finally be changing somewhat. Last Wednesday in San Jose, 
Calif., FERC Chairman Curt Hebert told lawmakers that his agency hopes to 
begin ""monitoring and mitigating"" the wholesale electricity market by May 1. 
This could allow FERC to preemptively influence prices. 
Energy economists who have studied the market see signs of ruthless - but 
perfectly legal - behavior. 
Paul Joskow, an MIT economist, concluded in January that electricity 
producers deliberately withheld power to drive up prices. 
""Every business exercises market power when it can, so I don't know why 
people are so surprised that (the generators) used their market power,"" 
Joskow said. ""I didn't see any evidence of collusion in what they did. It was 
just good business."" 
Enron's specific trading methods remain a mystery even to industry analysts, 
partly because the company considers its techniques to be proprietary. But it 
yielded a big payoff last year - an operating profit of $1.6 billion, up 160 
percent from $628 million in 1999. 
When electricity and natural gas prices soared to record highs in the fourth 
quarter, Enron's trading profit more than tripled to $538 million. 
Without providing specifics, Enron officials said the profits poured in from 
all over the country. 
""Our success is linked to efficient markets, not higher prices in California, 
or anywhere else for that matter,"" Steve Kean, an Enron executive vice 
president, said in January testimony before the U.S. Senate. ""What we are 
interested in is competitive and well-functioning markets. Our financial 
success is not built on California's back.""


JUSTIN SULLIVAN/Associated Press Attorney Michael Aguirre stands in front of 
the State of California Building in San Francisco. Aguirre says he has never 
felt more strongly about a case as the one he is pursuing against the power 
wholesalers behind California's high electricity prices.

India Dabhol Pwr Project Shrholders Mtg In London Apr 25

04/21/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co.'s 
shareholders will meet in London April 25 to possibly discuss the future of 
their 2,184-megawatt electric power project in the western Indian state of 
Maharashtra, Enron India's spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires late Saturday. 
Enron Corp. has a 65% controlling stake in the controversial $3 billion 
Dabhol project, which supplies power to the State Electricity Board. The 
project is India's biggest foreign investment. Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board with 15%, General Electric Co. (GE) with 10%, and Bechtel (X.BTL) with 
10% are the other shareholders in the project.
""I confirm that a DPC board meeting will be held in London on April 25. I am 
not in a position to give any more details,"" said Jimmy Mogul, spokesman for 
Enron India Ltd. 
DPC's other shareholders weren't immediately available for comment. 
As reported, a meeting of Dabhol Power Co. lenders is taking place in London 
April 23. The meeting has been called at the initiative of Dabhol Power to 
update its lenders on the current situation of the project. DPC has nearly 40 
lenders that include Indian and international financial institutions. 
Last week, DPC served two notices of arbitration on the Maharashtra state 
government. 
In a statement, Enron India said the notices were served because the 
Maharashtra government had failed ""to honor its obligations under the 
government of Maharashtra State Support Agreement and Supplemental State 
Support Agreement,"" signed in 1994 and 1996, respectively. 
DPC said in the agreements that the Maharashtra government had pledged to 
""support and encourage the further development and completion of the Dabhol 
project."" It added that ""without justification,"" the Maharashtra government 
has gone back on these agreements, which has ""adversely and materially 
impacted DPC's ability to perform under its contractual agreements."" 
The statement added that as part of the arbitration process, an independent 
three-person panel will be set up to determine whether the Maharashtra 
government has ""failed to comply with its obligations."" 
Under a 1996 counter-guarantee agreement, the federal government is obliged 
to pay Enron when MSEB defaults. 
Enron invoked that guarantee in February, marking the first time in India's 
history that a company has invoked a federal guarantee, when the state 
utility said it couldn't afford to pay DPC. The state government finally paid 
$17 million in outstanding bills. 
DPC and the federal government recently started a conciliation process, to be 
governed by the provisions of the U.N. Commission on International Trade Law, 
with the aim of resolving DPC's latest dispute with MSEB. 
DPC says MSEB owes it 1.02 billion rupees ($1=INR46.8150) for power supplied 
in December 2000. For its part, the MSEB said it wanted the power bill to be 
offset against a INR4 billion fine it levied on DPC for what it said was the 
non-supply of power for intermittent periods between October 2000 and the end 
of January. 
Dabhol, India's largest private power plant currently under construction, was 
scheduled for commissioning in two phases. The project's first phase, a 
740-megawatt power plant, has already been commissioned and phase two is due 
to be completed later this year. 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging INR7.1 a kilowatt-hour for its power, 
compared with INR1.5/KWh charged by other suppliers.

I hope that a short note on methodology on accomplishments' valuation will be 
of help to all of us at this stage.  Up to this moment, the current criteria 
is still the same established by Jim, John, and Gia Team in the last two 
years.  Its purpose was, and still, is to ensure that Public Affairs 
continues to generate more value than actual expense.    The process, 
hopefully, should drive GA staff to view themselves as ""originators"" creating 
bottom-line value through (as an example):
revenue enhancement (new opportunity, market expansion)
cost reduction (e.g., fee delay, rate decrease).

The value calculation process focused on the following rules (called SCORE):
Simplicity
Consistency
Objectivity
Reasonableness
Equity

Perhaps it is helpful  to list some of the methodologies submitted so far.  
With no specific preference, they are: 
 A percentage of Enron's business on a specific hub, or transmission 
connection (the percentage is subjectively determined)
 Impact of a specific deal on Enron's stock price (in total or part, again, 
subjectively determined)
 The result of what-if analysis to estimate the would be cost had the 
legislation passed (or did not pass), or a settlement reached (or not reached)
The amount of financing needs that was secured for a deal
NPV of a project.  An extension would be the size of market identified or 
deals originated.
The market size that Enron is targeting.
Value at risk in a specific project or activity
The methodology adopted by the relevant regulatory regimen to calculated  
specific cost item that have been deferred, reduced, or avoided.  An 
extension would be the impact of tariffs determination after intervention (in 
part or total).
The buy/sell spread of a portion of the market size that was released after 
intervention.

I shall keep you posted with any change--in any case, it  shall not happen 
without full consultation with you--meanwhile, please let me know if you have 
any question in this regard.

228,"California fails to find illegal acts -- An investigation by California's
attorney general and state utility regulators into alleged illegal behavior
by electricity generators has failed to turn up evidence of criminal
behavior, persons familiar with the probe said Monday. The sources -
including two commissioners on the California Public Utilities Commission
and an aide to Attorney General Bill Lockyer - said generators aren't likely
to be prosecuted, even though it appears they did withhold supply, and that
the state may pursue civil remedies as an alternative. Jason Leopold, Dow

Natural gas powered generators run at capacity -- California power plants
that burn natural gas to generate electricity will be allowed to run at full
capacity over the next several months under an executive order by Governor
Gray Davis. The order, signed by Davis today, is intended to help prevent
blackouts by allowing plants fired by natural gas to exceed their
air-emission limits. Millions of Californians lost electricity during six
days of blackouts this year as demand for power outstripped supply. Daniel

El Paso gas probe broadened -- Federal energy regulators broadened their
investigation of El Paso Corp. to include charges that one company unit
showed favoritism to another in awarding a contract that, plaintiffs say,
allowed El Paso to manipulate California natural-gas prices. The company's
pipeline subsidiary, El Paso Natural Gas, last year sold 1.2 billion cubic
feet of capacity to the company's merchant energy unit, which makes money by
trading electricity and natural gas. The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission is investigating whether the trading unit then withheld gas from

Paying over-market for power -- California paid hundreds of millions of
dollars above average market prices for electricity in the first quarter as
the state bought high-cost power to avoid blackouts, Bloomberg statistics
show. California, the largest power buyer in the U.S., said it paid an
average of $285 a megawatt hour in the first quarter. The average daily
market price was about $248 in northern California and $211 in southern
California, Bloomberg data indicate. That suggests the state paid between
$492 million and $985 million over market. The state bought 13.31 million
megawatt hours in the period. David Ward at bloomberg.com

California natural gas prices -- The price of natural gas sold into Southern
California has fallen sharply the last week after both the free fall in
electricity prices and the expiration of a pipeline contract held by the El

The change in prices has prompted critics of El Paso to suggest that the
drop shows how much effect the company's contract had in keeping natural gas
prices high. The story is in the New York Times

scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. They
recently calculated the effect of an atmospheric increase of 2 to 4 degrees
Celsius in the next 60 years--a rate of global warming that many experts
consider highly likely. Nancy Vogel in the Los Angeles Times

intimate knowledge needed to manipulate California's troubled energy market.

electricity, a significant drop from the $90 million a day California
shelled out when energy supplies ran especially short this spring. Andrew

market prices for electricity and natural gas was a ""temporary reprieve,""

230,"Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to 
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond 
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt 
from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from 
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services 
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it 
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but 
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by 
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying 
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only 
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from 
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took 
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the 
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree 
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create 
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include 
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what 
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with 
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it 
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to 
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short 
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby 
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity 
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to 
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches 
to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct 
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that 
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if 
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and 
passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Best,
Jeff",Burton Hertzberg,,"Hertzberg Direct Access DWR ESP PUC Direct 
Access"

Testimony before Senate Energy, Utilities & Communications Committee And the

By Terry M. Winter, President and CEO
California Independent System Operator
August 10, 2000




An August 10th article from Natural Gas Intelligence that talks of the 
defensive posture the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) has 
taken concerning the accusations that Governor Davis' emergency electricity 
report had made about the new deregulated market. 



An article from Natural Gas Intelligence talks about the vote, on July 31st,  
by the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) Board to move the 
price cap to $250. The pros and cons of the price cap are mentioned, as well 
as other remedies for the power situation. Also, there are several comments 
in the article from California Senator Steve Peace on how ""dysfunctional"" the 
market is and why it should be restructured.

The Fourth Annual Peterson Ethics Lecture
Featuring: William Drayton
Founder of Ashoka, an organization that supports social entrepreneurship

This Friday, October 12, 4:00 pm, Wells Fargo Room
Haas School of Business


About William Drayton:
Drayton founded Ashoka in 1980 to use a venture capital model to support 
social entrepreneurs, described by Ashoka as practical visionaries who are 
committed to social change. The primary activity of the organization is 
identifying social entrepreneurs around the globe as candidates for Ashoka 
Fellowships, which provide both financial and professional support. To be 
chosen, each prospective fellow goes through a rigorous search and 
selection process.

Fellows receive a living stipend (typically for three years) and they join 
the Global Fellowship -- a worldwide network of social entrepreneurs. This 
year, Paul Rice, MBA 96, was named an Ashoka Fellow for his work founding 
TransFair USA, a non-profit certification organization for Fair Trade 
products.

Since 1982 the organization has elected over 1,100 Ashoka Fellows in 41 
countries. Ashoka Fellows work in six areas: learning/education, 
environment, health, human rights, civic participation, and economic 
development. Approximately 150 new fellows are elected each year by the 
Ashoka staff.

About the Peterson Ethics Lecture:
This annual lecture is sponsored the Peterson Program in Business Ethics, 
funded by a gift from Rudolph Peterson, BS 25, president and CEO emeritus 
of BankAmerica Corporation. Last year Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, 
then director and chairman of Alcoa, gave the lecture.

257,"I am visiting Haas this year and will be teaching 'European Financial
Markets' (BA 296-7, E 296-5) in the spring. Since this is a new course,
I thought I should draw it to your attention. The move to monetary union
(EMU) in Europe has created a newly integrated financial area comparable
to the US, with consequences that anyone doing business or advising
businesses in Europe needs to understand. Just consider:

'The dollar's supremacy has been challenged in the global debt markets.'
(FT, 6/14/99).  'The large funds have indulged in a frenzy of
cross-border buying...with the volume of paper launched by European
companies rising five-fold over 1998.' (FT 10/28/99)   '...a doubling of
European-based staff at Lehman Brothers, a 50% increase at SSB, and up
to 20% at other banks...follows Europe overtaking the US in M&A
activity...' (FT 10/25/99)

I shall address questions such as: How does the European Central Bank
differ from the Fed? Will the euro compete with the dollar as an
international currency? Can European capital markets challenge the US
for international portfolio managers and for non-European issuers? Will
Europe soon have serious venture capital and junk bond sectors? Will the
European banking sector experience a deep wave of cross-border
restructurings? Will there be a shift from domestic to cross-border M&A
in Europe - and will competition authorities try to restrain it? How
will the East European emerging markets fit into the picture?

If these issues interest you, I look forward to seeing you in January.

263,"Word on the street is that the CA ISO staff is NOT asking for a vote on price 
caps at the Board meeting on Thursday.  (I was speculating that the Board 
would be asked to lower the price caps to $100 or to adopt the CEO's 
proposal, which he filed at FERC on 10/20.)  The vote will be put off a vote 
until late November.  No reason given -- but presumably so they don't look 
like idiots if FERC comes out with something radically different on November 
1.

But, I have also heard that one Board member -- Mike Florio of TURN -- has 
asked for a vote on his proposal -- load-differentiated price caps (e. g.$250 
when area load is 40,000 MW or more, $150 when load is between 30,000 and 
40,000, etc.) If a few Board members, i.e., the utilities and some of the 
munis gang up, they can force a vote.  I'm expecting one, but given the 
staff's/CEO position, there may not be sufficient votes to go lower until 
FERC comes out with its proposal.

Maybe small miracles can happen in California ...","Mike Florio e. g.$250

THE ENRON fiasco would not dampen the interest of foreign investors who see=

India as a long term investment destination, AT Kearney vice president and=

said.=20
He felt that the fallout of the Enron controversy would not have major=20

Laudicina, who is in India on Monday to address several meetings of the=20
businessmen, told ET in an interview that Enron should not be seen as an FD=

""Infrastructure bottlenecks and bureaucracy are major hinderances to inflow=

Laudicina, however, cautioned that it was for the Indian government to ensu=

that the Enron controversy would not result in negative perception among=20
investors who did not ""know"" the country. ""The authorities need to address=

the issue frankly instead of putting on false positive face.""=20
Further the two parties involved Enron and the government should deal with=

the issue in forthright manner.=20
AT Kearney had reported early February that India was one of the four hot=

would not have negatively impacted the countrys attractiveness to the forei=

Foreign investors, he felt, were looking for large market size and potentia=

India could continue to attract FDI inflows due to its strengths but the=20

India May Allow Generators to Retail Electricity, Paper Says
2001-07-24 02:01 (New York)


     New Delhi, July 24 (Bloomberg) -- India's government may ask
parliament to pass a law allowing generators to sell power
directly to companies and big housing estates, the Business
Standard reported, citing Power Ministry officials it didn't name.
     Only state electricity boards are now allowed to retail power
that the boards buy from state and non-state generators. If
generators are allowed to retail power to large buyers, customers
would be taxed to help pay for subsidized supplies to villages and
rural consumers, the paper said.
     The Electricity Bill 2001 may be introduced during
parliament's five-week session that began yesterday, the paper
said.
     AES Corp., a U.S. power generator, said last week it wants to
pull out of a power distributor in eastern Orissa state that's
owed $45 million in past-due bills because of power thefts and
refusals to pay.
     Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, and a state
electricity board in India's western state of Maharashtra have
been quarrelling for seven months over $64 million of unpaid
bills.
     At least five overseas utilities, including Electricite de
France, Europe's largest, have pulled out of Indian power projects
worth $3 billion over bureaucratic delays, slow deregulation and
payment problems.

Enron Should Be Fined by California Senate, Committee Says
2001-07-23 21:19 (New York)

Enron Should Be Fined by California Senate, Committee Says

     Sacramento, California, July 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
the world's largest energy trader, should face escalating fines
levied by the California Senate until it complies with requests
for trading records, a legislative committee said.
     In a report to the full Senate, the Senate Select Committee
to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market
suggested Enron be fined $1,000 initially. The fine should double
each day the Houston-based company fails to comply with document
requests, the committee said.
     ``Enron is and has been an active participant in the
California wholesale-energy market,'' the report said. ``The
subpoenaed documents are pertinent to the select committee's
investigation.''
     The committee is investigating allegations that power
generators and traders manipulated California's electricity market
to artificially boost prices. Enron and other companies have said
repeatedly that they acted within the law.
     ``We were rather surprised by it (the committee report),''
said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. ``We've been negotiating in
good faith with the committee and had made a good deal of progress
in the last week.''

                    Contempt Allegations

     The committee has twice found Enron in contempt for failing
to supply documents the committee has requested. On July 11, when
the committee voted the second time, committee Chairman Joseph
Dunn said he wouldn't deliver the contempt report to the full
Senate if the documents were turned over. Dunn, a Democrat from
Santa Ana, delivered the report Saturday.
     Enron has agreed to turn over more than 1 million documents
to the committee, Denne said. The company doesn't have an
agreement on the Senate maintaining the confidentiality of the
documents, nor on lawmakers' jurisdiction over documents not kept
in California, she said.
     Before the full Senate votes on the report, it must be taken
up by the Senate Rules Committee, said Alex Montgomery, a
consultant to Dunn. The committee is likely to take up the issue
when the Senate returns from its month-long summer recess in late
August. The report's proposed fines are intended to bring Enron
into compliance with the document requests, Montgomery said.
     ``It really is meant not to punish them, but to get them to
comply with the subpoena,'' she said. ``We would really prefer not
to be in this process.''
     On July 11, Enron sued Dunn's committee to quash the subpoena
for documents. In the lawsuit, Enron said that federal regulators
have sole jurisdiction over wholesale-energy trading and that the
committee's subpoena is too broad. Enron will continue to pursue
the suit, Denne said today.

Enron=01,s Ken Lay On Energy and Boards=20
Corporate Board Member Magazine, Summer 2001
by Ann Reilly Dowd  </contact_us/contact_form.shtml?Ann_Reilly_Dowd>

California may have asked for it, says this White House insider, but=20
everybody should be part of the solution=01*including directors who should=
=20
ensure their companies have an energy strategy.

When Vice President Dick Cheney sought input in formulating a national ener=
gy=20
policy, one of the people he listened to most intently was Kenneth Lay,=20
chairman of Enron and a longtime George W. Bush supporter. In 15 years Lay,=
=20
57, has turned a traditional pipeline company into an aggressive trader of=
=20
gas and electricity and a provider of broadband services. Until the deal=20
bogged down, it looked last year as though video rental giant Blockbuster=
=20
would use the Houston outfit=01,s network systems to deliver online movies.=
 Lay=01,
s ambitions for Enron don=01,t stop there. He wants federal regulations rem=
oved=20
so the company can build power plants and power lines, which would put it i=
n=20
direct competition with utilities. In a conversation with Corporate Board=
=20
Member=01,s Ann Reilly Dowd, Lay discussed the energy crunch gripping the U=
nited=20
States and what government and boardrooms need to do about it. He also=20
describes how he assembled a board that enabled him to push Enron so far in=
to=20
the future. Excerpts:=20
On how real the energy crisis is: We have a genuine energy crisis in=20
California, which will see severe shortages or disruptions over the summer,=
=20
and a serious energy problem in most other places. Outside of California, t=
he=20
supply/demand balance is very tight, and maybe the infrastructure is being=
=20
pushed a little hard. But the energy situation certainly needs attention. I=
n=20
many ways, this country has underinvested in energy supply and infrastructu=
re=20
for at least 15 or 20 years. We need to start correcting for that.=20
On deregulation: What led to California=01,s energy crisis was not deregula=
tion=20
but a very flawed command-and-control regulatory system where most consumer=
s=20
don=01,t have any choice. Deregulation is not where you have a fixed price =
on=20
the retail side of the market and a floating competitive price on the=20
wholesale side. It=01,s also not where everybody has to buy most of their s=
upply=20
on the wholesale spot market. That was very, very dangerous from day one. W=
e=20
need to give consumers the benefits of real deregulation.=20
The solution for California=01,s problem has to be in California. Nationall=
y, we=20
need to get the rules right as quickly as possible. Part of the problem is=
=20
that there has been uncertainty in some states and regions as to what the=
=20
rules are. Uncertainty tends to lead to inaction. So we need to go ahead an=
d=20
finish up the deregulation process. Mainly, we need to remove barriers for=
=20
rebuilding the infrastructure, getting the right-of-way for new transmissio=
n=20
lines, and building power plants.=20
We need to distinguish between deregulating the retail and the wholesale=20
electricity market. On the wholesale side, the federal government, mainly t=
he=20
Federal Electricity Regulatory Commission, has a great deal of authority. O=
ne=20
of our recommendations has been that we need to get larger transmission gri=
ds=01*
regional, not just state grids. We need those to operate independently of t=
he=20
distribution and power generation functions. And we need those larger=20
regional grids to be truly open access and nondiscriminatory. We and many=
=20
other people are convinced that would increase the carrying capacity of the=
=20
system and help us in the interim as we expand and build out the system.=20
On price caps: I don=01,t hear anyone arguing that price caps would either=
=20
reduce demand or increase supply. And many people would argue just the=20
opposite, that they would increase demand and reduce supply.=20
Here=01,s one example. Enron was getting ready to build a peaking power pla=
nt in=20
California last October. We already had the site approved, and the turbines=
.=20
Then the state imposed price caps, and we had to cancel the project because=
=20
we couldn=01,t justify making the investment with the price caps. At least =
one=20
other company, CalPine, did the same thing. That means that this summer the=
re=20
will be about 1,000 megawatts less power available for the California marke=
t=20
than there would have been otherwise. That=01,s about 20% of the estimated =
peak=20
shortage that would have been available if there had not been price caps.=
=20
Second, price caps tend to allow political leaders to delay making the toug=
h=20
decisions necessary to solve the problem. Price caps may camouflage the=20
problem temporarily, but they don=01,t solve it. And to the extent that the=
=20
right decisions and action are not taken, the problem just gets worse.=20
On the public backlash against energy companies and their boards: Every tim=
e=20
we=01,ve had an energy problem, we get this same reaction. There is always =
a=20
discussion of conspiracy or collusion or anticompetitive behavior or excess=
=20
profits or whatever. Each time there are investigations.=20
In California, it seems the political leaders are trying to blame everybody=
=20
but themselves. They need to face up to the fact that the rules are wrong a=
nd=20
led to a drastically dangerous situation. Now we=01,ve got to solve it.=20
First of all, we=01,ve got to get the prices right, so consumers realize we=
=01,ve=20
got to use a lot less and suppliers realize we=01,ve got to produce a lot m=
ore.=20
We=01,ve got to streamline the process to site and build power plants. We=
=01,ve got=20
to do some very significant things from the point of view of reducing deman=
d.=20
And we need to open the market for competition. Then this problem will get=
=20
solved very quickly=01*a lot more quickly than trying to put on artificial =
price=20
caps. Everywhere we=01,ve tried price caps they have led to enormous econom=
ic=20
inefficiency and distortions.=20
The way we handle the criticism=01*and Enron=01,s board knows this=01*is by=
 being very=20
open and proactive, trying to work through solutions rather than pointing=
=20
fingers and conjuring up conspiracies. I and others on the Enron team have=
=20
been to California to meet with editorial boards and business and political=
=20
leaders. We try to educate various groups on what caused the problem and wh=
at=20
needs to be done to solve it.=20
On the need for all companies to have an energy policy: Even before this=20
recent increase, it=01,s been our experience that many companies have expos=
ed=20
themselves to a lot more price risk in their energy use than they realize. =
It=01,
s an area that quite often is not as actively managed as, for example, the=
=20
balance sheet. There is a lot of attention on interest rates and the=20
portfolio approach with some short-term, some medium-term, and some long-te=
rm=20
debt. We usually don=01,t see anywhere near the same sophistication applied=
 to=20
energy, even though in many cases, companies have a lot more risk exposure =
in=20
their energy purchases or procurement than they do in their debt portfolio.=
=20
On what boards should push for: I think the kind of questions board members=
=20
should be asking are: What is our policy on hedging fuel prices? Did we loc=
k=20
in any of our energy prices? If not, why not? What are we doing about the=
=20
future? Have we looked at all of our conversion and control equipment and a=
ll=20
of our policies and procedures? Are they truly =01&best in class?=018 Are w=
e=20
getting advice from companies that are truly world-class in this area?=20
On energy as a corporate asset: Enron has a major business outsourcing ener=
gy=20
for large industrial and commercial companies. We go in and evaluate the=20
energy activity, the equipment, the control systems, and the procurement=20
policies. Even before the recent run-up in prices, we had yet to find a=20
well-run business where we couldn=01,t reduce energy usage and costs by 5% =
to=20
15%.=20
Most companies, even fairly energy-intensive companies, are not necessarily=
=20
world-class at managing their energy activities. It=01,s not a core compete=
ncy.=20
It=01,s not where the best and the brightest want to spend much time. It=01=
,s also=20
not a place where many companies want to spend much capital. For all those=
=20
reasons, quite often the energy convergence and control equipment may not b=
e=20
the latest and most efficient, and companies may not be using best practice=
s.=20
We have looked at small companies, which may not be one-tenth or even=20
one-twentieth the size of Enron, that are exposing themselves to more=20
energy-related risk than Enron does worldwide. Usually they don=01,t know t=
hat=20
until they get a price spike. Then all of a sudden, it becomes a big factor=
=20
in why they aren=01,t meeting their earnings and cash-flow targets. In many=
=20
companies, energy is 10% to 20% of operating costs. If suddenly that rate=
=20
goes up 50% or 75% and a company is operating on thin margins, the profits=
=20
begin disappearing,=20
On how to build a world-class board: At Enron, I went outside and brought i=
n=20
a few key directors with a lot of creative ideas to stimulate the board=01,=
s=20
thinking. As we had turnover, I kept bringing in new people and,=20
increasingly, people from other countries, who brought specific talents tha=
t=20
we thought would be helpful. I also brought in a number of new executives=
=20
from different fields and backgrounds to help us jumpstart our effort to=20
build a significant business in the deregulating natural gas markets.=20
It=01,s the old chicken and egg proposition. The top board members want to =
be=20
with the top companies. So as you=01,re rebuilding the board, you=01,ve als=
o got to=20
rebuild the company. You have to make sure you are bringing in the manageme=
nt=20
talent you need and developing and executing the strategy to move the compa=
ny=20
in different directions. It all feeds on itself. As the talent base improve=
s=20
and the company=01,s success is recognized, it=01,s easier to bring in dire=
ctors.=20
The better directors you have, the more success you=01,re going to have in=
=20
business.=20
On transforming companies: Our biggest turning point was in the late 1980s,=
=20
when we decided to let our new deregulated business compete head-on with ou=
r=20
well-established and regulated pipeline business and, in the process, maybe=
=20
antagonize some of their customers and suppliers. Clearly we had divisions =
in=20
the company where some of the executive team thought that was smart, and so=
me=20
thought it was dumb. We all understood it was fairly risky. The main battle=
s=20
were internal within the management team. The board was supportive of takin=
g=20
that risk.=20
Today our regulated pipelines are still a good business, but certainly that=
=20
would never give us the kind of growth and opportunity we could obtain if w=
e=20
became truly =01&best in class=018 in operating in the deregulating energy =
markets.=20
On the biggest lesson learned: The most important thing is quality of talen=
t.=20
That=01,s true both on the management team and on the board. You have to ha=

Another rate increase -- The California Department of Water Resources, the
agency purchasing a bulk of the state's power needs in lieu of the three
investor-owned utilities, is expected to tell state regulators Friday that
they need to increase electricity rates by as much as 25%. This is because
there are insufficient funds in the current revenue stream to cover a $13.4
billion bond sale, three commissioners with the Public Utilities Commission
told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday. Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires

Judge rejects refunds -- California's claim for $8.9 billion in refunds for
excessive electricity charges ""cannot be substantiated,"" the federal
government's chief energy regulatory judge said yesterday, concluding his
two-week attempt to mediate the California energy dispute. Curtis L. Wagner

cannot be substantiated."" Three days after negotiations to reach an
agreement ended in failure, Curtis Wagner Jr., the chief administrative law
judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said any refund to
California would have to be much less than what state representatives
sought -- and would not come in cash. Christian Berthelsen in the San
Francisco Chronicle

Key pieces of power puzzle to be revealed -- Negotiations over two critical
pieces of California's energy crisis - Southern California Edison's
financial stability and the state's ability to pay for its energy
obligations - are coming to a head after months of wrangling. The Assembly

Edison rescue -- A week before its annual summer recess, the California
Legislature remains deeply divided over Gov. Gray Davis' plan to rescue
Southern California Edison from financial ruin--and a growing number of
lawmakers are proposing to let the state's second largest utility fall into
bankruptcy. Convinced that Davis' plan is political suicide, leading
Democrats in the Assembly and Senate on Thursday advanced slimmed-down
alternatives to save Edison. Miguel Bustillo and Nancy Vogel in the Los

Rate hike may hit businesses -- Businesses would be socked with a big rate
increase, while residential rates could hold steady, under the latest plan
to rescue Southern California Edison and resolve major energy matters the
state has been wrangling over since January. The proposal by Assembly
Democrats likely will draw fire from business interests. Rates easily could
triple for some companies. Meantime, the Davis administration was wrapping
up a plan likely to include further rate hikes to pay for $13.4 billion in
borrowing planned this fall. John Howard, Hanh Kim Quach and Kate Berry in

2 sides face off at EPA hearing on regulating energy plant emissions --
Power plants, refineries and factories need relief from federal clean air
laws if they are expected to respond to energy needs during a crisis,
industry officials told the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency yesterday.
California regulators and environmentalists, on the other hand, said the
federal policy that requires the best available pollution control equipment
to be installed when a new pollution source comes online is absolutely
necessary to protect air quality and health. Jane Kay in the San Francisco

to fill constituent mailboxes with a taxpayer-financed appeal urging
Californians to demand nearly $9 billion in energy price refunds from
""greedy out-of-state power generators."" Senate leader John Burton (D-San

State lawmakers lobby for refund on energy purchases -- Thwarted in their
quest for an $8.9 billion refund from wholesale power suppliers, state
officials began applying political pressure Thursday on federal regulators
who will set refund levels. A month after pressure from Congress prompted
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to accept price controls on
electricity, House Democrats from California urged FERC to support Gov. Gray

Governor hopes 'New FERC' will order refunds -- California Governor Gray
Davis Thursday said he hoped the newly-reconsituted Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission would order $8.9 billion in refunds for the state for
electricity overcharges, despite a FERC judge's report to the commission
that the refund amount was too high. ""I would like to believe the
commission, with two new commissioners, will be more sensitive to California
consumers and order all the refunds that are due,"" Davis said in a
statement. Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires

Duke Energy was one of the state's lowest-priced providers. An analysis by
The Charlotte Observer shows the state paid an average of $269 per
megawatt-hour for $3.5 billion of power during the first quarter, according
to documents from the state's Department of Water Resources. Duke was the
fourth-largest supplier to the agency, which buys about one-third of the

Calpine proposes power plant for Alviso -- Alviso, the long-neglected North
San Jose neighborhood abutting five landfills and a sewage treatment plant,
may become the site of two major power plants as well. Calpine has proposed
a 260-megawatt plant to power what would be the world's largest Internet
server farm. This may be good news to the people of Alviso, since the plant
would emit less smog than 89 diesel generators that would have been used
otherwise. Mike Zapler in the San Jose Mercury

Layoffs Possible As Enron Reduces Broadband Burn Rate
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Broadband Services executives said staff 
redeployments, including possible layoffs and an office closure were part of 
the plans to reduce losses at the telecommunications unit of Enron Corp. 
(ENE). 
The news came shortly after Enron President and Chief Executive Jeffrey 
Skilling told an investor call Thursday morning that Broadband Services lost 
$102 million in the second quarter of this year.
""We've got to get that burn rate down,"" Skilling said. ""And we will get the 
burn rate down in the next two weeks."" 
Broadband Services Senior Vice President Kelly Kimberly said Enron hadn't yet 
determined the exact number of the unit's approximately 1,000 employees to be 
redeployed. 
""We will be moving some commercial support people to corporate,"" Kimberly 
said. ""There will be redeployments. There may be some severances."" 
Commercial support employees are in departments like human resources and 
legal support offices. 
Also, the unit will close its Portland, Ore., office, but its back-up network 
operations center (NOC) there will remain in operation. 
Portland employees will be offered redeployment in Houston or other offices. 
Those who do not accept redeployment will be offered severance packages, 
Kimberly said. 
EBS's primary NOC is in northeast Houston, one of the areas hardest hit by 
Tropical Storm Allison. In spite of heavy rains and flooding last month, the 
Houston NOC continued functioning. However, Enron officials did activate the 
Portland NOC in case the Houston center could not remain open. 
This is the second redeployment of Broadband Services employees this year. 
The earlier redeployment was attributed by executives to the transition from 
building the EBS optical fiber network to operating the network. 
Revenues Victim Of Crash In Telecom Prices 
Skilling blamed the crash of telecommunications prices for the decline in 
revenues in the second quarter. 
""There is a meltdown out there,"" Skilling said during the conference call. 
Skilling said many potential counterparties among carriers can do only 
short-term deals in the bandwidth market because their creditworthiness is so 
weak. 
The company believes it will be one or two years before the bandwidth market 
gets to the point Enron had expected it to be this year, Skilling said. 
Enron is the primary market maker in the bandwidth arena. Skilling and 
Kimberly said the company will continue to develop the commoditized market. 
That leadership has left Enron feeling increasingly lonely in recent weeks, 
said an industry analyst. 
""Enron was trying to move this market fast,"" said William Bandt of Arthur 
Andersen L.L.P. ""They've been working to get out at the front of this market. 
Sometimes that's like being at the end of the high-dive board all by 
yourself."" 
Overall, Enron is in good financial shape because of its core energy 
industry. 
For the second quarter this year, Enron reported net income, excluding 
non-recurring items, of $404 million on revenues of $50.1 billion. In the 
second quarter of 2000, the company reported net income of $289 million on 
net revenues of $16.9 billion. 
The earnings per diluted share for the quarter is 45 cents compared with 34 
cents a year ago. Skilling said the company expects to achieve $1.80 in 
recurring earnings per diluted share this year. 
Broadband Services reported a loss of $102 million in the second quarter on 
$16 million in revenues before interest and taxes. In the same period of 
2000, the unit reported revenues of $151 million and a loss before interest 
and taxes of $8 million. 
EBS had 759 transactions in the second quarter 2001 compared with 23 in the 
second quarter of 2000. The company added 45 new customers in the second 
quarter, giving it a total of 165 customers, Skilling said. 
Carriers and network services providers made up more than 70% of Enron's 
broadband customers and accounted for about one-third of its transactions, he 
said. 
In the second quarter of this year, the company delivered 98,478 terabytes of 
data compared with 13,692 a year ago. 
For the year so far, EBS has delivered 141,878 terabytes of data compared 
with 19,697 in same period a year ago. 
Broadband Services has a goal of delivering 570,000 terabytes this year. 
Enron has signed a long-term contract with MSN to provide broadband services, 
Skilling said. The deal will allow MSN to provision and pay for bandwidth as 
it's needed. The company will give more information on that deal later,

US FERC To Meet June 18 On Western US Electricity Prices
  
06/11/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 


WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has 
scheduled a special meeting June 18 to address pending matters involving 
electricity markets in California and neighboring Western states. 


The commission's meeting notice provides no details, except to list for 
discussion four cases involving price mitigation in, and the structure of, 
volatile power markets in California and 10 other Western states.


The meeting comes as members of Congress are placing enormous political 
pressure on the commission to take more drastic action to contain runaway 
electricity prices in the region. 


Last week, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., joined 21 
Western-state congressional lawmakers to request an opportunity to appear 
before the commission to argue their case for cost-based price controls in 
the region's electricity markets. 


""At least twice, FERC has determined that the Western electricity market is 
'dysfunctional' and that prices are 'unjust and unreasonable' under the 
Federal Power Act. Despite these findings, and contrary to the law, the 
commission has failed to bring these rates to just and reasonable levels,"" 
the lawmakers said in a letter to FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.

271,"California Officials Investigate Electric 'Megawatt Laundering'
Steve Johnson , San Jose Mercury News, Calif.

( October 31, 2000 )



Oct. 30--While investigating this summer's stunning spike in electricity 
prices, state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenon:

On days when the weather is hot, batches of power generated in California are 
sold to other states. A little later in the day, similar amounts of power are 
sold back to California -- but at much higher prices.

The question is, is it the same power? If so, that could be ""megawatt 
laundering"" -- a multi-company conspiracy to evade California's wholesale 
price cap, which covers power generated in California but not power sold into 
California from elsewhere.

Worried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of 
dollars, several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering 
during a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearing a month ago in San 
Diego. And earlier this month, state Sen. Steve Peace, D-La Mesa -- who 
helped lead the push to deregulate electricity sales in California -- 
formally asked the commission to investigate the practice, which he termed 
""potentially illegal market coordination.""

But an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had 
concluded that generators had not abused the market. And others say concerns 
about megawatt laundering are exaggerated.

Among them is Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy 
Producers Association, a power-firm trade group, and chairman of the 
Independent System Operator, which oversees most of California's power grid.

While acknowledging that such laundering is possible, Smutny-Jones said there 
is no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespread.

""This is one of those things that's turning into an urban legend,"" he said. 
""I don't want to characterize this as a significant problem.""

Even some critics of the way power is purchased in California concede that 
most of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing 
more sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a 
good deal when they see one.

Nonetheless, they see evidence that at least some California-produced power 
is being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price. And they 
blame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed 
because the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of power.

The Independent System Operator ""invites this type of activity,"" said Frank 
Wolak, a Stanford economist who chairs the non-profit corporation's market 
surveillance committee, which has warned of the potential for megawatt 
laundering in at least two reports this year. ""The thing that makes all these 
problems go is the fact that the ISO has said, `We'll pay whatever it takes 
to keep the lights on,' and that's screwing consumers big time.""

In 1998, when the state's energy markets were deregulated, it was generally 
assumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make 
power less expensive. As a precaution, however, officials at the Independent 
System Operator instituted wholesale price caps, which they lowered twice 
this summer to help keep a lid on costs. On July 1 this year, they reduced 
the cap from $750 per megawatt per hour to $500, one megawatt being 
sufficient power for 1,000 homes. Then, on Aug. 7, they cut it to $250.

Unfortunately, things haven't worked out the way officials had hoped. 
Wholesale prices rose dramatically this year. And while a freeze on retail 
utility rates has temporarily shielded Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers 
from those soaring costs, home electricity prices have tripled in San Diego, 
where a similar freeze already has come off.

In the process, some generators learned that all it takes to get around the 
state's wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market 
works. One of the best ways to get top dollar, they learned, was to hold off 
selling their electricity until the Independent System Operator issues what 
is known as an out-of-market call for energy, which amounts to an emergency 
request for electricity.

From May through September this year, the overall price of power in the state 
averaged less than $125 per megawatt hour, according to authorities. But over 
the same period, power sold in response to out-of-market calls averaged more 
than $430.

During the summer, when energy use is at a maximum, California typically 
imports about one-fourth of the power it uses from other states. Since power 
generated by firms in other states isn't limited by California's price cap, 
those companies generally are in a better position than California firms to 
make a killing on out-of-market sales. But by cutting a deal with a 
collaborator in another state, energy specialists say, California generators 
also can profit handsomely -- despite the cap.

Here's how:

Say a California generator has 100 megawatts. Instead of selling it in 
California, where the firm can receive no more than $250 per megawatt hour 
under the current cap, it finds a utility, an electricity broker or a 
corporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state, such as 
Arizona. Then -- just before an expected heat wave in California, which is 
likely to result in an out-of-market call for power here -- it convinces the 
other firm to do a trade.

Under the deal, the California generator sends its 100 megawatts for one hour 
to the company in Arizona, where there is no price cap, and earns $300 or 
more per megawatt -- for a total of $300,000. In return, the Arizona firm 
ships its 100 megawatts for one hour here. Since that power isn't subject to 
California's cap, it earns perhaps $400 per megawatt -- for a total of 
$400,000.

Presumably, energy specialists say, the two firms then split the $100,000 
difference.

The potential profit from such deals is considerable. Generators in and out 
of California received more than $110 million from out-of-market sales this 
summer, according to the Independent System Operator. But determining if 
megawatt laundering is really happening, how often and who might be 
benefiting, is difficult.

One California investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt 
laundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of 
power was being sold to another state and then sold back into California 
minutes later. But other experts said the evidence has rarely been that 
clear. While hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any 
given day, they said, the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the 
same power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculation.

One big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been 
abused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these 
electricity transactions private.

""Entities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of 
this laundering don't necessarily have the documents"" to prove it, said Gary 
Stern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, one of 
the state's three main utilities. ""We can only speculate based on things 
we've heard from others about the practice....It's our hope that's one of the 
things that's being examined"" by the various federal and state agencies 
investigating this summer's extraordinary rise in California power prices.

Indeed, while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially 
limited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for 
out-of-state power, others argue that it's just as important to eliminate the 
secrecy surrounding electricity transactions.

""I'd like to see more information"" made public, said Jim Bushnell, a 
researcher at the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley, who 
specializes in analyzing the state's energy markets. ""There are a lot of 
rumors circulating around this,"" he said of megawatt laundering, ""and it 
would help clarify if this is a serious problem.""

chocolate and offset its bitterness. For this, Gaiser says the wine=20
""has to be really ripe and intense. High alcohol is almost necessary,=20
because it implies ripeness and richness.""=20

In this category, he suggests that ""port is probably best --=20

of  mandatory curtailment plans in D.91548; 
?
2. Establish clear procedures by which customers who are not operationally  
suited to participate in the OBMC but who face some level of increased  
environmental damage, health or safety risk upon sudden curtailment may 
qualify  under the ""Essential Use"" category of customers; and

284,"Here is what we know so far with the recent announcement of a deal between 
Socal and the State for the transmission lines:

? The deal may be enough to save Socal from bankruptcy.  This will depend on 
the payment terms as well as how soon Socal can receive a positive cash flow.
? We are not sure if the State can really do a deal without PG&E or a deal 
for whole grid.  It was thought that a transmission asset deal was not 
possible without PG&E.  This may still be the case; the state may still be 
making the deal contingent upon the purchasing of PG&E's assets.  A generator 
source reports that the state is intending to put pressure on the bankruptcy 
court to close the deal on PG&E's lines quickly.  However, bankruptcy courts 
usually do not operate in this manner.  In most cases the court would have to 
hold open proceedings, have competitive bids, etc.
? This purchase would need legislative approval, which is not guaranteed.  
Previously the plan was for the state to purchase SCE's and PG&E's assets at 
a premium so that they would not have to finance power purchases - the 
utilities would be able to buy power for themselves.  Now they would have to 
purchase SCE's lines, but still finance power purchases because of PG&E.  
Additionally, it is possible that Socal swapped the clause allowing then to 
raise rates in order to recoup past debt in favor for an additional book 
price.  If this any form of a utility bailout - it would probably no gain 
legislative approval.

	Calif GOP Lawmakers Ask PUC President To Resign 
	
	
	Updated: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 02:14 PM?ET 
	
	? 
	?
	
	
	
	
	LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the 
resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities 
Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator 
will ""play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis."" 
	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a 
letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican 
Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation. 
	
	
	?
	""With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of 
unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to 
ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public 
Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch,"" the letter said. 
	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment. 
	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in 
March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating 
utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies. 
Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of 
Planning and Research. 
	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the 
electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison 
International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp. 
(PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, 
msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts 
for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term 
contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators. 
	Lynch's failure to ""ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency 
order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state 
budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher,"" the letter said. ""This 
hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of 
dollars during the next 20 years."" 
	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the 
spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the 
general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the 
state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion. 
	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate 
Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves 
out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the 
agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the 
cash-strapped utilities. 
	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can 
receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue 
bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been 
released. 
	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term 
supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the 
commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with 
generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced. 
	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly 
forcing the utilities into bankruptcy. 
	""We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in 
solving the energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead,"" the letter said. 
""With Wall Street nervous about repayment of the $10 billion in revenue bonds 
needed to cover the state's energy purchases, the CPUC has been unable to 
perform an adequate assessment of the investor-owned utilities' financial 
situation.""

Proposal to Alleviate California=01,s Electricity Shortage
Through Incentives to Reduce Demand

Objective
=06=15 Provide consumers with financial incentives to reduce demand in=20
anticipation of Summer 2001 electricity demand

Proposal
=06=15 The California PUC should require the utilities to immediately condu=
ct=20
on-line auctions for demand reductions totaling at least 2,000 MWs
=06=15 Alternatively, DWR could run the auction and implement the buy-down=
=20
program.  However, if it is determined that DWR requires additional authori=
ty=20
to execute the auction, the State should avoid any further delays and direc=
t=20
the CPUC to order the utilities to implement the buy-down program immediate=
ly.

The Auction Process (assuming the utilities implement the program)
=06=15 Businesses and large consumers willing to commit to sustained reduct=
ions=20
through November 1, 2001 would submit bids indicating the price they would =
be=20
willing to receive for a given quantity of permanent reduction=20
=06=15 If the =01&supply=018 of available reductions offered in the auction=

2,000 MWs, the utility should accept them, or explain to the Commission why=
=20
they chose not to accept them=20
=06=15 Businesses should be permitted to include in their bids the continue=
d=20
payment of wages to compensate employees for hours of employment foregone d=
ue=20
to demand reductions

A Single Price Approach
=06=15 A single price approach to a demand buy down program has two key=20
disadvantages:
=06=15 First, customers who would be willing to reduce demand for a lesser =
price=20
will be overpaid, much in the same way the single price auction in the PC=
=20
overpaid lower cost generators.  The state would overpay for reduced demand=
=20
under the single price approach.
=06=15 Second, the single price may not attract sufficient demand reduction=
s.
=06=15 Further, the single price approach does not provide greater certaint=
y=20
regarding the cost of demand reductions.  By conducting an auction the stat=
e=20
will be able to observe all bids and pay on an as bid basis, starting with=
=20
the lowest bids necessary to provide the required demand reductions up to t=
he=20
cost the state is willing to pay.
=06=15 A single price approach, however, could work if targeted at customer=
s who=20
would not participate in an auction, i.e. residential customers.  A well=20
publicized program of rebates to residential customers who use less than la=
st=20
year would further reduce demand in the state.  Thus the auction and the=20
single price could be structured in a complimentary fashion.
=06=15 The costs of the incentive program should be paid for by all consume=
rs,=20
since all consumers will benefit from the decreased risk of service=20
interruptions caused by the demand reductions
=06=15 If DWR implements the program, DWR=01, would recover its costs throu=
gh rates,=20
similar to the cost recovery mechanism used to recover power purchase costs=
.
=06=15 If the utilities implement the program, the California PUC would inc=
lude=20
program costs in rates collected from customers
=06=15 The auction should be conducted online which will increase transpare=
ncy and=20
reduce the time required to complete the process

Hazards to Avoid
=06=15 Avoid allowing lengthy utility and/or PUC review to delay implementa=
tion of=20
the reductions
_ Any unnecessary delay increases the chance that California will fail to=
=20
achieve the reductions needed to help avoid severe shortages in Summer 2001
_ There are numerous firms offering moderately-priced on-line auction=20
services that can quickly provide auction services to the utility
_ The utility should immediately contract for on-line services and present=
=20
the contract to the California PUC for prompt approval
_ The utilities should also include in their submittal to the PUC a simple,=
=20
streamlined set of pre-qualification criteria that would apply to bidders
_ The pre-qualification criteria should be designed with the goal of making=

Faced with the price spikes in California, the new administration led by 
Governor Davis has been pretty hostile toward deregulation.  Perhaps the 
administration's (and its California PUC) hostility represents a 
""placeholder"" until the administration comes up with it's own plan to ""fix"" 
the mess that California refers to as a ""market.""  As such, there hasn't been 
much coming out of the California PUC other than rhetoric regarding the fact 
that Republicans, not Democratics, restructured California's market and the 
desire to go backwards to good 'ol cost-of-service, command-and-control 
regulation.  However, the ISO and the PX have issued interesting reports,

314,"Late last evening the Assembly committee passed its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78).
Despite attempts by consumer groups to weaken and/or eliminate the DA provisions in the bill, the bill passed with the DA provisions intact.
The DA provisions in the bill that passed out of the committee are essentially the same as those discussed previously (see previous note attached).
The Assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the Appropriations committee today or tomorrow--the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee.
When and if the bill makes it out of the Appropriations committee, the Assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full Assembly.
If it makes it out of the full Assembly, it will then go to the Senate for approval, where the leader of the Senate, John Burton, continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the Senate are slim.
On the PUC front, efforts are underway to stop the PUC from passing the proposal it issued last week.  
The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1.
In conversations with the Governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed, they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the PUC proposal and are working to resolve it.

323,"Davis devises new borrowing plan 
His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. 
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. 
The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. 
With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. 
""That is one scenario,"" Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. ""There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced."" 
Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. 
Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. 
The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. 
The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. 
Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. 
The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. 
The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. 
The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. 
Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. 
""I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great,"" Lynch said. ""But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things."" 
The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. 
If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.

341,"I never heard back from you so I thought it best to drop a note. 

My interest in having a discussion with you are two fold:

1) I am currently making the resizing and structuring decisions for the 
Argentine business. There exist a strong bias towards consolidation of 
resources and headcount reduction. This is a decision of necessity and 
immediacy which does not afford everyone the opportunity to fully understand 
the markets that are being affected. This strategy clearly makes sense but I 
would like to make sure we avoid destroying value as this massive wave hits 
the beach.  

I need to better understand the balance between the aggregation of 
intellectual capital in Sao Paulo and the ability to maintain a credible 
commercial presence in an emerging market such as Argentina. If the reality 
is to shut down Argentina for the sake of emphasizing focus on Brazil fine. 
Then we should try to package and sell what we have already built to maximize 
value. We probably have gone too far to achieve this at this point. 

But I believe what we are trying to achieve is a liquid Argentina focus from 
Brazil. The risk here is we take this structure too far the other direction 
(IE ""The Wave""). Resizing to match commercial opportunity makes good sense 
but when we take it too far we risk giving the market the perception we are 
not serious which will immediately diminish our credibility and our ability 
to participate, transact and advance as a participant in the Argentine 
market. This corresponding destroys value in what we have achieved to date 
and what we are trying to achieve currently.

I just need to get this model clear in my mind as I finalize the Argentina 
structure and I have not had a chance to hear your thoughts directly. 

2) Joe has also asked me to become part of the Sao Paulo effort once I finish 
getting Argentina straightened out. To give him an answer I would be 
interested in your confidential opinion on the best utilization of my skills 
and ability in terms of Enron in either Latin America, North America or 
Europe.  Joe indicated you were the right person to discuss this with. I have 
moved my family a few too many times in the past 24 months. I can not afford 
to keep bouncing them around so I will need to make sure this is the best 
decision at this time for Enron and myself. We were in Sao Paulo last year 
and the city is fine but the questions will be for how long?, accomplishing 
what with my career? and will the position maximize my value. 

Let me know if you have an extra minute.

354,"George, it is probably worth  speaking to them about the US assets - probably 
the smaller Virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great 
brownfield sites. I'm not sure we would have an interest in UK coal fired 
assets. I would speak to Sherriff on that one. However, I would caution that 
real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on 
Enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents.  

For ComEd and Homer City, Mission has already paid up for these assets based 
on gas being on the margin.  Now that was before a lot of the run up so it 
may be worthwhile; however, I think it may be difficult to arb these guys.  
As well, I think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them - I'm not 
sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a 
Wall Street point of view.  

We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia 
assets. Are they in QF, if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran's 
point of view..

Dave, given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger 
part of the load curve, coal assets or coal QF's may be great assets for us 
from a restructuring and power asset (expansion/brownfield) point of view.  
Have we looked at this?  Are there many in the market?

373,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

scheduled for Wednesday 2/16 to Tuesday 2/22 in room 3013. Lunch will be 
provided. I apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future. 
I was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first 
meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we 
know are needed in our work hours. 

Here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting:

Schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other 
contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss 
at the next meeting.

Each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for 
their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting

Bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow 
up with HR on schedules being used at Enron



The following is what I heard at the first meeting:

Our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that 
would more or less guarantee (other than maybe an occasional call) you have 
the weekend off.  Cross-training seemed to be the key here. Some desks seemed 
to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels. 
Cross-training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a ""just do it"" 
attitude. 

There doesn't have to be an across the board solution for Logistics. However 
all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will 
be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk 
changes.

Late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders 
willingness to do deals at any time. As we get a better handle on what other 
companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address 
this. Everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid-week etc. and 
really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job.

There were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some 
type of rotating group. Mixed feelings about whether the group would be open 
to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule. 


Feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification. I'm 
looking forward to our next meeting - Bob

507,"There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the 
close of our meeting today.  I'll try to restate them, and add my initial 
thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.  

Q 1. Can TW use ""negotiated rate"" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?  

A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were 
certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction 
is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an 
alternative to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements 
for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are 
executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it 
will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert. 
app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given 
the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to 
sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the 
capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a 
combination of both.  

Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a ""cafeteria style"" menu of options 
(to steal Jeff's term), like the following:
 1.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or 
whatever number we decide on)
 2.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges
 3.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah
 4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly 
this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and 
fuel retainage percentages)

A.  I think the answer here is ""yes.""  Whatever options we come up with for 
1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve 
Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated 
rate options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach 
could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking 
our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a 
7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would be 
a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can tell a 
customer ""no"" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for 
the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out options 
of our choosing and then enforce a ""no substitutions"" policy (this is 
sticking with the ""cafeteria"" theme) but we need to be sure.  

Q.3.  If we can use the ""cafeteria options"" approach, how much flexibility do 
we have in structuring the options?  

A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose 
to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want to 
be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at 
$.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have 
discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we 
can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better 
deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we 
deliberately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by 
offering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and 
$.35 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to 
obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.            

Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???

A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it 
the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, 
Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d 
of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 
mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who want 
option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That 
really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand 
first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else?  
Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be 
deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone may 
be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the 
recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the 
neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective 
nondiscriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh. 

Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answered 
already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are 
easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your 
convenience to discuss.  We've gotta move quick so the marketers can get out 
and sell this stuff.  DF

the settlement with the Navajos--sounds to me like you and Mr Soldano did 
some fine work! 

 We still haven't pulled the trigger on arbitration of the OneOk imbalance 
(the measurement issue) but we are getting closer.  Before we do, I wanted to 
get your thoughts on our ""two prong"" strategy once again.  You will recall 
that we intend to initiate the arbitration and simultaneously file a dec 
action in Texas state court.  That approach is described briefly in the 
attached pleading.  The pleading is pretty brief and terse--both Grant Harvey 
at Gibbs and Bruns and Britt wanted to keep the dec action as straightforward 
as possible.  I'll ask my secretary to block off an hour sometime this 
afternoon or early next week if your schedule permits.  I look forward to 
talking with you!  Thanks.  DF

512,"Either I didn't fully understand the December Texas Eastern order or else 
FERC has just put a new and unhelpful spin on it.  The Thursday rehearing 
order dramatically changes how the ""shipper must have title"" rule applies to 
acquisitions of upstream capacity.   I thought the Dec. order pretty clearly 
allowed a pipe to acquire upstream capacity and then resell that capacity 
under the acquiring pipeline's rate schedules.  FERC specifically held that  
the ""shipper must have title"" policy won't be applied if the acquiring pipe 
treats the acquired capacity ""as though it were part of its own system"".  (p. 
61,886)  The Dec. order even cited TW's acquisition of park n ride capacity 
from PG&E as an example of the type of transaction that (I thought) could be 
done without advance Commission approval.   Now, FERC explains that it did 
not intend a ""blanket waiver"" of the shipper must have title policy.   Pipes 
can still acquire upstream capacity without advance FERC permission, but only 
if the acquiring pipe is going to use the acquired capacity for operational 
needs or to resell under the selling pipe's release mechanism.  If the 
acquiring pipe wants to use the acquired capacity to support sales of service 
under the acquiring pipe's rate schedules, a specific waiver of the ""must 
have title"" policy is required (see FN 20 and text).   We are right back to 
where we started.  I guess the orders signal that FERC is  much more likely 
to grant waivers of the ""must have title"" policy than in the past, but I 
don't think we are good to go to acquire upstream storage, for example, and 
resell it as FDD or IDD until we get permission first.  

Shelley--let me know if you hear any expressions of outrage from other 
pipes.  This might be worth chasing on rehearing since it is such a clear 
about face by FERC.

539,"Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to  Columbia Energy Services 
for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.  I downloaded this directly from Michcon's 
system  and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in 
the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.  It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and 
what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the 
difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.   

We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates 
of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make 
sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to 
CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:

   Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference
3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177)

3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0


I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go 
back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is 
imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to 
the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the 
gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is 
out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the 
scheduler would help tremendously.  

Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at 
acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that 
a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On 
the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to 
CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day 
with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required 
Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our 
suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to 
look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be 
delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points 
for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT 
customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other 
non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have 
made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we 
could.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

I believe Shemin has a much better idea though.  BUT, I think its important to note that those producer agreements are Enfolio contracts.

569,"Chris,

A couple of years ago the East and the Central Desks decided that Empire 
State Pipeline in NY would
be changed from an ""East Desk pipeline"" to a ""Central Desk pipeline"" in our 
scheduling and accounting
systems.  The reason for that decision was to fix the significant OA 
variances both desks were experiencing
by the Sithe book liquidations, and to better control and manage all the 
subtle little issues under the gas
sales agreement.  Since the only transaction that was being done on Empire 
was the Sithe deal, this 
approach has worked great and the OA and contract problems have been 
corrected. 

Over the last month or so, Sithe pointed out to us that some days CNG North 
Point gas prices were high 
enough so that Chippawa gas could be shipped over to CNG Lysander and still 
make a margin.  I talked 
to Geoff Storey about it and told him to keep that trade in mind.  At the 
time I assumed that Sithe's IT 
contract would be used to ship the volumes from Chippawa to one of the new 
interconnects with NFGS 
at Pendleton or CNG at Lysander and that we would just schedule it on the 
Central Desk and report the 
transactions under our monthly revenue sharing transactions with Sithe.

If ENA begins shipping gas on Empire under our own agreement, there are a 
couple things that I am very
concerned about:

 o   ENA has a contractual obligation to optimize Sithe's transportation 
assets & to split
       the incremental revenues with Sithe,
 o   Empire desperately wants to Sithe's new 750 MW plant to be served 
through Empire
       and if we start doing alot of IT business on Empire the word will 
probably get back to Sithe,
 o   I hope that Empire Pipeline continues to be a ""Central Desk pipeline"" in 
our systems.  We can
       not go back to that mess we had before when the Sithe deal was split 
between two desks.

I will be back in the office on Tuesday, maybe we can get everybody together 
an make sure that we can
come up with a plan that works for everybody.

Thanks,

It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.  All four 
of us had a great time.  It was so good to see all of you and especially 
great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.  I really regret 
that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and 
by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).  But even given that, I feel 
as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's 
like we have always spent alot of time together.  I guess that's why they 
call it family.  So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look 
forward to our next get together, wherever and whenever it may be.

<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

Guarded optimism about economic prospects helped rally stocks to new
highs for October, and the US Dollar re-asserted its strength during
a week that saw most Commodities lacking firm directions.  Lumber
was a rare exception, shooting higher on the basis of increased cash
market activity.  Wheat also ended with a solid advance tied to
exports.  Corn and Soybeans, however, continued to be pressured by
favorable weather conditions, while there was little movement in
Energies, although Natural Gas was firm.  Cotton slumped to 29-year
lows, Coffee looked uncertain, and Hogs lost ground.  Short-covering
on Friday ahead of the weekend produced nice bounces for Gold and
Copper.

Will you please create the following products for me when you get the 
chance?  I would like to have GD/D HHUB vs EP San Juan,  GD/D HHUB vs. EP 
Permian, GD/D HHUB vs. Malin, and  GD/D HHUB vs. Kern/Opal.  These will look 
like the GD/D HHUB vs. SCal that we currently have in EOL.

Also, Can I please create three Gas Daily basis products. GD/D BAJA spread - 
This spread will simply be the GD/D SCAL vs. PG&E Citygate. 
The GD/D Redwood off-system spread - GD/D Malin vs. SCal.  The GD/D Redwood

618,"Rob, Cyndi,

Apologies for the delay in getting back to you on this subject. 


The European Issues

The one year retention period proposed by Houston does cause Europe a problem 
for two reasons:

1. The UK custom is to retain documentation for the limitation period of 7 
years, ie just over the limitation period. Not to do this could disadvantage 
Enron in litigation in the UK ( and we have historically had some major 
litigation: CATS, J Block and ETOL). To destroy documents within this period 
could be negatively construed in the English Courts. We asked Slaughter and 
May to write us a brief paper on this subject which I attach. This bears out 
our views. 

2. Secondly the Securities and Futures Authority generally stipulates a three 
year retention period for records of regulated business. The definition of 
such records includes any written communication between firm and customer 
with respect to regulated business.


A Proposed European Email Retention Policy

An email retention policy which meets all these requirements would be as 
follows: 

Inbox: Email messages in an employee's inbox will be deleted 30 days after 
receipt (No change from proposed policy)
Sent: Email messages in an employee's sent file will be deleted 30 days after 
receipt (No change from proposed policy but IT to confirm this does not also 
delete sent messages saved in folders )
Trash: Email messages in an employee's trash file will be deleted 15 days 
after being place in the employee's trash file (No change from proposed 
policy)
Folders: Email messages in an employee's folders will be moved to archives 
365 days after being placed in the folder. (Instead of being deleted)
Archives: Email messages in archives will be retained for 6 years after being 
archived, such that the total retention period for emails, from creation to 
deletion is 7 years (all new.) 

We would propose to introduce an identical policy for paper files. We would 
also propose not to take account longer limitation periods which prevail in 
other European countries on the basis that the additional exposure after a 7 
year period in countries in which Enron Europe is not particularly active, is 
small.


The Judgement Call

I think in Europe we have no choice but to introduce a three year retention 
period to comply with the SFA rules. I also think that this probably needs to 
apply generally rather than attempting to ring fence emails concerning 
regulated business. Whether we then decide to retain for the additional 4 
years seems to me to depend upon:

whether we think this additional period introduces an unacceptable risk for 
Enron as a whole when weighed against the probable benefits in Europe;
the cost of storage during the additional period is likely to be material.

My personal view of the first point is that the risk for Enron as a whole is 
probably small compared with the potential benefits for Enron Europe. The 
cost of a large disclosure exercise in English litigation can be huge, but we 
would only undertake this, or be forced to undertake this, if sufficient 
value were at stake. Either way, we would probably be advantaged by having a 
comprehensive documentary record of events, which is what our opponent in the 
litigation process would in all likelihood have.

I need to check that senior management here agrees with this analysis and 
will do so immediately. The second point I will check with our IT people.

We probably then need to discuss this.

=09=09=09In our previous  Littler E-Lert,  ""Emerging Trends: Less Pretrial =
Dismissals=20
of Employment Suits  and More Trials,"" we discussed the likelihood that=20
federal  courts will be more inclined to let juries decide employment =20
discrimination cases. Based on a recent Texas Supreme Court  case, Quantum=
=20
Chemical Corp. v. Toennies, Texas  employers should anticipate the same tre=
nd=20
in employment cases  arising under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act=
=20
(TCHRA)  in Texas state courts.=20
=09=09=09
=09=09=09Ralf Toennies worked  for Quantum Chemical as an engineer. A few m=
onths after=20
he  began to report to a new supervisor, his performance reviews  changed=
=20
from being satisfactory to ""below expectations."" After  Quantum fired=20
Toennies for poor performance, Toennies sued  Quantum, alleging that he was=
=20
the victim of age  discrimination. At trial (where the jury found no =20
discrimination), Toennies did not introduce any direct  evidence of age=20
discrimination. Instead, he attempted to prove  discrimination by=20
establishing that the employer=01,s reason for  his termination - poor=20
performance - was false or a pretext  for discrimination. Some of the=20
co-workers called to testify  at trial stated that Toennies was ""diligent""=
=20
and ""very  competent."" The Texas Supreme Court held that this testimony  an=
d=20
his prior satisfactory performance appraisals, which  contradicted the=20
employer=01,s explanation that Toennies was a  poor performer, was enough t=
o=20
""permit the trier of fact to  find that the employer was actually motivated=
=20
by  discrimination."" The Court remanded the case for  another trial with a=
=20
new set of jury instructions to assess  whether the employer's decision was=
=20
motivated by Toennies'  age.
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09In its analysis of  the case, the Court held that the question the=
 jury=20
should  answer is whether the plaintiff=01,s protected status - age,  race,=
 sex,=20
etc. - ""was a motivating factor"" for the employment  decision. The=20
plaintiff-employee does not have to prove that  his or her protected status=
=20
was the ""sole"" factor or the  ""determining"" factor in the decision; instead=
,=20
if the jury  determines that the protected status ""was a motivating  factor=
,""=20
then the jury may decide that the plaintiff was the  victim of illegal=20
discrimination.=20
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09While this merely may  seem to be only a difference in verbiage, t=
he shift=20
is  significant. The ""motivating factor"" standard is much  different than=
=20
proving that ""but for"" the protected status,  the employer would not have=
=20
fired the employee. The practical  effect of the Court's decision is to=20
increase the burden on  the employer to show that it would have made the=20
adverse  employment decision regardless of the employee's protected  status=
.=20
This decision will make summary judgment in an  employment case even more=
=20
difficult to obtain in state court.  Even if a supervisor does not have an=
=20
illegal motive for the  termination, if there is a scintilla of evidence th=
at=20
casts  doubt on the reason why the employee was terminated, the  employer=
=01,s=20
fate may be in the hands of the jury.=20
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09Accordingly,  before making a termination or other adverse employm=
ent =20
decision, we recommend  that employers?perform an exit interview with two=
=20
persons  (other than the supervisor) present to ascertain if the  employee=
=20
has any discrimination concerns. Consider having the  employee sign an=20
acknowledgment documenting the topics  discussed in the exit interview. If=
=20
the employee alleges  disparate treatment, the termination should be put on=
 =20
administrative hold until the issues have been investigated.  The employee=
=20
need not be reinstated, but the termination  should not be made final until=
=20
the investigation is completed.  Review termination decisions with counsel,=
=20
if necessary, to  assess the litigation risks.? Finally, implement =20
procedures to prevent hasty, unauthorized termination  decisions.
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09
=09=09=09In addition to  preventive measures, employers should also examine=
 all =20
pleadings, affirmative defenses, and jury charges in pending  TCHRA cases t=
o=20
be certain that it has raised all defensive  theories. For example, an=20
employer may reduce damages if the  employer can establish that it would ha=
ve=20
made the same  adverse employment decision regardless of the employee's =20
protected status. Each lawsuit should be reviewed on  case-by-case basis to=
=20
determine whether to raise that defense. =20

Problems Mount for Sierra Pacific Resources,
Acquisition of Portland General Appears Uncertain

by Will McNamara 
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

The probability appears to be getting smaller that Sierra Pacific Resources 
(NYSE: SRP) will complete its $3.1 billion acquisition of Portland General 
Electric (NYSE: PGB) from Enron (NYSE: ENE). Enron disclosed in an 8K filing 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Feb. 27 that the sale of 
Portland General had been delayed because of ""recent events"" in California 
and Nevada that affected Sierra Pacific. Walt Higgins, chair and CEO of 
Sierra Pacific Resources, told Wall Street analysts that the acquisition 
agreement will terminate if it has not closed by May 1. 

Analysis: Yesterday I wrote about the apparent collapse of the merger between 
Consolidated Edison and Northeast Utilities (NU). Now, another high-profile 
merger appears to be unraveling. As with the Con Edison / NU deal, the 
problem facing Sierra Pacific Resources' pending purchase of Portland General 
from Enron is based in economics. Namely, it appears that Sierra Pacific 
Resources' recent financial problems have cast doubt on the company's ability 
to complete its purchase of Portland General. This is not a good development 
for Sierra Pacific Resources, as the financial and legal implications of this 
potentially dead acquisition could exacerbate the company's current financial 
problems.  

First, let me provide some background on this deal. The origin of Sierra 
Pacific Resources' attempt to acquire Portland General date back to November 
1999. Enron had purchased the company in 1997 as a strategic move to 
facilitate its intent to play a major role in the retail markets of 
California and the Pacific Northwest. At the time, Enron saw itself as a 
prototype for the future of the energy industry, adding transmission and 
distribution capabilities as well as more diversified fuel resources to its 
already successful wholesale marketing core. Stymied by the slow start of 
competition in California and Oregon, Enron underwent a transformation in its 
corporate philosophy. Under the growing direction of Jeffrey Skilling, Enron 
no longer believed that it needed to own hard assets to retain its place in 
the top tier of energy companies. That philosophy has served Enron well, as 
its success in nearly all of its business sectors has been well documented. 

Yet, Enron's transformation opened the door for Sierra Pacific Resources, a 
relatively small and regionally based holding company, to move in for a 
purchase of Portland General. Owning Portland General made more sense for 
Sierra Pacific Resources than it did for Enron. Portland General, which 
provides electric service to over 700,000 customers in the Portland-Salem 
area, was viewed as a good acquisition target as it would help Sierra Pacific 
Resources to gain scale and a foothold in two fast-growing states (Nevada and 
Oregon). Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to pay Enron $2.1 billion for 
Portland General, which included $2.02 billion in cash and assumption of 
Enron's $80 million merger payment obligation. In addition, Sierra Pacific 
Resources agreed to assume $1 billion in Portland General debt and preferred 
stock, taking the total value of the purchase to $3.1 billion. Portland 
General appeared happy with the scheduled sale from Enron, acknowledging that 
its own core business ""delivering safe and reliable power with a customer 
service focus"" was more in line with Sierra Pacific Resources.  

However, a number of economic factors on Sierra Pacific Resources' side of 
the table seem to be thwarting this acquisition. As I discussed in the Feb. 
22 IssueAlert (available at www.consultrci.com), Sierra Pacific Resources 
reported a significant fourth-quarter loss ($18.2 million) as a result of 
soaring costs of power in the western United States. The company incurred 
losses as a direct result of ""the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased 
power in the volatile wholesale market."" As a result, Sierra Pacific 
Resources filed with state regulators for an emergency rate increase. 
""Without some rate relief, the cost of fuel and power is close to crippling 
our ability to serve the needs of our customers,"" said Mark Ruelle, the 
company's chief financial officer. The company attributed the latest 
quarter's loss to nearly $258 million of unanticipated fuel and purchased 
power costs. 

Specifically, Sierra Pacific Resources reported a 4Q 2000 loss of $18.2 
million, or 23 cents a share. This compared with a profit of $26.8 million, 
or 39 cents a share, excluding a $56 million deferred energy write-off a year 
ago. Including the write-off, the company reported a loss of $29.2 million, 
or 42 cents a share, in 4Q 1999. For year-end 2000, the company reported a 
net loss of $39.8 million or 51 cents per share, a 177-percent drop from 
1999. 

In addition, the company's stock has fallen steadily over the last few weeks 
(at one point, dropping 11.8 percent to $10.80 on the New York Stock Exchange 
Feb. 7). At the close of trading on March 7, shares of Sierra Pacific 
Resources were priced at $13.80, which is still down from its 52-week high of 
$19.43 and book value of $17.82. The drop in stock price could make it 
difficult for Sierra Pacific Resources to secure the financing necessary to 
complete the purchase of Portland General. 

Meanwhile, Sierra Pacific Resources' available cash flow could be impacted by 
possible restrictions placed on the sale of its power plants. The Public 
Utility Commission of Nevada (PUCN) mandated divestiture as a condition of 
the 1999 merger between Nevada Power Co. and Sierra Pacific Power Co, which 
created the holding company Sierra Pacific Resources. Toward that end, the 
holding company and its wholly owned utility subsidiaries commenced a public 
auction of approximately 2,900 MW of power generation facilities. Of Sierra 
Pacific Resources' nine power plants, which are mostly fired by natural gas 
and coal, seven have been entered into sales agreements to companies such as 
Dynegy and NRG and will be sold upon final regulatory approval.   

However, over the last few weeks, there has been growing concern that Nevada 
regulators would not approve pending sales or authorize the sale of 
additional power plants by Sierra Pacific Resources, thus preventing the 
company from using the proceeds to pay for the acquisition of Portland 
General. Perhaps out of fears about depleting the Nevada's power supply, the 
Attorney General's Bureau of Consumer Protection, the Southern Nevada Water 
Authority and the AFL-CIO have urged that the sale of the plants be delayed 
or canceled. Further, Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn has called on the PUCN to 
reconsider the 1999 order that required Sierra Pacific Resources to sell the 
plants owned by its two utilities, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power. Any 
available cash that Sierra Pacific Resources was planning to use from the 
power plant sales to support its acquisition of Portland General may not 
materialize if the sales agreements are delayed or terminated. 

Ironically, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power Co. just received approval 
from the PUCN to secure $1.4 billion in bank loans, bond financing and 
preferred securities. However, due to agreements that the utilities 
previously made, none of the borrowed money may be used, directly or 
indirectly, to financially support its parent's acquisition of Portland 
General.  

Thus, Sierra Pacific Resources seems to be between a rock and a hard place 
regarding this purchase, which it apparently still wants to complete. It 
would appear that Sierra Pacific Resources will have difficulty financing the 
purchase of Portland General due to the combination of its significant 
financial losses, plunging stock prices and possible restrictions against the 
sale of its power plants. Presumably, these are the ""recent events"" to which 
Enron referred in its SEC filing.  

It is fairly clear that Enron no longer wishes to own Portland General and 
believes that the company does not fit into its strategy for continuing 
growth. What remains in question, however, is what will happen if Sierra 
Pacific Resources' pending acquisition is not completed by the May 1 
deadline, thus terminating the sales agreement. The problems associated with 
the Con Edison / NU merger are leading to litigation. One can't help but 
think that lawsuits would be inevitable in the Enron / Portland General / 
Sierra Pacific Resources case as well, as Enron presumably would seek to be 
compensated in some way for the $3.1 billion that the deal includes.  

Further complicating matters for Sierra Pacific Resources is a growing 
movement to municipalize the electric markets in Las Vegas and Henderson, 
Nev. On Jan. 11, the Southern Nevada Water Authority suggested that the 
agency could become a public power authority. Pat Mulroy, general manager of 
the water authority, recommended that the agency buy power on wholesale 
markets and possibly generate electricity from some of its own power plants 
to serve cities in the area. Efforts to municipalize electric systems in the 
southern half of the state could potentially gain momentum if Sierra Pacific 
Resources' financial problems worsen.

Report Says Banks, Brokerages Need to Advance into Investment

For the survival of the domestic financial industry in global competition,
banks and securities companies need to be pushed to advance into investment
banking, the Korea Securities Research Institute asserted yesterday.

In a seminar on stock market development, the institute presented a paper
calling for expanded participation in investment banking by domestic
financial institutions.

""The global financial industry is heading for a single market as evidenced
by the growing synchronization of financial markets around the world,"" the
report said. ""Since the global financial industry is increasingly reshaped
by mergers and acquisitions and business crossovers, domestic financial
institutions should pursue investment banking."" To promote investment
banking in Korea, the institute said measures should be taken to build
reliable databases of economic and financial statistics, foster experts,
encourage brokerages to develop their underwriting capabilities, expand the
concept of securities and encourage business crossovers among financial
institutions.

As promising areas of investment banking, the institute cited asset
management, mergers and acquisitions, asset assessment, trading of
over-the-counter products and derivatives, and securities designing.

According to the institute, the global financial market is experiencing a
transition from direct funding through banks to direct funding through stock
exchanges. This sea change is demolishing the distinction between banks and
securities firms.

Furthermore, it said, capital liberalization in a growing number of
countries is accelerating the integration of national capital markets into a
single global market.

""The pursuit of large size and business crossovers will intensify in the
future. At the same time, progress in financial engineering and information
technology will give rise to more complicated financial products, which will
further liven up indirect investment instruments,"" it said.

The institute said foreign financial institutions' inroads into the domestic
market would increase, helping domestic institutions improve their business
practices and financial technology.


Capital Markets Report, 9/6/00
OCC Official: Still Hopeful For Derivatives Reform
By Jonathan Nicholson

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- A top banking watchdog on Wednesday held out hope
that laws dealing with derivatives transactions and bankruptcies may yet be
updated this year.

""If nothing happened, it would not be disastrous. There's not a lot of time
left on the calendar,"" said Mike Brosnan, deputy comptroller for risk
evaluation for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

""It would certainly be a better world if the bankruptcy and insolvency
provisions were finalized. There's a chance that could happen,"" he said.

Brosnan spoke to reporters during the agency's quarterly briefing on bank
derivatives trading revenues. The second session of the 106th Congress is
expected to adjourn by early October as lawmakers make their way home for
the fall campaign.

Brosnan said he hoped they could get to the provisions in a pending
bankruptcy reform bill dealing with derivatives contracts. The White House
and Congressional Republicans have been bogged down in negotiations over
bankruptcy for some time now. The issues of contention, however, have
revolved around consumer protection.

Brosnan said he hoped the comparatively non-controversial sections regarding
derivatives could be split from the bill and enacted separately if the
bankruptcy bill fails to show progress.

""It is my hope that that would occur and I think it would make for a safer
and sounder banking system,"" Brosnan said.

More sweeping reform, in the shape of a reauthorization and updating of the
Commodities Exchange Act, is also pending in Congress. The CEA includes the
structural framework for derivatives trading and regulation in the U.S. and
modernizing it has been a priority for some years among regulators and trade
groups.

However, differing versions of CEA modernization have been approved by three
committees in the U.S. House. Such divergent approaches are seen by many as
limiting the chances for passage.

""To the extent you could get one or both of those finalized in an agreeable
format, it would add certainty to U.S. banks,"" Brosnan said. By increasing
the legal certainty about the enforceability of derivatives contracts, it
would lower costs and keep business from moving overseas, he said.


Dow Jones International News, 9/7/00
UK ROAD TO EURO: Little Evidence of Euro-Creep in UK
By David Cottle

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- When high-profile industrial giants Toyota and Unilever
asked U.K. suppliers to price their goods in euros, many thought more
multinationals in the U.K. would follow suit, possibly making the euro the
effective business currency of the U.K. irrespective of a decision to join.

But so-called 'euro-creep', where the euro becomes the de facto currency for
British companies despite the U.K. retaining the pound, has so far failed to
materialize. U.K.-based businesses are still overwhelmingly loyal to
sterling despite big fluctuations against the euro.

""I think there is disappointment in official, pro-Europe circles that there
hasn't been as much 'euro-creep' as hoped for,"" said Stephen Lewis, chief
economist at Monument Derivatives in London.

With Britain still undecided over whether it should adopt the euro, many in
the pro-euro lobby say the commercial reality faced by many companies
dealing with other European countries will mean they will end up having to
use the single currency, like it or not.

The issue gathered extra intensity recently when the British press
highlighted the issue.

Euro-creep Overstated

But many now say 'euro-creep' has been overstated.

""The fact is that euro-creep is hardly a factor at the moment,"" said David
Page, U.K. economist at Investec Research.

What is more, some analysts say that the euro has been almost as invisible
in many euro-zone countries, where local currencies continue to hold sway,
and will remain so at least until euro notes and coins come into circulation
in 2002.

There is an obvious temptation for companies with large operations in the
U.K. and significant sales in Europe to ask U.K. suppliers to invoice in
euros. This way they pass on the exchange risk down the supply chain.

""Most of Toyota's U.K. production goes to Europe,"" said an analyst at
consultants Business Strategies, ""so they'll lose significantly in terms of
the exchange rate and its volatility should their suppliers price in
sterling.""

But Business Strategies reckon that these companies are reacting to a strong
pound rather than displaying an undying loyalty for the single currency and
that the weakness of the euro is a factor in its unpopularity as a trading
currency.

Weak Euro Hobbles Acceptance

Others share this view.

""With the euro at current levels it would be odd to see a big push towards
it's use by European businesses,"" said Klaus Baader, senior international
economist at Lehman Brothers in London.

Of the companies that are using the euro in the U.K., Toyota says it will
only demand euro pricing from some of its new supply contracts.

""We have only asked a few of our new suppliers to tender in euros, and we
have no plans at all to extend that base,"" said Richard Ayres, a spokesman
for Toyota in the U.K.

Unilever, meanwhile, has invited all its British contractors to tender in
euros, but a spokesman for the company said it wasn't compulsory for them to
do so, nor were there any plans to make it so.

""We now obviously produce all our (financial) reports in euros and this is
just an extension of that,"" he added.

Banks' Trading Revenue Remains High, Quarterly OCC Derivatives Report Shows
By Adam Wasch

Although trading revenue was down from the record $3.84 billion recorded in
the
first quarter of 2000, U.S. commercial banks earned $3.03 billion from
trading
activities in the three months ending June 30, the Office of the Comptroller
of
the Currency reported Sept. 6.

The second quarter of 2000 represented only the third time the banking
industry has earned more than $3 billion from trading activities in a single
quarter. The first time it happened was in the first quarter of 1999, when
commercial banks earned $3.6 billion from trading, according to the OCC,
which released its quarterly Bank Derivatives Report. It has been six and a
half years since the seven banks most active in trading have lost revenue
from trading.

Trading revenue is earned from cash instruments and off-balance sheet
derivative instruments. A derivative is a financial instrument with a value
based on the performance of an underlying asset, interest rate, foreign
exchange rate, or other indexes. The OCC's quarterly report is based on
quarterly call report information provided by domestic commercial banks.

More Banks Using Derivatives

OCC also reported that the number of commercial banks holding derivatives
increased by 27 to 416. The notional amount of derivatives reported by
commercial banks grew 4.5 percent to a record high $39.3 trillion in the
second quarter. Most derivatives trading activity (96 percent), the OCC
explained, is used by banks in their capacity as a dealer to service bank
customers. The remainder is used to manage their own interest rate and other
financial risk positions.

""Contract volumes showed strong growth as bank customers managed risk
positions in an environment characterized by rising interest rates and
volatile and more uncertain market positions,"" said Mike Brosnan, OCC Deputy
Comptroller for Risk Evaluation, told reporters at a press briefing.

The average credit exposure from derivatives at the top seven trading banks
fell to 247 percent of risk-based capital, OCC said, although Brosnan still
called this a ""huge"" percentage. Credit exposure has declined since reaching
a record high of 324 percent of risk-based capital in the fourth quarter of
1998. ""There were no losses to speak of in the second quarter [of 2000],""
Brosnan said. ""The absence of past-dues and charge-offs [produced] a credit
quality of over-the-counter derivatives that is noticeably better"" than that
seen in most commercial and industrial loans portfolios, he said.

Most banks use derivatives to hedge credit risk, Brosnan said. The current
economic climate, with its relatively large global swings in interest rates,
gives banks added incentive to use derivatives, he said. Even so, less than
5 percent of banks currently use derivatives. But those that do are heavily
scrutinized because of the highly sophisticated nature of derivatives and
their potential to cost banks billions if deals go awry. ""We watch banks'
derivative activity to a disproportionate degree,"" Brosnan said.

Derivative Bills Pending in Congress

Three separate but similar bills are pending in Congress that would offer
more predictability for derivatives market participants if their transaction
counterparties fail.

The bipartisan provisions, which the OCC supports, provide derivatives
greater legal definition. The relevant language appears in pending
bankruptcy reform legislation, legislation to reform the Commodities
Exchange Act, and in a stand-alone bill (H.R. 1161) introduced by House
Banking Committee Chairman James A. Leach (R-Iowa) and passed by the banking
committee July 27. Such legislation would ""add certainty"" to the U.S.
derivatives market, Brosnan said, and prevent derivatives trading activity
from migrating to other countries that better legally define derivatives.
""If nothing happens [in Congress], it would not be a disaster, but I hope it
would occur,"" he said.

Report Confirms Trends

The notional volume of foreign exchange derivatives leveled off in the
second quarter at $6.5 trillion. Continuing a trend, interest rate
derivatives rose to a record $31.4 trillion. Since 1997, when banks first
began reporting data on credit derivatives, the notional volume of these
contracts has increased from $55 billion to $362 billion during the most
recent quarter, according to OCC.

Also, there has been a ""pronounced and continued shift"" in the kind of
derivatives contracts banks use. Brosnan noted that as the volume of swap
contracts has nearly doubled to $21 trillion since the second half of 1998,
the volume of futures and forwards ($10.3 trillion), and options ($7.7
trillion) has all but leveled off during the same period. Brosnan said that
this was due primarily to bank customers' preference for over-the-counter
derivatives contracts such as swaps, which can be tailored to meet a
customer's specific risk management needs.

Other trends include the increasing popularity of one-to-five year equity
contracts, which rose 27 percent in notional amounts. Equity contracts of
less than a year have also become more popular, OCC said.

The OCC's latest quarterly report is available on the agency's Web site at
http://www.occ.treas.gov/ftp/deriv/dq200.pdf.

New Horizon Electric Cooperative Inc. v. Duke Power Company, EL00-101-001. 
Order on Rehearing. Order issued October 11, 2000 addressing a complaint by 
New Horizon Electric Cooperative, Inc (New Horizon) against Duke Power Co. 
(Duke) seeking FERC resolution of four disputed issues, including treatment 
of energy imbalances not prevented by dynamic scheduling. New Horizon's 
complaint claimed that energy imbalance service does not apply to it, since 
it will employ dynamic scheduling to effectively remove its load from Duke's 
control area. Further, New Horizon maintained that any deviation between the 
dynamic schedule and the actual metered delivery of energy constituted 
inadvertent interchange energy (which is the net difference between actual 
and scheduled interchange energy between two control areas) and proposed that 
any differences would be returned in-kind within two hours. On November 9, 
New Horizon filed a request for rehearing or clarification of the October 11 
Order. Order issued February 26 granting New Horizon's request for rehearing 
or clarification of the October 11 Order. Order clarifies that, to the extent 
dynamic scheduling by New Horizon operates successfully; New Horizon should 
not be subject to charges under Duke's Schedule 4 Energy Imbalance Service. 
In such circumstances, any imbalances between energy deliveries on behalf of 
New Horizon and New Horizon's load should be accounted for by Duke as 
inadvertent interchanges only. In addition, Order directed parties to 
negotiate in good faith to establish a standard for the successful operation 
of dynamic scheduling.

I may be behind in the e-mail discussions - I have not downloaded remote in
the last 2 days so this issue may be resolved by now.  Also I may not fully
understand the concern as e-mails are imperfect.

However, I'm not sure the ""customer wait for FERC order"" option helps with an
orderly process for interconnections.  Suppose the non-signing customer is
first in the queue.  Suppose the second in queue customer is happy with the
FIOA, signs and wants construction to start.  If the second customer
facilities depends on building facilities for the first customer we have an
impasse, a  mess.  We need to find a way for the first customer to resolve
legitimate problems with a FIOA and not hold up other interconnection
customers.  How can we do this?

>>> Nicolay, Christi 03/21/01 08:46AM >>>

Jay--Couple notes:

FERC has stated in several orders what it considers ""material changes"".  You
may want to look at Duke and Consumers procedures to make sure you are Ok with
the interpretations.  Those are some of the orders that I would look to should
a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change.

Also, per your comments on No. 16.  I agree with you on ""commenced
construction.""  What I mean by ""commenced"" includes the utility purchase of
easements, etc.  I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing to
live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to proceed
and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the costs. 
[[Customer may want to wait to proceed until it sees the FERC decision.]] 
Thanks.

663,"The revised response is attached.

I talked with Joe Eisenberg and told him we'd like the Amend. 22 proceeding 
included.  He said this primary objective is to have everything proceed in 
one forum.  However, he is concerned about giving people an opening to tack 
on additional matters.  I said that at a minimum we wanted clarity whether 
anything other than the 3 Charge-Back matters were covered by the motion.  He 
said there was no problem clarifying if his client wouldn't agree to include 
the Amend. 22 matter.

As many of you know the PX sued the ISO regarding funds paid by PG&E to the 
ISO that should have gone to the PX.  I asked Joe why the creditors weren't 
generally informed this was in the works, and why they filed in district 
court if he's trying to ""channel"" all proceedings.  He said he wasn't really 
aware the action was filed (it was filed by another firm).  He had sought 
retention of that firm but he thought it was going to be handled throught the 
""administrative process"".  It seems like there needs to be more focus at the 
PX, especially since they're spending the participants money.

Title: Viewing Environmental Strategy Issues in a New Light

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2758;


***********************************************************************

STRATEGIC CHALLENGES GROW IN ENVIRONMENTAL ARENA

The issues that are most prominent in the environmental arena are notable for
their relatively long time horizons. Thus, although the uncertainty created by
recent events might cause adjustments in environmental strategies it is less
likely to result in fundamental shifts in direction. In the immediate future,
however, the challenge will be in responding to a shifting landscape while
maintaining long-term objectives.

* Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are forging ahead with final negotiations,
while the US focus is on when a domestic climate change policy might appear.

* The European Union is moving toward development of a unified greenhouse gas
emissions trading scheme, while individual European nations are developing or
implementing their own (potentially incompatible) systems.

* Continued technology maturation combined with heightened energy security
concerns is solidifying the foundation of the renewable energy niche, bringing
increased focus on remaining technical and political hurdles.

Definitions:
Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport and storage agreements or unhedged natural positions.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

677,"There are two Hiltons in central Bath, both a short walk from the office, the 
Roman baths, the antique shops, etc.  I haven't stayed at either.  They're 
both fairly modern hotels, so I'm sure they'll have all the stuff one needs 
for business, but probably no charm if that's what you or your wife like.

The Royal Crescent is very special.  It's more luxurious, with a spa and 
stuff, and less of the standard business hotel.  It's about a mile from the 
city center, but literally part of the famous Royal Crescent built by John 
Nash, the great Regency Period architect who designed Regent Street in 
London, etc.  Of course, I'm sure it's a lot more expensive, but I believe 
Wessex has a special rate there.

As for London, the Athenaeum is nice--modern, but in the midst of all the 
good stuff in Mayfair.  It's around a 15-minute walk from Enron's new office 
(and probably 15 minutes by taxi, given the one-way streets and traffic!).  
Our meetings will be in the City (ie, downtown), which is inconvenient to 
everyone but  where all lawyers, bankers, etc. have their offices.  Mayfair 
has many of the good restaurants, plus a lot of the good shops along Bond 
Street.  For a Mayfair location, the Athenaeum can't be beat.

My wife, Dede (who's coming with me), and I will stay at the Sheraton 
Belgravia.  It's about 1/4 from where we used to live,  and very close to the 
shopping along Sloane Street, Walton Street, and Knightsbridge (Harrods, 
etc.).  It's also 10 m inutes from Enron's new offices.  Other  good choices 
in that area are the Hyatt Carlton Tower, the Hyde Park (just revamped as 
part of the Mandarin chain), and the Berkeley (the latter two being very 
expensive).

By the way, if you haven't been to the UK lately, don't both with travellers 
checks, etc.--your US ATM card will work everywhere, and there's an ATM 
machine about every 15 feet in London and Bath.","John

Would you also help me think of a good name for this portfolio (#3)?  I'm struggling with it a bit - if I just say Transportation and Distribution, it's misleading because Elektro and related assets are excluded, if I add ""Domestic"" to the name, it wouldn't cover Wessex, etc..  Take a quick look at the descriptions of the portfolio categories below, and you'll see how I'm trying to capture the entire company, but carve your businesses out.

Another question - is it valid to distinguish trading activity included in Enron's DPR and that carried out - or to be carried out - by your businesses (PGE, ETS, EOTT), as all the activity in your companies is accrual accounting?  Or will some be marked to market?

Thank you,
Cassandra

at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: ""Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue.""
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.",Copp swain Franz Houston Ballet William atre Imp Karen Dacko Frederic Franklin Peter Farmer Anne Heaton Desmond Heeley Carl Cunningham,,"AZURIX ENRON Corporate Sponsors Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre

As far as the holidays go, I don't really care one way or the other.  If you need me to work I will, but if somebody else really wants the extra money I don't mind not working.  If I had my preference I would rather work Christmas than Thanksgiving so I could go to College Station and watch the Aggies smack around the over-rated Longhorns (be sure to show that part to Reece).  As far as vacation I would like to take off Nov. 2-5 and then maybe some time around Thanksgiving if I'm off.  I still have all of my vacation and I'm not sure how much I can carry over.  One other thing, some buddies of mine are going to Vegas the weekend of Oct. 27, I'm scheduled to work Sat. Night with two other guys, I would take a vacation day that day if you think we can get by with just two people on a Sat night.  Anyway, I'm not real particular, if you need me to work I'll be there if not then I won't.  See you Thur.

Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.

Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

760,"As a result of the Sept 11 attacks on the US, NERC Security Coordinators are being relied upon by the FBI and the DOE to report to them any threats or attacks on the US electric grid.   Security Coordinators have also discussed operating the grid under restricted access condtions during ""heightened awareness"".  There is no clear indication what the operators will do differently at times of heightened alerts.  However, it may be so extreme as shutting down interfaces and drastically reducing transfer capability.  Such actions may not be noticed on OASIS.  We are arguing that such actions should - to greatest extent possible - attempt to not disrupt markets.

Please report to me or Susan Lindberg, any suspicous denials or TLRs that you think may have been enacted as a result of such security actions.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

NERC           -Will reduce to  Alert level 2.5, something between full
alert status and heightened alert.
          - CIPWG continues to work on level definitions.  Still a week or
two away from completion.

NIPC      - Reports that threats are of general nature, still considered
high risk and of a lasting threat.
          - Most reports into NIPC are presently bio-threat related.

DOE       - Will reduce to Level 3 modified at noon today.  Note:  SECON-3
          is used when an increased and more predictable threat of
          terrorist activity exists and may increase access controls to
          include additional personnel and vehicle barriers.   DOE had been
          in a SECON-2  which is used when a terrorist incident occurs or
          intelligence information is received indicating that some form of
          terrorist action is imminent, and requires specific protection

777,"Brief from today's (October 16) daily NERC Security Call:

NERC           -Continue in Alert level 2.5, something between full alert
status and heightened alert.
          - CIPWG continues to work on level definitions.  Still a week or
two away from completion.

NIPC      - Reported possible bomb threat at Nuclear Plant in ERCOT.
However, ERCOT reports that security at Plant was unaware of threat.

DOE       - Continue at SECON level 3 modified.  Note:  SECON-3 is used
          when an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist
          activity exists and may increase access controls to include
          additional personnel and vehicle barriers.

SC's      -A suspcious substance received in the mail forced a Mid-Atlantic
          Electric Utility to evacuate their control center.  Local
          authorities determined the substance to be non-toxic and allowed
          all personel to return to the building.
          -Two unidentified indivduals tried to gain access to a Midwest
          EHV station via the station gate.  They escaped without being
          apprehended.
          -A Power Plant in the Southwest recieved a phone call in which
          the caller stated ""you are being watched.""  The caller then
          hanged-up.
          -A Power Plant in the Southwest reported that two suspcious
          people showed up at the Plant gate stating that they were college
          students and that they wanted a tour of the Plant.  The security
          guard refused them access and asked them to leave.  They refused
          to leave.  The guard went to his truck to radio the situation in,
          at which time the suspects fled.  Their vehicle had no plates on
          the front and the guard was unable to read the rear plate.

778,"Good news.  It sounds like MISO will offer a way to handle losses financially.  Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially.  I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.

Now, for the Important Question.  MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15.  I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path).

If this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP.  Also let me know how prevalent that practice is.  MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15.  While they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline, they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem.

Dear Mr Stanley C. Horton:

There's plenty of advice for managers floating around out there...some of it very good and some of it downright disastrous.  The trick, of course, is knowing which is which.

That's exactly what Harvard professor Chris Argyris proposes to show you in his new book, Flawed Advice and the Management Trap: How Managers Can Know When They're Getting Good Advice and When They're Not.  For more details, read the book review section in the current issue of strategy+business.

In the same issue, you'll find a generous handful of other great books discussed. The Knowing-Doing Gap: How Smart Companies Turn Knowledge into Action is a good example...so is Silicon Valley's New Immigrant Entrepreneurs, by AnnaLee Saxenian.  And you won't want to miss the s+b review of The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life or Absolut: Biography of a Bottle.

Reviews of important business books are just part of the reason strategy+business is eagerly awaited by the select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send complimentary issues.

While we're on the subject of complimentary issues, I should mention that our records indicate you have been receiving s+b since Jun 13 00.  There is no reason why you cannot keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free...especially if you make arrangements now.

To make sure you continue receiving your complimentary strategy+business subscription, just click on the following link:

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

In addition to Eric's questions below, I have an even more fundamental question, are the two scenarios (3 frame 6's, 2 frame 7's) additive or cummulative?  In other words, are we looking at planning on 130,000 lb/hr or 190,000 lb/hr?  Obviously, all these considerations make a difference in terms of design/cost.


",Steve Eric,,
794,"To All
I have done a cursory review of the requirements of the agencies contacted, and 2 significant itmes leap out.

#1 New Mexico BLM Permitting - Cultural Resources
David Simmons - Archeologist - Farmington BLM office quoted "" Navajo ROW costs usually approximately $1MM/mile"". THIS COULD MAKE AN UNECONOMICAL PROJECT FROM DAY 1

#2 Longest permit times are 1 year, which means that with a tentative schedule as follows:
FERC Filing - Sept/01 to March 30/02
FERC Approval - April 1/02 - April 1/03 - 1 year
Construction - April 1/03 - Jan 1/04 - 9 mos 

In order to start construction by April 1/03 to achieve an in service in early 2004, application for specific long lead permits will need to be made April 1/02. This will require significant field work and design details prior to April 1/02. I doubt we will be ready to commit to such an undertaking this early in the process.

I suggest after the ENSR fatal flaw analysis is complete, a very comprehensive review of all permits and their relation to the critical path is undertaken.

We have been collecting requirements for a new Rates, Allocations and Invoicing System and have some preliminary estimates to develop a new system for all 3 pipes.  There are significant savings on the IT side by replacing the 3 separate systems with a new application.  However, the IT savings are not enough to justify the entire project.  I know that you all have needs on the business side to address negotiated rates and discounts along with automation of invoicing where these rates are used.  I know that there is a lot of manual efforts with the existing systems, but I need your input as to whether you would have business savings, efficiencies, etc.. with replacing these applications.  Could you all provide some business justification for such a project?  If so, what would the savings and/or efficiencies be?  Could you quantify?  Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

looking forward to the cooler weather.  I got some good bargains on post 
winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about 
buying a sweater!  I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one 
sitting!

My backyard is really looking good.  It's almost all planted, maybe 90% 
done.  I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer 
Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).  It will be a 
while before they look like trees, though.  Right now they kinda look like 
tall bushes.  I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft. 
plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little 
little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about 
7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.  They're in pots, because I'll have 
to take them in during hard freezed.  I've planted lots of climbing pink, 
yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.  It will take a while before 
they fill out.  Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot 
of color.  Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over 
Houston.   I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds 
and butterflies.  I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a 
bit.  Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit.  
I need a little sun to make them bloom.  And then there's my St. Francis 
fountain.  He's just lovely!

Also, the central air is done.  No more noise from window units.  Now he's 
painting my bedrooms, the front one a real pale blue, and the back one a real 
pale pink.  I hope when I get back from Europe it will all be over and I can 
start cleaning up all the dust.  I'll have 3 days to recuperate because of 
the 4th of July holiday.

You and Sue were going to spruce up your garden a bit.  Have you been able to 
do anything?  I'm so glad I got to see your house.  Now when you talk about 
things I can picture what you're talking about.

Also, when I get back from Europe I'm going to get some cats again.  I'm 
looking forward to that.  I think I'm finally over mourning the demise of 
poor Willow.

Mark said he didn't have a lot of time to visit with you when he was there 
because you were in Teeside a lot of the time.  I'm sorry he didn't get a

835,"I believe that this was authored by James Carville:


NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to
court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World
Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press
conference earlier today.  They were joined by members of the Major League
Players Union. ""We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,""
said the Mets batting coach.  ""We were confused by the irregularities of
the
pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit.""

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters
had
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the
press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of
the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the
Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. ""The fact remains that
some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit,"" said
the Mets
batting coach. ""The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are
celebrating prematurely.""Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of
all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by
the
umpires of each game. ""While some of the strikes called against the Mets
were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome
of
the World Series,"" the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal
claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won
the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.

""It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees,""
said

a Mets spokesman.  ""The World Series crown is rightly ours.""The manager of
the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging
for exercise.  He has stated that he believes ""we need to let the process
run its course without a rush to judgment.""

Why I Fired My Secretary

Two weeks ago was my 45th birthday, and I wasn't feeling too hot that morning 
anyway. I went to breakfast knowing my wife would be pleasant and say ""Happy 
Birthday,"" and probably have a present for me. She didn't even say ""Good 
Morning,"" let alone any ""Happy Birthday."" I thought,""Well, that's wives for 
you. The children will remember."" The children came in to breakfast and 
didn't say a word. When I started to the office I was feeling pretty low and 
despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary, Janet said, ""Good 
Morning Boss, Happy Birthday."" And I felt a little better; someone had 
remembered. I worked until noon. Then, Janet knocked on my door and said,""You 
know, it's such a beautiful day outside and it's your birthday, let's go to 
lunch, just you and me."" I said, ""By George, that's the greatest thing I've 
heard all day.  Let's go."" We went to lunch. We didn't go where we normally 
go; we went out into the country to a little private place.  We had two 
martinis and enjoyed lunch tremendously.  On the way back to the office, she 
said,""You know, it's such a  beautiful  day. We don't need to go back to the 
office, do we?"" I said, ""No, I  guess not."" She said, ""Let's go to my 
apartment."" After arriving at  her apartment she said, ""Boss, if you don't 
mind, I think I'll go into the  bedroom and slip into something more 
comfortable."" ""Sure,""  excitedly replied. She went into the bedroom and, in 
about six minutes, she came  out carrying a big birthday cake, followed by my 
wife, children, and dozens of our friends. All were singing Happy Birthday...

Per Sheila's inquiry and at Sara's direction, I called Ken Raisler at

so without concern.  He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in 
using ""exchange"" in your corporate name, however, putting ""exchange"" in a 
company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny.

would look at when Tom Gros wanted pooling points up and running, we would 
then look at Hamachi's pooling point sites and come up with requests to

Thanks for the note - and congratulations on yours as well.  

I haven't had too much to do yet with the research guys here as they're 
pretty much self directed.  Once a week (Thursday AM) I've started a joint 
project update meeting with Structuring and Research.  I hope this way the 
Structuring team can bounce quantitative issues off Research and the Research 
guys can stay closer to the commercial deals.

The program for the 2000 Texas Finance Festival has been formalized and can
be found on our web site at

http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html

I do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on San Antonio.
First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations.
At last count there were only 6 rooms left.  Second, I need a completed
application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.
I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
form.

Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday
so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you
can.  Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the
plaza from the hotel).

We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
Friday and Saturday evenings.  The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m.
so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
Alamo at 8:00 p.m.  For Saturday we are still working out plans for the
evening so stay tuned.

There will be more information later as the conference nears.  Looking
forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio.

I have been a bit quiet here since reaching India, primarily because of the 
delay in the arrival of the Henwood team from Australia.

They are finally arriving on Sunday, and Krishna is joining me in Mumbai on 
Sunday evening itself.

I would like to fix a schedule to have a conference call with you on the data 
and the type fo questions that you all would like to ask.

Stinson - Could you please tell me what time would be a good one for you all 
to hae a confernce call, but not earlier than Monday evening, India time 
(Monday morning Houston time).  Please jot me a note on what would be a good 
time for the call.

I will work out an agenda for the call.  Primarily, it will be discussion of 
the data and on what runs we should do to begin with.

Another key part of this will be the Rate Case that MSEB is filing, because 
this will determine what wil be MSEB's paymet capability in 2001/02.  This is 
critical for us.  We have our in-house expert who has been working on this 
for some time now, and he will also present some of the material on that call.

so that you have an opportunity to look at it, if you havent already got it.

FYI, we had a couple of new Total Return Swap deals on board. And the 
following is the updated list:

5.Corn Husker

12. Riverside 3 and 6
13. Riverside 9/EEP5 & ECTRL
14.ETOL(New)
15..Margaux

To Hawaii 125 Series, most of them is to monetize New Power Company warrants 
which are convertible to New Power Company stocks. And there is one to 
monetize the future cash flow expected from Blockbuster to EBS. 

There is a significant difference in recent FAS 125 deals from previous ones, 
the underlying assets are more liquid assets such as warrants and stocks 
rather than power plants and pipelines, therefore, it is relatively easier to 
simulate the asset valuation.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!

certain format) and output the results into an Access data table of certain
format.  Once the programmer is assigned, I will go through the model
with him and incorporate his ideas and Ken's, then we can start coding.

in my e-mail below I pointed out to a inconsistency in the portfolio 
hierarchy for UK positions in RisktRac that I found out, 
namely: some books (for example E1SB1 and E1SB2) belong to UK-GAS portfolio 
and to UK-POWER portfolio.
I wanted to clarify this in order to reconcile positions in RisktRac and in

I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting
with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them
a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us 
their progress implementing risk management practices.

I shall arrange the meeting and get RAC involved.
Would you like to meet them for a short courtesy meeting 
(5 - 10  minutes)?

Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
(given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8,
at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.

Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization 
that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group 
comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from 
Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job 
of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The 
greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast.  
They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were 
moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve 
an ""A+"".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would 
stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our

Dear CERA.com Client:

We are pleased to announce the impending release of the new CERA.com!

make this new web experience available to you.

As you will soon see for yourself, CERA.com has undergone a significant 
upgrade, featuring such improvements as:

? enhanced navigation;

? improved search engine;

933,"David: 
 On #1, I would say the problem is not with the calculation part, but with 
the market information, or lack thereof (i.e., illiquidity). The gas desk is 
responsible for the supplying prices and volatilities. It is upto them to 
decide how they want to account for illiquidy: change the bid/offer spreads 
accordingly, or add hedging costs, or something else. And on the 
correlations, they do matter but not as much as volatility or price. Since 
these are correlations for the same underlying at the same location across 
time, I think we can make some reasonable assumptions and compute them.

 Regarding #2, I don't agree with the concept of a market top. What the desk 
does with the options is to hedge them. And the way to hedge them is hedge 
teh delta and exercise the options optimally at the same time.

 Finally, I don't think we can use a 2-year swap as a proxy for a 10-year 
swap. Longer term prices and volatilies are driven by the cost of production 
and economic variables and their uncertainities. Those don't necessarily 
reflect the shorter term issues.

Have a great Thanksgiving,
Krishna.

I am writing to bring to your attention a GSIA student, John Gordon, who is
currently being considered for Enron's Associates program.  My understanding
is that Mark Courtney and Andrew Miles at Enron are championing John as a
late addition to the program.

While I know Enron doesn't routinely recruit at GSIA, John would be an ideal
candidate if you are willing to make an exception.  He is a terrific finance
student with a strong transcript; including an A+ in my Options class. Since
John has an engineering/energy background, he asked early on for additional
background reading about finance and energy.  John is personable and
outgoing.  Normally the job market for someone of John's caliber would have
already cleared, but I have been told that there are dual career issues at
play here.

I would be very appreciative if you would take a look at John.  A copy of
his resume is attached to this email.

Best regards,
Duane

Attached please find a draft Consulting Agreement for use with Henwood.  

You will want to review it before you send it to Henwood.  Please see Section 
6 in particular.  Also, I put in that arbitration will be in Houston and 
Texas law will apply.  We could move that to New York, with New York law if 
that is better for Henwood.  If pressed, we could make it Singapore or U.K. 
law, with arb in Singapore.  but any other law, including Australian law, 
would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel--so 
I strongly urge you to argue for Texas or NY law (no other state, please).

I tried to make this Agreement reflect the terms in Henwood's proposal, and 
believe I succeeded.  Our form has some additional terms not contained in 
their Proposal, as well as FCPA boilerplate (ie., the ""Business Conduct"" and 
""Drug Policy"" language).  Also, I just want to point out that this Agreement 
allows them to subcontract the work--but only with our written agreement.  
Under their Proposal, the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost 
plus 15%--so you might not want to do it.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

The program for the 2000 Texas Finance Festival has been formalized and can
be found on our web site at

http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html

I do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on San Antonio.
First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations.
At last count there were only 6 rooms left.  Second, I need a completed
application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.
I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
form.

Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday
so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you
can.  Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the
plaza from the hotel).

We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
Friday and Saturday evenings.  The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m.
so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
Alamo at 8:00 p.m.  For Saturday we are still working out plans for the
evening so stay tuned.

There will be more information later as the conference nears.  Looking
forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio.

984,"Hi Sheridan,

How are you?  I hope that you had a good vacation.  Vasant and I looked at 
your memo and found it to be interesting.    I shall first briefly summarize 
our understanding of the methodology you propose.  The comments follow.  
Finally, I shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case 
in further refining the model.

It appears that you are proposing a state-space approach where probabilities 
of different states at various future dates are specified.  The next step is 
to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the 
branches from the origin to one of the terminal points.  Traversing through 
the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the 
average present value of the project.  Also, you are using the simulation to 
assign a value of the project to each node.  Thus each node will have a cash 
flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value 
which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward.   If some 
of these values turn out to be negative, zero-coupon, risk-free bonds are 
purchased to neutralize the negative realization. 

Next, we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our 
project (based on the variance of the returns) .  We iterate until 
convergence.

Finally, we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital 
from the PV of the gross cash flows (including debt) to determine if the 
project merits further consideration.

Comments/Clarifications

1.  The money is being set aside to avoid negative values.  It is not clear 
if you mean the values of the cash flow or the PV at the node.  Anyhow, we 
shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at 
that cross-section of time as the risk-free asset pays in all states of 
nature.  This will have to be done every time there is a negative 
realization.  Thus, for the typical project we have, the value of risk 
capital may be extremely high, as we are not following a tail-based norm 
anymore.

2.  Your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all 
values being positive.  If so, we are only issuing risk-free debt.  Also, a 
project with a single negative value at each cross-section of time will not 
have a positive debt capacity.

3.  It seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate, which is 
obtained in each step from the comparison investment (by equating the 
variances).  It is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an 
effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence.  Also, 
our project has a finite life and the market-based assets will have infinite 
lives.  In the light of this fact, how will we define the relevant variance?  
Is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment?

4.  Finally, our criterion is to subtract from the average PV the investment 
and also the risk capital.  Setting risk capital to zero, this model closely 
resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines 
the discount rate.  

Gas Field Case

To facilitate your thinking, we are providing a gas field example below.

We invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field.  A profile of 
expected production and variance of the production per year is available from 
the engineers at the beginning.  Production will be autocorrelated, as the 
profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or 
less than the estimated reserves.   We assume the life of the field to be 10 
years with no salvage value.  There are fixed and variable operating costs.  
It might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this 
problem.

Do let me know if you have further questions.

I have previously forwarded to you the Gramm changes that I received from Ken 
Raisler.  I recognise that we want to be extremely cautious about suggesting 
that we support any of the changes.  Nonetheless, it may be worthwhile going 
through the changes to see if they are beneficial to Enron.

For example, the changes being made to solve the ""Blackbird Issue"" (see p. 29 
and 30 of Gramm's changes) seem to be beneficial for Enron Online.  Also, 
Gramm's Swap exclusion language of section 107 seems broader than the 
existing language.

If Gramm were to ask Ken Lay if we were supportive of these changes how would 
we respond?  I have a hunch our response is that a perfect bill would be 
ideal, but it is not likely that such a goal is attainable in this Congress 
or the next Congress.  Nonetheless, I would appreciate help listing the 
changes that are helpful to enron and those we just don't care about.

N48875.DTL 
Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of 
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power 
crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share 
of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of 
California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private 
energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the 
state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting 
to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting 
against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and 
simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most 
of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying 
the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators 
who have also gouged California. 
""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across 
their face because they are robbing us blind,"" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state 
Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from 
Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are 
made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually 
used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most 
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and 
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped 
as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events 
that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover 
from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in 
receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, 
an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents 
subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged 
market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, 
received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged 
higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 
million.

09/21/2000 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - California regulators on Thursday approved 
an order allowing utility San Diego Gas and Electric to buy power through 
bilateral contracts. 
The utility had previously been mandated to buy all its power through the 
Pasadena-based California Power Exchange. 
The contracts can be for up to five years and must expire by December 31, 
2005. The amount of power that can be bought is limited but a CPUC spokesman 
could not immediately confirm details of the restriction. 
Last month, the California Public Utilities Commission allowed the state's 
other two investor owned utilities, Rosemead-based Southern California Edison 
and San Francisco-based Pacific Gas and Electric to buy power on bilateral 
contracts under similar terms. 
Wholesale electricity prices have risen to record levels this year, resulting 
in sharply higher power bills for SDG&E customers, who were the first in the 
nation to pay market-based prices without a safety net. 
The price spike for customers was exacerbated by a lack of hedging by SDG&E. 
The CPUC's move to allow bilateral contracts is seen as part of an attempt to 
encourage more hedging.

I won't be able to make the call on Monday.

I'd be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team.  It sounds
like there's no shortage of people who want to be on the committee.

My big issue is default service.  This industry needs real customers and
the only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service.
Starting with big customers, along the lines of the core/non-core gas
model, is the best way to go.  The only way to sell this, however, is to
get the big customers to agree it's a good idea.

1029,"Dear David,

I'm so glad you asked for an update!

We have indeed had an interesting development regarding the Electricity Bill 
since your visit.  You will recall that in AMCHAM's briefing, it was 
positively noted that the drafting process of the Electricity Bill had been 
transparent and that a draft that would provide a blueprint for the 
restructuring of the electricity sector to move toward competitive markets 
was attained.  Noone was 100 percent satisfied (probably the mark of a good, 
passable bill) but many  agreed to the draft and felt, while not perfect, it 
would achieve the desired reform.

We have learned that there are actually two drafts of the Electricity Bill 
sponsored by the Ministry of Power.  The first has been developed by NCAER 
(NCAER draft) in a very transparent process with seven iterations and 
comments from 190 parties.  NCAER was hired as a consultant for this purpose 
by the Ministry of Power.  At the time of Draft III, a second draft (MoP 
draft) was developed in the Ministry which subsequently incorporated some but 
not all of the NCAER draft provisions negotiated in the transparent process.  
It was the MoP draft that was sent to the Group of Ministers and has been 
worked on by the Ministry of Law.

The draft, however, was never introduced in Parliament.  The industry 
discovered the existence of the second MoP draft immediately prior to 
Minister Kumaramangalam's hospitalization and lobbied him and Secretary Basu 
heavily to introduce the NCAER draft in Parliament or, at a minimum, allow a 
transparent commenting process on the MoP draft.  

Several parties in the industry have now been given the MoP draft, and 
Secretary Basu has said he would entertain comments.  (How widely it has been 
distributed is unknown.)  In addition, the death of the Minister, who was a 
staunch advocate of reform, and the lack of a named successor, has now left 
things somewhat uncertain.

The issues as they now stand are:

The existence of two separate Ministry-sponsored drafts, only one of which 
was subjected to a wide sector review process.
The need to use the product of a transparent, commenting process once it has 
been formulated.  
The fact that the fine-tuned balance of interests and clear blueprint for a 
transition to competitive markets achieved by the NCAER draft has been lost 
in the MoP draft.  For example, the clear deregulation of price provisions in 
the tariff section have been removed so that there is, in the MoP draft, full 
regulation of price by the state commissions; however, in the state 
commission section, there is a provision that allows the State Commission to 
permit access to a consumer class and only determine the wheeling charge 
(rather than the wheeling and supply price) for that class when it has so 
determined.   Thus, there is  an apparent conflict within the statute 
regarding the regulation of commodity priceand uncertainty regarding access 
to end users.  (There are many such examples.)

Action Item:  Either support the NCAER draft and send it to the Ministry of 
Law for legal fine tuning (Basu mentioned that the ""form"" of the NCAER draft 
was not right), or repeat the iterative, transparent commenting process with 
regard to the MoP draft.  hWe recommend supporting the NCAER draft because it 
reflects a balance of the multiple sector interests.  It is the first such 
document produced through an open process in India and was a process 
sponsored by the Ministry -- for that reason alone, the Ministry should 
promote and support the NCAER version.

Any assistance you can render on this issue will be greatly appreciated by 
many parties in the sector.  Let us know how it goes.

Sincerely,  
Jane Wilson

1044,"I met with a contact at the Department of State Global Affairs division today.  While much was up in the air given last week's events, here is some information on where things stand for now:

1) The U.N. and Morocco intend to hold the next set of climate change negotiations (COP-7) as planned in late October. Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky is scheduled to attend, but that could change.  

2)  If the negotiations go forward, the U.S. will not seek to delay action by the other nations, but will engage to protect U.S. interests (consistent with their approach in Bonn in July);

3) Jim Connaughton, head of the White House's Counsel on Environmental Quality, has taken the staff lead on developing the Bush Administration's alternative.  While Connaughton has expressed confidence that he can put a plan together (timeline uncertain -- but aiming for COP-7), some feel that is ambitious given the political divide on this issue within the Administration, and especially given the current focus on security and a response to the terrorist attacks last week.  With regard to COP-7 timing, I would agree on both counts.

I will work with Pat and Jeff on follow-up with CEQ to get up to speed on their current thinking and offer our expertise as appropriate.

Don mentioned that you were interested in the likelihood of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals on the sale to Duke.  

According to Andrews & Kurth, it is about 99% likely that we will ultimately receive the necessary Hart-Scott-Rodino approval from the DOJ / FTC.  It is possible, but not likely, that we will receive follow up questions and even a second request but we should be able to answer any such questions to the regulators' satisfaction.  A&K also cautioned that this 99% figure was a based on a quick analysis.

With respect to the required approval from the FERC, I was sure to speak to Sam Behrends of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene and MacRae (he worked on both of the other peaker sales) prior to finalizing the PSA about the likelihood of getting FERC approval.  He indicated that he thought it would be a ""slam dunk"" but I did not ask him to assign a numerical percentage figure to that.  I have a second call into him in order to get that number, but have not been able to reach him.  I will let you know ASAP.

Both companies are interested in further discussions.

Louise,

I hope that everything is well with you.  Much has happened during the past two weeks and I will try to be as brief as possible.

?	Based on conversations and internal decisions that have occurred, Tom Byargeon and myself have decided to dissolve Production Offshore by the end of second quarter.  I have spoken with John regarding this commercial structural change and have also renegotiated the 2001 Upstream Products expected margin to $30 MM.  (The expected budget from Production Offshore was $20 MM out of the $50 MM for Upstream Products.)
?	I have attached a document that Tom has drafted outlining the remaining project responsibilities, market representation, and personnel redeployment.

The following individuals within Production Offshore have yet to be redeployed :

1. Tom Byargeon - He has been offered an opportunity to work with Randy Maffett, Vice President - Wholesale Origination, EGM.  Tom also will be meeting with Dave Duran tomorrow morning to discuss opportunities that exist within Generation Investments or Northeast Power Origination. 

 In addition, I want him to consider leading the Ecommerce/ Producer One effort for Upstream Products.  I desperately need a dedicated senior commercial person with contract negotiations expertise that can also see the financing opportunities that exist for Producer segment (i.e., wellhead connects, metering and monitoring equipment, etc.) through a Producer One transaction.  However, Tom has surmised that higher commercial visibility will be achieved by working on the financing of large asset deals within EGM or perhaps, in Duran's group.  I have assured him that the commercialization of the back and mid office is just as important if not more important to Enron's upper management.  Plus, I feel the closing of these outsourcing transactions will be more numerous by the end of the year than the other origination opportunities offered.

I know that he greatly respects your opinion.  If you could contact him (x30650) or drop him an email with your commercial perspective, I am sure that the correspondence would be greatly appreciated. 

2. Kevin Miller - mostly likely will focus on marketing and closing Producer ecommerce transactions.  In addition, Kevin has a very strong crude and processing background.  This experience would complement the Producer One effort as well support the processing needs of the Wellhead desk.  He could have career opportunities with EGM, but overall, is very enthusiastic about ENA's Producer ecommerce commercial platform.

3. Kenn Loch - has a very technical background suited for deepwater projects.  Since the responsibility for Mariner is within ECR, Allan Keel may be interested in his background.  Also, since the responsibility for the MEGS/Pluto deal should be transferred to ECR,  Kenn would be an appropriate resource for that transaction as well.

4. Lisa Druzbik -  is very familiar with the accounting details behind MEGS/ Pluto.  Has opportunities are within ECR and EES.  Most of her background is within the E&P sector.

?	I have spoken with Scott Josey about the impending dissolution of Production Offshore.  Since MEGS/Pluto is a deal with Mariner (and since Enron owns 97% of Mariner, the deal is analogous to doing a transaction with oneself), he concurs with me that the transaction should be evaluated with the overall restructure or potential sale of Mariner.  Should I transfer over to ECR all 2001 capital charges and associated earnings related to MEGS/Pluto?  Should this transfer occur as of the beginning of the year or at the end of second quarter? The YTD margin associated with this project is approximately $ 3 MM.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards, Mrha

Update as of 0730CDT.

A.	Market Updates

U.S. Markets/Economic Updates

?	US equity markets expected to reopen Monday.  The SEC has announced it will allow coordinated buyback schemes to ""ensure an orderly market"" in the event of a market freefall upon Monday's opening.  The SEC is also expected to strongly restrict short-selling.
?	NYMEX closed Friday; ACCESS trading uncertain
?	CBOT/CME open Friday; full trading except for equity futures
?	Standard & Poor says the insurance system will be able to absorb up to $50 billion in losses from the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre.  Insurable losses of over $8 billion - $13 billion will dent individual insurers' balance sheets, it said. It emerged that only one of the World Trade Centre's towers was insured, because the possibility of a double accident was thought too improbable.

Europe
?	Brent Crude is trading up a $1.42 at $29.80 (0730CDT) on market anxiety about the possibility of imminent military operations in the Middle East.
?	In a probable preview of the NYSE opening on Monday, European equities' losses were spearheaded by sliding airline shares like British Airways, down 13 percent, and Alitalia, down 7.5 percent, as flights remained disrupted for a fourth day. The FTSE was down 1.7%, the CAC-40 down 2.67%, and the DAX was down 3.87% at 0715CDT.

FOREX

?	The dollar is down against the Euro at 0.9230 (0730CDT), as concerns over the status of the US economy are mounting, fueled in large part by bearish comments from European central bankers and politicians:
o	EU's Solbes: ""The possibility of recovery in the third quarter in the U.S. will be more reduced.""
o	SNB's Roth: ""Signs of an upturn in the cycle are not yet discernablein the US.""
o	ISAE's Padoa-Schioppa: ""U.S. attacks will squeeze economic growth and fuel inflation next year."" 

?	The bearish comments reconfirm the apparent lack of effective communications coordination among G7 leaders.  However, further steep currency declines should lead to coordinated intervention.

B.	Transportation/Infrastructure Updates

Gas/Power/Nuclear Infrastructure

?	The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to issue notationally an order that would allow interstate natural gas pipelines to roll into their rates the costs of security upgrades, according to industry sources cited by Natural Gas Intelligence. 
?	Tuesday's destruction of the World Trade Center has forced Montana Power Co. to delay its shareholder vote on the sale of its natural gas and power distribution assets for at least one week.

Refineries/Crude/Products

?	Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bingaman called on the FTC and Justice yesterday to monitor prices and prosecute any attempt to jack up races.
?	Senators discussed rigging gasoline prices at a Senate briefing yesterday, according to Sen. Conrad, who as you know chairs the Budget Committee.  He said Congress may take action soon to thwart any attempted price gouging.
?	Energy Sec. Abraham is encouraging consumers who encounter ""unjustified prices"" at retail fuel sites to report it to a DOE hotline.

Air Travel	

o	As widely reported in the media last night, two armed groups were detained at New York airports last night.  The groups were believed to be conducting another effort to hijack US airliners.
o	Logan Airport remains closed until further notice.
o	JFK, La Guardia, and Newark Airports closed after last night's arrests.
o	Other national airports operating on extremely limited schedule.
o	The State Department issued yesterday a Worldwide Caution for all US travelers.  The messages advises that travelers:

	""?maintain a high level of vigilance and increase their security awareness?. Maintain a low profile, vary routes and times for all required travel, and treat mail and packages from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. American citizens are also urged to avoid contact with any suspicious, unfamiliar objects, and to report the presence of the objects to local authorities. Vehicles should not be left unattended and should be kept locked at all times.""  

Political/Security Update

?	Taliban and bin Ladin operations in Afghanistan now the clear target; Taliban leaders vow revenge.
?	Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld recommended calling up members of the reserve, initially to help support the combat air patrols securing the skies over major American cities.  CABC believes that the reserve call-up will extend well beyond homeland defense and will include overseas deployments.
?	The political situation is growing more complicated as evidence mounts that nationals of the United Arab Emirates were involved in the attack.  The implication of these individuals from an oil-producing US ally raises the possibility of political sanctions or other non-military measures that could affect the oil market.
?	Congress, despite some misgivings from lawmakers over granting President Bush open-ended authority, moved to give the administration $40 billion to wage its antiterror initiative.  Again, CABC believes that $40 billion represents a sum big enough to cover operations well beyond simply improving homeland defense.",Brent Crude Solbes Roth discernablein Bingaman jack Conrad Abraham bin Ladin Donald H.

The PUC has not yet voted on suspension of DA or related matters.
Likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30-60 minutes.
Looks as if the decision will 1) suspend DA beginning Sept. 20th and 2) include contract renewal in the suspension.  
In addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision).
Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).

KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN VOTED ON YET AND THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY CHANGE.

Whistler/Blackcomb
British Colombia, Canada
    February 24-28, 2001

Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow

....and that's just what it's doing at spectacular Whistler/Blackcomb in
British Colombia, Canada!  The world's top-ranked slopes already boast a
31-inch base with a foot of new powder and 200 open trails!  So dust off
those skis, check out your equipment and pack your bags for the WPO Ski TAG!

Enjoy wonderful days skiing the best slopes with expert guides and
instructors, evening socials in the delightful restaurants at the base of
the mountains peppered with educational sessions including speakers like
Doug Forseth, SVP of Whistler/Blackcomb Operations.  A special evening is
planned for Tuesday the 27th, a celebration of New Orleans' Fat Tuesday!

The best of all worlds is the time spent with family and fellow WPOers
comparing runs, trails, moguls and even the occasional fall.  The rigors of
the day, the friendships of old and new, and the laughter and relaxation of
the evenings are sure to be a highlight of this winter season.

1123,"This message contains the latest issue of the CSIS Watch, focusing on U.S. 
involvement in Colombia and U.S.-South African relations.

For further information, contact the CSIS Director of Studies Office at 
202-887-0200, or reply to this e-mail.

*************************
U.S. Involvement in Colombia.

Edward Luttwak, CSIS senior fellow, says that the Colombian guerrilla groups, 
the FARC and ELN, aren't trained, aren't disciplined, and don't know how to 
shoot. How then do they control vast amounts of territory in southern 
Colombia? Because the Colombian army was never properly trained, asserts 
Luttwak. And the U.S. military is now teaching the Colombian army tactics 
that aren't appropriate for a jungle environment. Luttwak believes that the 
$1.3 billion aid package signed by Clinton to help the Colombian army is a 
mistake. Plus, whatever the United States does this year in terms of aid, it 
will have to do again next year.

Why is the United States getting involved?  The popular reason repeated on 
the Hill is to destroy the Colombian narcotics trade. Colombia contains most 
of the narcotics activity now, but that can easily move to a different 
country. The worst thing the United States could do, says Luttwak, would be 
to push the bulk of the coca production to a different Andean country in the 
""arc of fragility."" U.S. involvement also helps to mitigate the chances of 
the guerrillas overthrowing the civilian government, says Luttwak, noting 
that President Andres Pastrana's popularity is extremely low.

What then should the United States do? Luttwak's answer is to organize mobile 
training teams of people (as the United States did in El Salvador) to go into 
villages to create home guards, which would use weapons of a different 
caliber than the army. Luttwak asserts that this would work because people 
aren't divided politically at the village level. Such a solution, however, 
will not diminish narcotics trafficking.


The United States and South Africa: Drifting Apart?
The U.S.-South African relationship has undergone a significant shift, 
asserts Stephen Morrison, director of the CSIS Africa Program. The result of 
this shift is that the United States now feels that it needs South Africa 
much less than it did six years ago, while South Africa has come to value its 
relations with the United States much more than ever before.

For both countries, however, there has been a ratcheting down of 
expectations.  South African president Thabo Mbeki's May visit to Washington 
was marked by an anxiety that the next administration may reduce its contact 
with Africa. Thus, Mbeki attempted to reach out to a number of audiences-both 
the Bush and Gore camps as well as the U.S. Congress, corporate sector, and 
media. The response of the latter three was rather muted.

While the Gore-Mbeki Binational Commission proved that high-level 
intervention is essential to move forward on key issues, lacking was serious 
cooperation at the diplomatic level to respond to crises such as those in 
Congo, Angola, Zimbabwe, Sudan, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone. Plus, South Africa, 
fueled by protectionist interests, was largely ambivalent to the Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). It remains to be seen if the South African 
private sector will seize this opportunity.

Morrison says that in the future, the relationship will be evaluated 
according to the level of development of joint diplomatic initiatives in 
Zimbabwe and Congo, collaboration on the AIDS epidemic, security enhancement, 
trade and investment, and debt relief. Some form of the binational commission 
should remain in place for the next administration, warns Morrison, because 
otherwise there will be contentious wrangling over issues of trade and 
investment, international property rights, AIDS policy, and security.

1135,"Ken,

I have been working to put together the business agenda for the Management 
Conference in November.  The theme I am proposing is ""Reinventing Enron ... 
Again!""  I believe the theme is timely as we celebrate our 15 year history 
and address significant changes for the future.  

Attached is a draft of the agenda for your review.  I had an opportunity to 
run it by Jeff last week.  He was happy with the theme and the first day's 
schedule.  He asked that we keep the second day open given the changes that 
will likely develop between now and November.  He felt the second day might 
best be used to establish a new ""manifest"" for the company.   We will, of 
course, remain flexible.  However, I am showing you the agenda as Jeff saw it 
as an example of how the day might run.

Also, on the first day, we'd like to have a spokesperson from Blockbuster 
speak between Tom Peters and Gary Hamil.  Mr. Peters will help set the theme 
by discussing the need for successful companies to reinvent themselves.  Mr. 
Hamil will present tactical strategies for innovation.  Our thought is that a 
Blockbuster spokesperson could discuss their company's experience with 
reinvention -- they are in an interesting situation as the delivery 
mechanisms for their products are evolving.  Would you recommend we invite 
John Antioco, chairman & CEO, or Mark Gilman, president of New Media?  
Several have indicated that Mr. Gilman would be a more provocative speaker 
and better equipped to address the theme of reinvention.

I look forward to your feedback and/or suggestions.

Thanks,

 I was gone from the company (laid off 5 years ago) but returned 13 months ago and I just celebrated my tenth anniversary with the company and I would like to say that I am so proud to be back working for Enron.  Those five years I was gone, I never lost my allegiance to thecompany even though I was no longer an employee, I felt as though I was still a member of the Enron family.

I have always felt that Enron cared about its employees and in talking with some of my co-workers, those who have been here for a while, feel the same as I do.

Since you and I go to the same church  and are on the Trustee Board together

And I know how hard it is to contact you too.I am going to ask this very
informally...but  very sincerely... I have a LARGE favor of you...and I did
not want to ask YOU in public last Tuesday at GHP Ex. Committee  nor  at
lunch with Elizabeth Dole.

I am the new Chairman of  the Theatre Under the Stars  (TUTS) Board. I
preface my request with  that announcement  so you will know how important
this is to me as well as to  TUTS and  the city at large.

IT IS WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM AS WELL  AS GREAT HONOR...that
I tell you that  President and Barbara Bush  have  said YES to being the
Honorary Chairs of the May 18th,2002  Theatre Under the Stars (TUTS) Gala
...our opening night in the new Hobby Center for the Performing Arts .I know
you (very graceously) turned down my request to be a Theater Under the Stars
(TUTS)  Board member...but my favor NOW  is asking you and your lovely wife
to serve as Co- Chairs for that event along with George and Barbara. I have
a few other prominant Houstonians that I will be asking to Co-Chair  along
with you.And if you have anyone you think would be appropriate to serve with
you ...please let me know.


We have some grand ideas and need only your name and influence to make this
a successful evening for TUTS!You and your wife may be as involved or not
involved as you like!We would like to top the funds raised by this current
year's event that was Co -Chaired by Chuck  and Kim Watson .They helped TUTS
to raise over $350,000. We want to raise the bar for this event as it is a
World Premier Opening for an Internationally Reknown Organization....Theatre
Under The Stars.The new theatre holds 2600 people.We want every seat filled
for this event!


The Hobby Center -Music Hall Foundation Board will be having their own
opening Gala...I am sure you have already heard about it...It will be in
April or early May before ours as they are the landlord...we are the #1
tenant...they get to have their opening first ,of course!


Will you give this  request real consideration and say YES!


I would appreciate your answer as soon as you possibly can give it. As we
need to begin the next phase of the  planning asap.

Again, Please forgive my informal way of presenting this very important
Invitation!

Thank you for your communication advising as to the concern that the IRS
seems to have about non-profits and the internet.  In early February of
this year I filed a form 1023 seeking a tax determination letter for
""Technology For All"" a Texas non-profit corporation whose mission it is
to enhance the educational and economic opportunities of the
disadvantaged (""TFA"").  TFA has a strong board led by Ken Lay, the CEO
of Enron Corporation.  TFA has assisted its affiliates (all believed to
be tax exempt non profits) in building computer learning centers
(""CLC's"") where recycled computers and donated software are connected
over the Enron Broadband Network (donated to TFA) to a server farm that
delivers to the disadvantaged at the CLC's educational and other
content.  There are over 75 CLC's in Houston, some 25 in Colorado and we
are building affiliations that will build them across the country and
eventually all over the world.  The business plan for this contemplates
operations in excess of one billion by the end of five years.  However,
we have not yet received our tax determination letter.  We have found
that major contributors require a tax determination letter.

    I received a response from the IRS on May 3, 2000.  On May 11, 2000,
I responded with answers to the inquiries made by the IRS.  Then on June
8 I was advised that our application had been sent to the national
office.  On November 15 I received another letter from the IRS raising
some additional questions unrelated to the first response.  While there
were some that were of substance in the main they were pretty weak.  The
first question was something like ""What did we mean by disadvantaged?""

    My question to you is what do you think is best to get this going
and out of the IRS?  Should I ask our board members to use their
considerable political influence tocause the IRS to move this?  Back in
August I had Bill Archer give the Commissioner an invitation to finish
this.  It did not seem to work.  I do not wish for an effort on my part
to cause this to go to the bottom of some bureaucrats stack.     Your
advice would be appreciated.

Broadcom Unveils World's First Gigabit Ethernet Controller with Support
for PCI-X Standard=0F=3DBCM5700 Demonstrates Higher Performance and Lower C=
PU
Utilization Than Any Other Commercially Available Solution

IRVINE, Calif., Dec 11, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Broadcom Corporation
(Nasdaq:BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadba=
nd
communications, today extended its leadership position in Gigabit Ethernet=
=20
with
the introduction of the world's first Gigabit Ethernet Media Access Control=
ler
(MAC) chip that supports Peripheral Computer Interconnect (PCI) and PCI-X=
=20
local
bus interfaces for use in network interface cards (NIC) and LAN-on-Motherbo=
ard
(LOM) implementations.

The company's first Gigabit Ethernet MAC, the Broadcom(R) BCM5700, which co=
mes
with a comprehensive suite of software, sets a new standard in the industry=
=20
for
performance and on-chip integration. Broadcom's high performance 10/100/100=
0
BASE-T MAC is complemented by its broad family of Gigabit Ethernet transcei=
ver
chips and will enable the company to provide customers with complete
MAC/transceiver solutions that will drive down the cost of Gigabit Ethernet=
 in
next-generation servers, workstations, and desktop computers. Furthermore,
Broadcom's strategic alliance announced today with 3Com Corporation, the mo=
st
preferred brand and channel for network interface cards and LOM networking
solutions, will further accelerate customer migration from Fast Ethernet to
Gigabit Ethernet.

""By delivering leading edge MAC, transceiver and software technology with
unprecedented levels of integration, Broadcom is driving up performance whi=
le
driving down the price points to enable widespread adoption of Gigabit
Ethernet,"" said Marty Colombatto, Vice President and General Manager of
Broadcom's Networking Business Unit. ""Broadcom's initiative to develop Giga=
bit
MAC technology is strategic to our overall commitment to deliver to our
customers the highest level of integration and performance for the advancem=
ent
of corporate networks.""

Broadcom's first generation Gigabit Ethernet controller provides an
unprecedented level of integration, combining support for 10/100/1000 Megab=
it
per second (Mbps) operation, dual high-speed on-chip processors, 128KB of
integrated on-chip memory, advanced packet classification engines, and PCI
/PCI-X 1.0 local bus interconnects in a single-chip solution. Triple speed=
=20
(10,
100, and 1000 Mbps) support with standard-based auto-negotiation allows=20
server,
workstation and desktop computer manufacturers to build solutions that can
transparently interface with Ethernet, Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet
technology over the existing Category 5 cabling infrastructure, and provide=
s=20
an
easy path for migrating legacy 10 Mbps and 10/100 Mbps networks to Gigabit
speed.

The BCM5700 is the industry's first Gigabit MAC to incorporate the recently
approved PCI-X v1.0 local bus interface specification allowing data transfe=
r
rates of up to 1.066 Gigabytes per second between the controller and the=20
system.
Support for PCI-X enables Broadcom's Gigabit Ethernet MAC to maintain traff=
ic=20
at
Gigabit speeds in I/O intensive server applications where multiple=20
communication
and storage peripheral devices share the same I/O bus. Broadcom's support f=
or
the new PCI-X interface demonstrates the company's commitment to delivering
leading edge I/O technology for servers and workstations.

According to Bert McComas, analyst for InQuest Market research, ""By the mid=
dle
of 2001, we expect that PCI-X will be enabled in new mainstream server=20
platforms
from all leading server vendors. PCI-X builds on the momentum of PCI as the=
=20
most
widely supported I/O standard in the world, and defines a clear path to=20
satisfy
next generation server I/O performance demands.""

Gigabit Ethernet provides ten times the performance of today's 10/100 BASE-=
T
server, workstation, and desktop network connections. This leap forward in
performance is especially critical for today's servers and workstations tha=
t=20
are
already being bottlenecked by aging 10/100 Ethernet connections. With Inter=
net
traffic doubling every three to six months, accelerating the performance an=
d
communication speed of the server is critical for enhancing end-users'=20
Internet
and e-Business experience.

Early tests show the BCM5700 raises the bar for the competition in both
throughput and host CPU efficiency. By focusing on total performance of the
system, the architecture of the BCM5700 enables servers and workstations no=
t
only to communicate faster but also to reduce the consumption of valuable=
=20
system
resources needed to reach Gigabit communications speeds.

PCI-X is an extension of the widely accepted PCI standard for data transfer
between CPUs and I/O peripherals and is becoming widely used by manufacture=
rs
for speeding the flow of data within servers, storage area networks and=20
network
switches. Backwards compatible with the high performance PCI local bus
specification, PCI-X offers an immediate solution to the increased I/O
requirements for high-bandwidth applications such as Gigabit Ethernet, Fibr=
e
Channel, Ultra3 SCSI and high-performance graphics. PCI-X supports 32-bit a=
nd
64-bit operations at frequencies up to 133 MHz, allowing data throughput of=
=20
over
1 Gigabyte per second.

Broadcom also offers the most complete suite of software for server=20
applications
supporting all leading operating systems. This software suite is already
undergoing extensive system-level qualification by leading server OEMs.
Broadcom's server software package includes multi-vendor fail-over, IEEE=20
802.3AD
port aggregation, Layer 3 switch-independent Smart-Load-Balancing(TM),=20
Hot-Plug
PCI, IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging, and IEEE 802.1P traffic prioritization for
Quality of Service (QoS), cable analyzer, and advanced diagnostics and cont=
rol
functions. The combined BCM5700 MAC and server software solution demonstrat=
es
superior functionality to any other Gigabit Ethernet NIC or LOM solution
commercially available today.

A complete NIC and LOM solution is achieved by combining the BCM5700 with o=
ne=20
of
Broadcom's market leading Gigabit Ethernet transceivers, which support the=
=20
three
Ethernet speeds - 10, 100, and 1000 Mbps - in a single-chip solution with
intelligent networking functions, such as cable diagnostics and auto networ=
k
detection. Having shipped over a million Gigabit Ethernet ports, Broadcom
continues to extend its leadership position in Gigabit Ethernet, with the
broadest, most advanced family of Gigabit Ethernet transceivers. Broadcom's
Gigabit Ethernet transceiver architecture is the only solution that has bee=
n
proven in actual high-volume field deployment. Furthermore, Broadcom's Giga=
bit
Ethernet transceiver architecture has completed over eighteen months of
extensive system- and device-level testing in real-world and ""worse-case""=
=20
cable
plants by hundreds of engineers in dozens of test sites worldwide.


Pricing and Availability

Broadcom's Gigabit Ethernet MAC and Phy chipset solution is available now a=

Broadcom Reports First Quarter 2001 Results

IRVINE, Calif., Apr 18, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Broadcom Corporation (Nasda=
q:
BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband
communications, today reported financial results for the first fiscal quart=
er,
ended March 31, 2001.

Gross revenue for the first quarter was $318.1 million, an increase of 66%=
=20
over
the $191.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2000 and a decrease of =
16%
from the $378.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2000. Net revenue=
=20
for
the first quarter was $310.5 million, an increase of 62% over the $191.6=20
million
reported in the first quarter of 2000 and a decrease of 9% from the $340.2
million reported in the fourth quarter of 2000. Net revenue includes the
non-cash revenue deduction of the fair value of assumed performance-based
warrants earned by certain customers.

Pro forma net income was $24.2 million, or $.09 per share (diluted). This
compares with pro forma net income of $44.9 million, or $.18 per share
(diluted), for the same quarter in 2000, and pro forma net income of $88.8
million, or $.32 per share (diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2000. Dilute=
d
earnings per share for the quarter were based on 281.0 million weighted=20
average
shares outstanding, compared to 252.6 million weighted average shares
outstanding in the first quarter of 2000 and to 274.1 million weighted aver=
age
shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Broadcom reports net income and diluted earnings per share on a pro forma=
=20
basis,
which excludes the effects of the non-cash revenue deduction related to
performance-based warrants, acquisition-related expenses, certain=20
non-recurring
settlement charges, and payroll taxes on certain stock option exercises.
Including these charges, substantially all of which were non-cash, net loss=

for
the first quarter was $356.9 million, or $1.43 per share, compared with net
income of $38.6 million, or $.15 per share (diluted), in the same quarter o=
f
2000, and with a net loss of $768.3 million, or $3.28 per share, in the fou=
rth
quarter of 2000.

During the quarter, Broadcom announced and closed its acquisition of=20
ServerWorks
Corporation, a leading supplier of high performance SystemI/O(TM) solutions=
=20
for
server and storage platforms, network appliances and workstations. Broadcom=
=20
also
completed the acquisition of Visiontech Ltd., a leading supplier of digital
video/audio MPEG-2 compression and decompression chips enabling Personal Vi=
deo
Recording (PVR) and IP video streaming for the consumer electronics market.
These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounti=
ng.

""Our first quarter results met the revised expectations that we communicate=
d=20
on
March 6th. Looking ahead, as a result of the continued weakness in the
communications sector, we have not yet seen improvement in order visibility=
=20
from
customers,"" said Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III, Broadcom's President and CEO.
""Despite the current weakness that exists in the business, we continue to b=
e
confident that our product roadmaps in both the core and emerging markets w=
ill
position us well as the economy recovers.""

During the first quarter, Broadcom introduced several significant new=20
products.
The company announced the world's first 0.13 micron CMOS Gigabit Copper
Transceiver, a four channel device on a single monolithic chip. This produc=
t
enables cost-effective, high port count Gigabit Ethernet switches and route=
rs=20
by
doubling port density and reducing size and power requirements by 50%. This
industry leading product marks the fourth generation of Gigabit transceiver
products from Broadcom.

Broadcom's new products for optical communications applications included th=
e
world's first system-on-a-chip OC-48 line card, the world's first single-ch=
ip
OC-192 CMOS transceiver, a low power and low cost OC-192 framer and the=20
world's
lowest power 10-Gigabit CMOS limiting amplifier. These product introduction=
s
position Broadcom very well in the market for broadband optical=20
communications.

Broadcom's newly acquired ServerWorks business made two noteworthy=20
announcements
during the first quarter. First, ServerWorks unveiled its new Grand=20
Champion(TM)
architecture for future Intel(R) Xeon(TM) based servers. This product is th=
e
first to support PCI-X, the new high performance input/output standard for
server and workstation platforms and the first to deliver memory bandwidth =
of
6.4 Gbytes/second or four times the company's previous solutions. In additi=
on,
ServerWorks announced new SystemI/O logic that is optimized for dense Inter=
net
network servers produced by OEM customers such as Compaq, Dell, IBM, NEC an=
d
Siemens.

During the quarter, the Home Networking Business Unit extended its industry
leading position by surpassing the two million unit milestone for total num=
ber
of units shipped. HomePNA(TM), which utilizes the phone lines already in a=
=20
home,
continues to be the most widely produced home networking technology.

Broadcom also announced, sampled, gained design wins and has begun shipping=
=20
the
world's first single-chip IP phone solution incorporating Ethernet switch
technology, dual Ethernet transceivers, DSP and RISC processor cores and=20
analog
CODECs for handset and speakerphone support. This highly integrated Etherne=
t=20
IP
phone chip enables toll-quality IP phones with the lowest power consumption=
.

Broadcom also introduced the first all-CMOS Bluetooth(TM) radio to achieve
Bluetooth qualification. This radio is designed specifically for use in mob=
ile
phone handsets and further extends Broadcom's Blutonium(TM) line of Bluetoo=
th
solutions.

Broadcom's tuner chip was the first to receive CableLabs(TM) certification =
and
EuroDOCSIS certification. This will continue to allow manufacturers to=20
utilize a
highly integrated CMOS tuner chip to replace the 200-plus discrete componen=

int's results were slightly improved as the price of oil per barrel increas=
ed to an average of $19-$21, but their asset base held steady.   At the end=
 of 2000, FieldPoint completed another acquisition that boosted assets to $=
4.5 million, and through the third quarter assets stood at $4.8 million. In=
 the meantime, revenues have jumped from $1.6 last year and are projected a=
t $2.5 million this year. As a low cost producer, FieldPoint successfully i=
ncreases production and lowers operational expenses every time they make an=
 acquisition.   Over the course of the next 36-48 months the company hopes =
to accumulate over $50 million in assets. Past performance would indicate t=
his is not an unrealistic goal. That is a tenfold increase from where the c=
ompany's assets are today. For investors, the market capitalization of the =
company should reflect the increase in assets. A $50 million dollar asset b=

sweet profits like...41% in 3 weeks with Microsoft calls...
150% in 2 months with Comex calls... And 160% in 5 weeks with
NASDAQ Internet Index calls... Or 60% on Swiss francs -- in only
6 weeks...

You could have done even better with these stock picks... 710%
in 8 months on Ballard Power, 175% in four months with Ashton
Mining. In the coming months, you'll have a chance to make even
more. Much more...""


Dear Daily Reckoning Reader,

Bluntly speaking... in the next two years more people are going
to get killed in the market than are going to make a killing.

If you've spent any time in the market, you know it has changed
dramatically since 1998... and right now it's super volatile.
The U.S. economy is vulnerable. Many investors are frightened.
They are retreating to T-bills, CDs and cash.

Frankly, for many investors... that's not a bad move.

They'll do better than the folks who stick with the index funds
and the typical mutual funds. But for those who understand what
the market is doing... where the smart money is going... what
sectors will remain strong no matter what the economy does...
have long-standing, heavy-hitting industry contacts...  and have
experience at making profits in a bear market... the next couple
of years could be the most profitable ever.

I'm writing to you today to help you join a small group of
investors who recently took advantage of a serious bottleneck in
the oil services sector to position themselves for a 90% profit
in just 15 days!  And they expect to make even more...

Another strategy they used grabbed 710% profits in seven months
on a power company... 100% in three months on a burgeoning
mining company... 376% in six months on an oil & gas pick...
175% in four months on a diamond company... and more...

You see, long before the bear started mauling the NASDAQ... it
tore up mining, oil and other real assets. Resource stocks got
killed. But that's over now. The bear has moved out.  And now
that we're seeing instability in the U.S. economy, massive
layoffs and diminishing confidence in the dollar, hard assets
are making an impressive rebound. A cursory look at the
headlines of your local paper tells the story.

Fact is, we're sitting on the cusp of a major long-term bull
move in resources and assets... with no end in sight.
Fortunately, because of the damage over the last few years --
these stocks are still at bargain prices! Experienced investors,
who get the market right and pick the winning companies, can
make more money faster in this sector than any other. All while
the average portfolio gets gutted like a house on the tail end
of a four-alarm blaze.

Last year, a well-known mining company was selling for over $17.
That company owns 50% of a rich property -- a deposit that
contains almost 20 million ounces of gold and 5 billion pounds
of copper. But right now, nobody cares. The stock is selling for
about two bucks. But get this, it has more than $2.50 of cash a
share in the bank... and that's on top of the mineral assets.

People were willing to pay $17 a year ago for a company that
didn't have the assets it now has for $2.10. Most investors
still are more interested in tech stocks with no assets.
Amazing, isn't it?  If you buy this company now -- while this
sector is on the way back up -- you get it at a discount to the
cash on hand... and they practically throw the mine in for
free.

The way I see it, you can't go wrong. If somebody wants to give
me a gold mine, I'll take it. And obviously I think that you
should too... But almost nobody is paying much attention to this
gold mine giveaway.

As usual, the Wall Street analysts ignore these tiny undervalued
gems... until they really take off.  But what do we care? We get
there first... while no one is watching. And pick up the
profits.

With mining shares now at mere fractions of their highs -- and
at even smaller fractions of what most analysts would consider
fair value -- you have a chance to reap huge returns. But -- and
this part is crucial
-- you have to get in right away... because the bull market in
natural resources is taking off now. We're seeing a long-term
bull market for natural resources ahead. Some of these stocks
will easily go up 30%... 70%... even 300% in a few weeks --
sometimes in a few days.

Extraordinary Buying Opportunities

While you may recognize me and my advisory service, Outstanding
Investments, from comments Bill Bonner has made in The Daily
Reckoning, I'm writing to tell you about an entirely different
and unique companion service I've developed... one that could be
especially valuable to you in the volatile months ahead  -- it's
called the Resource Trader Alert.

The Resource Trader Alert is an exceptional e-mail and fax
service specifically designed for investors who want to take
advantage of fast-moving opportunities... and more speculative
investments. And because they move fast and are a little
riskier... they are potentially much more profitable. Let me
give you an example.

In the early 1990s, Canada's Northwest Territories experienced a
tremendous rush of diamond explorers. Many of them were hoping
to cash in on a few ""area plays"" on the heels of an earlier
major discovery in the region. Predictably a few years later,
most of the excesses were gone. This left Resource Trader Alert
subscribers with an opportunity to buy up Ashton Mining at
bargain prices.

It began when we sent a team out to complete a technical review
of Ashton's initial exploration and discovery results in
northern Alberta. We liked what we saw. Though the company still
had a lot of drilling to do -- and a little more to prove before
we considered mentioning the stock in Outstanding Investments --
we felt comfortable enough to recommend Ashton as a speculative
buy to Resource Trader Alert subscribers at $4 a share.

Four months later, Ashton's share price topped out at over $11 a
share -- an increase of 175%!  But the key was getting in at a
good price. Taking a position in a stock at its earliest, most
speculative stage can only be accomplished with a service like
Resource Trader Alert.

Some Have Called Me A ""Teen Stock Geek""...

Not that I mind. This volatile market has thrown many investors
for a loop. Even the pros. Mutual funds have hit the toilet...
but of course many of them are run by ""27-year-old geniuses.""
These guys can't even see a bear when it bites them... and
believe me, they've been bitten.

I like to think I'm of a different breed of analyst altogether.
I was investing in the market when most kids were collecting
45's or baseball cards.  My father, C.V. Myers, was one of the
original ""gold bugs"" -- he taught me the difficult lessons of
investing -- the ones most investors never learn -- before I
even learned to drive.

On one score, I bought gold bullion at $35 an ounce. That was
back in 1971. By the time it hit $100 in 1972, I was dying to
sell. I had already tripled my investment. But dad said, ""No.""
It was a fundamental rule... you don't sell if the fundamentals
that made you money are still intact.

By the time I'd made five times my investment... the profits
were practically burning a hole in my pocket. I wanted to sell.
My $10,000 had become $50,000... a fortune at the time.
Especially for an eager young buck like me. But ol' C.V. said to
hold on... ""You never know the ultimate top of a stock until
it's past. And that means you have to sell below that peak when
the investment begins to fall.  The loss from the summit is
often a pittance compared to the gains earned during a long
ascent.""

Still, I was dying to sell at $300... $400... $500... in fact
all the way up. And by 1979, gold peaked at over $800. But
honestly, there was no way to tell whether this was the top or
not.

Like today, the U.S. economy was in a quagmire. Fed chief Paul
Volker decided it was time to shore up the weak dollar. Gold
slipped and failed to make a new high. By the time it hit $650,
my dad issued an all-out sell signal and cashed in. I used the
tidy fortune to buy a house with my fianc?e, Angie. And learned
a powerful lesson about investing: It's even more important to
know when to sell than it is when to buy.

Experience Pays Off...

In a market where most fund managers tend to be under 30 and
have never seen a bear market or recession before, I bring to
the table over 20 years of experience.  This is a definite plus
to investors who seek to turn their hard-earned dollars into
moneymaking opportunities... fast.

What's more, living across the border in Canada gives me a
unique ""insider's"" insight into the U.S. market and allows me to
keep close contacts with the companies in the natural resource
sector that is so dominant in Canada... the second benefit I
bring to readers of The Daily Reckoning... and subscribers of
the Resource Trader Alert.

In the 2001 market, I see impressive opportunities in small and
micro cap stocks -- some call them penny shares -- and also in
stock options. Both offer the aggressive investor a shot at
making big returns -- QUICKLY.

You Could Have Made $9,000 In Two Weeks

When news breaks it can make you money fast... if you know how
to play it. On Nov. 15, 2000, I issued an alert with news of the
United Nations agreeing to pay Iraq for oil in euros instead of
dollars. That, coupled with the presidential stalemate, signaled
an ""end to the greenback's hegemony over energy.""  I smelled an
opportunity to cash in on the ""weakness in the dollar.""

I offered Resource Trader Alert readers a way to harness this
trend for quick gains. I won't go into all the details here...
but simply put, readers jumped on an easy way to do a ""bull call
option spread"" with the dollar against the Swiss franc.

Don't worry if you're not an expert on options.  While this may
sound like a complicated speculation that only huge investment
houses and central bankers make, it couldn't be more
straightforward.  I've reduced it to a simple call to your
broker. But for now, all you need to know is that this picks
limited our subscribers' risk and offered possible returns of up
to 400%.  In fact, following my strategy you could have started
with as little as $750 at risk.

On Dec. 28 - just six weeks later - the jig was up. I issued a
sell alert. That day you could have closed out your option and
made $450 a pop. Ten options would have netted you $4,500 profit
-- a cool profit of 60% in just six weeks!

All you had to do was read your alert... and call your broker.
It's that simple. Of course, not everything I recommend in
Resource Trader Alert does this well.... with markets as complex
and volatile as they are today, that would be virtually
impossible. But when you subscribe to the Resource Trader Alert,
you'll get the straight skinny and opportunities you would never
hear directly from your broker.

This May NOT Be For Everyone

Of course, in order to collect the big profits, you must assume
some risk. It goes with the territory... and is simply the
nature of investing in small, speculative companies or options.
But to counter this risk I use several strategies -- and intend
to increase your profits.

For one thing, Resource Trader Alert subscribers are always
encouraged to take their original capital off the table on a
double, and let the profits ride for even higher returns. Those
gains are risk-free. I call it the ""Point of No Concern""
risk-management tool. Sell half on a double and recoup your
capital costs. And that's exactly what my subscribers have done
time and time again on stocks like Ultra Petroleum, El Misti
Gold, Western Copper, Francisco Gold and many others, including
Minefinders Corp.

When I first recommended Minefinders, the company's stock was
selling for about $2.50 per share. A little under four months
later, Resource Trader Alert subscribers received a bulletin
informing them that the share price had reached $5.60.  It more
than doubled!  And following the ""Point of No Concern""
risk-management system, our subscribers were told to take their
initial investment off the table.  For example, if you had
invested $10,000, you'd now have over $20,000. With my
risk-management system, you would have recouped your initial
$10,000, but now have another $10,000-plus to invest again.

With each Resource Trader Alert you get a detailed explanation
of the investment opportunity. You'll see precisely why a stock
or option is being recommended... precisely how much to pay for
it... and what special action -- if any -- is necessary.

Plus, you'll be posted on any changes. You'll always have
specific instructions on exactly when to take profits. Sometimes
you're going to be in and out in a week or even a couple of
days, aiming for a quick killing of 50% or 100% profits. Other
times there's a longer-term perspective. But regardless of how
long we hold a stock, the alert service will keep you posted at
all times so you're in and out of a stock at the most profitable
prices.

Is this service for you? I don't know...

The Resource Trader Alert is a service for more aggressive
investors interested in taking advantage of the current bull
market in natural resources and hard assets with higher-risk and
faster-paced opportunities.

Some investors aren't interested in paying strict attention to
their investments at this fast level of timing. That's fine. The
Resource Trader Alert is a premium service designed for
subscribers with a financial ability to invest in earlier stage
speculations. Smaller investors probably shouldn't be involved
in this kind of trading. It's definitely not the place to invest
your rent money or retirement funds.

Still, if you want to consider more speculative investments --
those subject to greater risk -- they also offer the promise of
greater rewards -- such profits as 150% on Comex calls and 710%
on Ballard Power.

Once We Reach Full Capacity -- The Door Will Close.

When we say this service is for a select group of investors, we
mean it. I'm speaking here on behalf of my publisher, too. We
have a firm policy of limiting the number of subscriptions we
accept -- to protect you. We don't want to prematurely cause a
price hike on any of the thinly-traded stocks we write about as
more and more subscribers get in. and we don't want it to fall
as we're selling.

By our calculations, allowing only 500 subscribers to join is as
close to perfect as we can get. Just enough to open the circle
up to our more speculative readers -- yet limited enough to
protect your investment interests. We expect our remaining
available invitations to Resource Trader Alert to disappear 
quickly. If you're seriously interested in making fast profits
as safely as possible, please secure your spot today.

Otherwise, we'll have to return your money and put you on the
waiting list. It could be some time before a spot comes open
again for you. And I'm sure you don't want to miss out on the
profits.   In fact, I am getting ready to issue my next
recommendation, and I want you to have every possible chance to
take advantage of it.

And you can. In fact, for only $995 per year, you can benefit
from the Resource Trader Alert. That's about $20 a week -- just
about what it might cost you for a nice dinner on the town.  And
for that low price, you get a world-class trading advisory
service with the chance to make 150%, 276%... even 710% returns
on your money.  Enough to pay for this service many times over.

You'll receive alerts when it's time to buy, sell or simply when
something happens that warrants an update. With your
subscription, you are entitled to 48 alerts -- generally sent to
you every week via e-mail or fax... your choice.

What's more, with your subscription, you'll receive a free guide
to investing safely and profitably in small and micro cap and
option plays.  In this special report, ""Raking in Huge Profits
on Penny Stocks and Options"", you'll learn the basics, including
the art of buying and selling at the right time -- and
commonly-used terms in the investment world, so you're
well-educated when executing your investments.

Remember, with the incredible investment opportunities you'll
read about in the Resource Trader Alert, you could turn $10,000
into $27,500, as some of our subscribers had the chance to do
with Ashton Mining... or in the case of Minefinders, $15,000
into $33,600.  So... simply click here:

http://www.dailyreckoning.com/Volcanic.cfm

and order online today! (Remember to tell us how you want to
receive your alerts -- e-mail or fax.) Remember, that 10-to-1
shot isn't unusual in this business. Even 100-to-1 shots do
happen. I'm talking about $100,000... even $1 million paydays.
At any day, at any moment, the next profit opportunity may come
our way... don't miss it.

Sincerely,

John Myers,
Editor, Resource Trader Alert

P.S. Profitable opportunities often arise at a moment's notice.
And when they do, as a subscriber to Resource Trader Alert,
you'll be able to take full advantage of them and realize
outstanding gains -- like the 175% we made on Ashton Mining and
710% on Ballard Power. If you want these kinds of gains, then I
urge you to sign up now to this extremely lucrative service.

P.P.S. Options and small and micro cap stocks -- or penny stocks
-- may offer investors greater profits, but they can also mean
higher risks. Your free special report, ""Raking in Huge Profits
on Penny Stocks and Options"" will introduce you to how you can
rake in the profits, with limited risk, from these picks in
natural resources and real assets. ""Raking in Huge Profits...""
is yours free when you accept this limited-time offer. Simply
click here: http://www.dailyreckoning.com/Volcanic.cfm  and
order online today! (Don't forget to tell us whether you want to
receive your alerts by e-mail or by fax.)

1215,"Westcoast, Coastal Split Engage Energy Assets

To prepare for El Paso Energy's looming takeover of Coastal Corp., Westcoast 
Energy Inc. and Coastal are splitting up Engage Energy, their three-year-old 
marketing venture, with each retaining a half interest in the Houston-based 
gas marketer. The split should be completed by the end of the week. 

Coastal, headquartered in Houston, will merge with El Paso Energy in a $16 
billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19), and 
company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed 
before the merger could be finalized, including dismantling the Engage 
venture. Vancouver-based Westcoast and Coastal each own 50% interest in 
Engage, which has 12 regional offices throughout North America and employs 
300. One of the top North American gas marketers, it purchases natural gas 
from every producing basin in North America, and trades electricity within 
all NERC regions. Engage estimates it will add another 1 Bcf/d to its natural 
gas deliverability by the end of this year. 

NGI ranked Engage in 12th place in its 1999 North American power marketers 
list, dropping from eighth place in 1998, losing about 15.2% in sales. Engage 
reported a sales volume of 5.6 Bcf/d last year, compared with 6.6 Bcf/d the 
previous year. It sold an estimated 2,100 Bcf of natural gas in 1999. 

Westcoast and Coastal formed Engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of 
energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity 
trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and 
transportation-related services, structured power and management services and 
energy risk management services. The companies said that those services would 
continue as before. There is expected to be little impact on either company's 
existing asset valuation. 

Under the restructuring plan, Westcoast will retain the Engage Canadian 
business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the United 
States. Westcoast also will retain the right to use the Engage Energy name 
and will continue to conduct business from Calgary, Southfield, MI and other 
U.S. locations. Coastal will retain the U.S. business entity, with 
headquarters in Houston. 

""By taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and 
trading functions, we can better capitalize on the knowledge, experience, 
track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three 
years,"" said Michael Phelps, Westcoast CEO. 

When Coastal merges with El Paso, it will be joining a company that already 
has a strong gas marketing arm. NGI ranked El Paso seventh on its list of gas 
marketers in 1999, noting that it traded 6.7 Bcf/d of natural gas last year. 
It also was ranked seventh in 1998.",Westcoast Michael Phelps,"$16

1217,"Breaking News: Cal-PX Shuts Down Trading 
posted 2:47 PM (CST) Jan 30, 2001 
In direct reaction to federal regulatory moves Monday, the California Power 
Exchange (Cal-PX) board decided to shut down day-ahead and day-of wholesale 
electricity markets by noon Wednesday, Jan. 31. Today will be the last day of 
trading for the day-ahead, and Wednesday the final day for the day-of, 
bringing to a close one part of the state's initial 1996 electric industry 
restructuring law that created the state-chartered, nonprofit public benefits 
corporation to provide a wholesale spot market through which California's 
three major investor-owned utilities were required to buy and sell all of 
their wholesale power. They are no longer required to do so. 
""Regrettably, Cal-PX must take this extraordinary action in response to 
Monday's FERC order that directs us to immediately comply with the terms of 
its Dec. 15 order and implement a $150/MWh breakpoint,"" said Cal-PX CEO 
George Sladoje, who noted that there is a Feb. 7 oral argument set for the 
power exchanges emergency motion and petition with the U.S. Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals, requesting a stay and rehearing of the original FERC Dec. 
15 order. 
The Cal-PX will not close down entirely as yet. It will continue to perform 
all scheduling and settlement services for its current participants. ""Forward 
contracts will be scheduled via approved alternative delivery mechanisms, 
assuring both buyers and sellers will not be inconvenienced or exposed to 
adverse economic impact as a result of the suspension of the day-ahead 
market,"" the exchange said in announcing the market closings. ",George Sladoje,150,"the California Power

1221,"News : FERC Approves Independence, SupplyLink Projects 
2:00 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000
 
After submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent 
agreements 
for firm transportation capacity, the highly contested Independence Pipeline 
and related 
SupplyLink pipeline projects were approved by FERC this morning. The two 
projects 
have been pending at FERC for more than three years.

The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas 
transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in 
Pennsylvania. 
The ""tentative"" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their 
downstream 
partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be 
operating 
a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and 
National 
Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an 
investment 
of about $1.5 billion.

The Commission approved the ""greenfield"" Independence project over 
significant 
opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they 
were not 
convinced the new precedent agreements provided ""sufficient evidence"" of 
market 
support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at 
least 35% 
of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26.

As a cautionary move, Enron OnLine was interrupted while the extent of the 
failure was assessed, resulting in the system being unavailable from 11:23 to 
11:39.  All Enron Building telephones and voicemail were unavailable for 
approximately one hour and 20 minutes and certain ENA trading systems were 
unavailable for over two hours.  During this time the power was stabilized 
and systems were restored.  Immediate steps are being taken to correct this

Sithe's P&L.

1.  Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this 
revenue in the P&L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction 
in the current P&L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe 
Power QP7914.2.  Please settle this with January's physical purchase.
2.  Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a 
financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's 
invoices.
3.  We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in  Schedule B in the 
FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&L limitations, we will be 
modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this).  A financial 
annuity was then written between Sithe and Ontario to recognize the schedule 
B item in the sithe book and keep Ontario flat(TAGG#QP7914.3).
4.  The final $550,919 was then granted out to you via origination from the 
FT-Ontario book(same reasons as above) and an annuity was then written to the 
FT-Ontario book to keep it flat.(TAGG#QP7914.4).

These four deals in TAGG will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish 
the goals of your email below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please 
feel free to contact me at 3-7376.  Thanks.

1269,"I spoke with Wayne Duman last Thursday (9/21/00) to schedule a Enron VEPCO 
meeting for September 29, 2000 to discuss VEPCO progress with the Facility 
Study and processing/negotiating the Interconnect Agreement.  Wayne cancelled 
that meeting later that same afternoon.  I spoke with him today in regarding 
the reasons for cancellation.  

As it turns out, his group--Bulk Power Delivery--is not the group executing 
the PPA with Enron.  That group is Tim Talmadge's group--Capacity 
Acquisition.  Once Wayne tried to schedule the 9/29 meeting, he was told not 
to talk with Enron.  Further investigation on his part uncovered some 
internal VEPCO issues.  He is calling an internal meeting with Capacity 
Acquisition, Bulk Power Delivery, Bulk Power Operations and the Transmission 
Group to discuss these issues and establish a consistent ""game plan"" for 
going forward.

The Transmission Group is scheduled to finish the Facility Study on Monday, 
October 2, 2000.  The study will include switchyard needs, network needs, 
construction costs, and construction schedule.  He knows we have a June 2001 
commercial operation date, and he knows that Capacity Acquisition is 
responsible for the associated construction costs.  He is nervous that the 
Facility Study will forecast construction schedules that do not coincide with 
the commercial operation date.  He further indicated that acquisition of 
necessary equipment--breakers, transformers, etc. specified by the Facility 
Study--could be a significant challenge for VEPCO.  He understands that this 
is his challenge, not ours.  He also noted that VEPCO is very sensitive and 
careful to operate within FERC guidelines regarding interconnection and the 
various time frames--this includes not making any special considerations to 
the Capacity Acquisition guys since they are in the same company.

Wayne Duman is very involved in VEPCO's effort to develop an Interconnection 
Agreement consistent with FERC.  They are within days of completing this 
task--it is in legal review right now.  The current  version of the 
Interconnection Agreement is a subsequent generation of the document we 
reviewed at the beginning of August.  Wayne understands that the PPA which 
VEPCO and Enron are negotiating is contardictory to the ""boiler plate"" 
Interconnection Agreement and needs to be changed to reflect the PPA defined 
scopes for Enron and VEPCO.  He indicated that part of VEPCO's ""to do list"" 
to get ready to meet with Enron includes modification of the latest 
generation of the VEPCO Interconnection Agreement to be consistent with the 
Enron PPA.

He is optimistic that we would be able to meet late next week to get the 
Interconnect Agreement process underway.  He assured me that he would keep 
Enron informed of the progress.

In summary, VEPCO is doing the following:
getting all stakeholders on the same page,
finishing the Facility Study, and
getting their Interconnection Agreement to agree with the PPA.

       I spoke with Martha today on the subject referred to above and she
advised me of the following :  
      1.   DEP is not contemplating a single, consolidated permit but an air
permit  for each of the Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach facilities.   
       2.   The petitioning local governments have no objection to the
consolidation proposed by DEP (no surprises there).   
        3.   Martha wants our input as to which ALJ we would prefer to hear
the case should DEP's request for consolidation be granted.   (  The upside
to suggesting Judge Alexander is that we know that he have already reserved
his time for a 4-day hearing in January.  Otherwise, we might choose Judge
Stampelos based upon the prior comments that we have received from our
Tallahassee attorneys, although both Judges were considered to be good.).   
          4. Martha indicated previously that she is looking for a hearing
in January, depending upon which ALJ hears the case and his particular
schedule. 
          5.  Martha advised me that she will file her request for
consolidation late tomorrow afternoon.  I told her, as we discussed in our
conference call, that if she does not hear from me to the contrary, then we
oppose the consolidation at this time.   
          6.  Martha agreed to provide us with the permit language that DEP
is proposing in connection with its Notice of Change of Agency Position  on
the Pompano Beach proceeding as soon as Al Linero completes the drafting and
she reviews the proposed permit conditions with him.  Martha expects to
provide us with the proposed permit language next  Monday or Tuesday. 
          7.  The petitioning local governments have served DEP with
discovery.  I have yet to receive a copy of the discovery but Martha intends
to meet with Al Linero this Friday to discuss  DEP's response. 
          Based upon the foregoing, please advise me if you want me to
convey any further message to Martha prior to her filing of the motion for
consolidation tomorrow afternoon.  Specifically, I am interested in your
thoughts on our preference on the Judge that will hear the proceeding, if
consolidated, and whether we have any objection to DEP's filing the motion
for consolidation in which she will note our objection.  As we discussed in
our conference call, we can assert our position more fully in a subsequent
response to the motion for consolidation and can withdraw our objection if
we change our mind.     
         Thanks !  Kerri

The unit deliveries that go with revised milestone 10 are units # 21&22 that
actually occur by March 30, 2001.  I've already pushed back payments as far
as I can for Units 19,20, 23, & 24, by splitting the 10% into two 5%
payments from the earlier agreed to 2/15 date.  So the deferral of 5% of
contract to 7/30/01 more than accomodates the later ship dates.  The value
for delaying ~ $ 17.5 mm for 75 days is already benefitting by $ 365,000

1286,"Hi Carolyn,

Here are my intial comments on the letter agreement and LLC:

1.  Will there be a second set of documents for the LLC getting the 
transformer as well as the turbine?

2.  Tax liability - I think we should broaden the tax section to offload 
responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the 
equipment, not just the sale.  I believe this should be a TEH responsibility.

3.  Terminology - Breakout contract should be Facility Agreement, and 
commercial operations should be as defined in the Facility Agreement (a 
reference is fine).

4.  Confidentiality - any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the 
confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement?  If fact, please review 
the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss 
same.

5.  Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here.  We should 
specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity, or guaranteed 
by a credit worthy entity.  

6.  Timing of delivery of contract and funding -  in discussing this matter 
with our commercial lead, Ben Jacoby, he indicated that he believed that the 
obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility 
agreement, or stated another way, a condition precedent to the obligation to 
fund as opposed to existing (as a signed document) as of the time of signing.

7.  Reps - as we discussed, Enron should rep that it has the ability to 
convey the equipment, or other such language, as opposed to getting into the 
nitty gritty of our financing structure.

I'm still reviewing and collecting comments, but this gives you an idea of 
where we are headed.

approach was generally acceptable, and Delta/Hancock are to send a letter 
agreement concerning this approach.  This has not yet been received.  This 
prevents the establishment of the escrow account.  We have sent the escrow 
agreement to the bank, but Delta has not completely signed off on the 
agreement.  

2. GE turbine contract.  Delta sent requested changes yesterday, and these 
were forwarded to GE.  I have not received a response from GE.

3.  Miscellaneous docs.  Enron has responded to all the documents requested 
by Hancock.  We are awaiting responses to our drafts. 

4.  GE consent.  Hancock requested some changes to the current draft, and a 
new letter agreement.  GE hasn't responded to the requests yet.  GE has dealt 
directly with Freshfields, so it is possible that there are discussions we 
aren't involved in.

I've left Lee a message concernig the GE items and the timing of signing.

Carolyn, please correct/add anything you think is important.

Do you have the standard offer service agreement?  It isn't in Stuart's file,

your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business

1400,"Danny,

I met with Phil Lowry, Jerry Martin, John Keller, and Kevin Hyatt to discuss the revised cost estimates for Sun Devil.  My blood pressure has eased somewhat.  I'm hopeful that the estimate will be revised downward to a level more consistent with the original by the end of the week.  The engineers want to make this project work and have taken some actions away to further squeeze the cost bundle.
  
Here's a quick recap-

$580 MM was the Total Project Excl. Int., O/H, etc. used for the open season.
$667 MM was the Total Project Incl. Int., O/H, etc used for the open season.
$912 MM is the latest Total Project Incl. Int, O/H, etc

The difference between $912 MM and $667 MM is $245 MM.  

Of this, $218 MM relates to-

-$65 MM for the Panda lateral (not in original scope)
-[$44] MM for 36"" pipe vs 30"" pipe (not in original scope).  This amount to be confirmed by the engineers.
-$48 MM for escalation (not broken out per se in the original scope)
-$33.2 MM additional cost for Navajo land acquisition
-$13.2 MM additional cost for Navajo labor on Navajo lands (not included in original estimate)
-$14.5 MM additional cost for gross receipts tax (not accounted for in the original scope)

We can reduce the estimate by $109 MM just by returning to the original project scope.  Panda will have to pay for the lateral to their plant.  We won't overbuild with 36"" pipe to provide hourly swing capability unless shippers pay a higher rate (or we are content to hold excess capacity for future shippers). Some additional savings will accrue as a result of reducing the amount of compression (California shippers have shown no interest in paying anything close to full rate).  Finally, the engineers haven't given up on finding other potential savings.

The remaining $109 MM comes under the category of ""identified risks"".  Estimates are provided in current dollars and the ""escalation"" component highlights the risk of inflation.  The reality is that ETS has had very little recent experience pricing pipelines in the southwest.  The additional costs for Navajo land and labor can only be bottomed out through bilateral discussions with the Navajos.  I'm still checking the gross receipts tax cost - - - seems that it was not included in the original estimate, which is a bust.

1401,"Stan,

In October we had a plan to purchase 0.5 Bcf of gas that was projected to bring our operational storage level to 12 Bcf by the end of the month and were concerned about over-filling our storage fields from potential long gas by shippers.  In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the system by 1.7 Bcf month-to-date.  Our original plan, based on a combination of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows:

Ending October Balance		12 Bcf
Ending November Balance		13 Bcf
Ending December Balance		14 Bcf

To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in November of at least 2.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of the month).  We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in November that should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf.  We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level.  Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week) for November.

     I've been holding Babiuk off.  But this is starting to sound like vintage Ballentine, and I have some doubt that he has any real deal in store.  Can we sell him an option for $50,000, to accept this deal by execution of our document and payment of the consideration by November 15, 2001?  It would show that he's, at least, serious.  Or we could break off discussions with him all together and start up with El Paso.  What do you think?

Mike Brown, David Terlip, Janice Moore and I met today.  Plan is for Mike to 
get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.  If Siemens 
amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's 
spec to us.  Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens.   
If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy.  
This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo 
""off spec"" demand separate test using ""ashing"" technique (more likely to 
pass) and if it passes using ""ashing"" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute 
over acceptance of ""ashing"" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected 
(either because First Gas refuses to accept ""ashing"" or because off spec even 
with ""ashing"") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative 
supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a 
possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.  
This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on 
spec.

Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a 
status report.

As there has been significant changes at Enron over the last few months, I
wanted to revisit employment opportunities at Enron.  With change comes
opportunity and I hope both of you have been able to adequately capitalize.

My resume has been updated to reflect the work I have completed this year.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

This is  a new day and time for this meeting.  Thank you and I apologize for any inconvenience.

Background:  A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would have implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms.

Often times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the trade date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins to question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9/01/01 to 9/30/01.

Request Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not just for a different month?

Thank you in advance.

In an effort to clean up RisktRAC, we have created a new hierarchy structure in RisktRAC that is currently in the testing phases.  I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the new hierarchy structure for Financial Gas (please look at all the tabs).  Also included is a list of your books that are linked to the lowest level portfolio of the hierarchy structure.

Additionally, could you please review the ""books"" tab and ensure that the book list is complete and accurate and that the book is linked to the correct trader (please note - if more than one trader trades out of the same book, the book should be assigned to the most senior trader.  Please ensure that this has been done correctly).  Please advise us of any missing books as well.

So nice to hear from you, I'm glad we';ve got this e-mail business figured 
out.  Hope your day is going well.  Sometime, please tell me what ""A Day in 
the Life of Rev. Jackson"" is like at SWCBC.  Do you see alot of people all 
day long (during the day)?  So often, it's hard to picture the church as 
being active all day long.  It just seems like people attend meetings and 
services about twice a week in the evenings.  Funny, how we get perceptions 
in our heads.

My day is going pretty good so far, I'm back to making money in my ""book"" 
here at work and it sure feels good.  I've always remembered what you told me 
during my ""crisis period"" and always keep those things in mind.  The one that 
I like the best is ""Just keep your mind stayed on him, He'll keep you in 
perfect peace"".  I take that with me everywhere I go.

1460,"Hi Jewel,

Sorry, I was not available to visit with you when you called the other day, 
but things have been extremely busy around here, and plus, there is very 
little room for privacy.

In answer to your question, there are no special requirements.  Back in the 
day, they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience, 
but anymore, the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low, that they will 
consider most people, with an analytical or coordinative type background.  I 
think it's one of those things that once you ""get your foot in the door"", you 
can move on from there.

Just be aware, that if you were to become a gas scheduler, it may require 
working on weekends, and late nights from time to time.

As far as the next step, I would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail 
to George Smith, Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk, and ask him if he 
has time to visit with you.  I think that by simply expressing an interest, 
and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler, and also, learning 
what you can expect to learn from him, should serve as the first step.   
Also, if he is interested, and does not have a position currently open, then 
he will pass on your name to some of the other managers.  They're actually 
pretty good about that!  I'll mention to George that you may give him a call.

Let me know if you have any further questions, or want to visit some more!

Take care!

provider.  Your request has been received and it is currently being processed.
A customer service professional will be in contact with you within 48 hours.
While you wait, here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions.

Q. If I am already a Road Runner customer what will happen to my account?

A. Your account will be transitioned to the new Enron billing system.  This
process is transparent to the end user.  The difference will be seen in your
monthly bill.  Keep in mind that there may still be prorated amount due on the
previous billing method.  Also, an account that is currently delinquent cannot
be transferred until the previous balance is paid in full.

Q. I?m not currently a Road Runner customer.  What is the process?

A. Your address will be checked to verify Road Runner serviceability.  If
serviceable, a customer service professional will contact you to set up an
appointment for a new install.  There are typically two time slot options a
customer may choose, 8am ? 12 noon or 1pm ? 5pm.

Q. Are there any installation charges?

A. All Enron customers will be charged a fee of $39.95 for a standard install
(network interface card not included).  Keep in mind that if you are getting
your computer through the Click at Home project, a network interface card is
already included.  A standard install is one that only required the installer 
to
run the cable to an outside wall.  There are extra fees for a network 
interface
card and running the cable between an inside wall.

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.

Let me just bring everyone up to speed on the det's of Saturday's super-def
throwdown jam:

Start time:  8 bells
Seating:  Limited
Booze available:  Cheap beer and select liquors from my personal stock
Dress code:  Shabby Sheik aka GeoWear
Address:  2735 Steel Street

So in review, if you have lawnchairs you might want to bring some along for
yard overflow seating.  As for the sauce, if you prefer a certain gourmet
beer bring it with you cause you aint gettin' it here.  Liquor and wine is
always welcomed.  The location is just down the street from Carrie Nolan's
for those of you who have been to parties at her place--those of you that
haven't, first of all your lucky, and secondly, here's where we're at:  One
street north of Alabama, west of Kirby Drive (Directly west of the Whole
foods).  The street has a canopy of trees and is lined with apartments,
were at the west end of the apartment complex, just look for the jugglers
and mimes performing outside.

Look forward to seeing all of you, at least as long as I can see.

Cheers,
Ryan

1490,"Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.",,an additional of $1 billion,Standard & Poor's S&P Enron BBB EnronOnline

Whatup Dog?  How is Enron treating you?  Still enjoying the legal side of
things?

Everything here is going well.  Marriage is still very good, even blissful.
Michigan has been great so far but I am still waiting for the weather to
turn.  I am not jazzed about the winters here.

I have been keeping of with the horns (of course) a little from up here.
The UNC game was televised here and I think UofH is on ESPN2, I just don't
know whether it is regional or not.  I agree with you on the analysis.  We
are strong on defense and special teams (surprisingly so on special teams),
but I still worry about our DTs.  Offense is stagnant and I continue to wait
for them to get on the same page.  We have soooooo much potential there.

I haven't been to a Michigan game yet.  We missed Miami Ohio and I don't
think Lyd and I are going to got to the Eastern Michigan game this weekend.
We will certainly be going to the Big 10 games though.

Let me know how things are going when you have a chance.  Ironically, I am
busier now then I think I ever was at Enron.  I feel like I am constantly
behind the curve.

Talk to you soon.

Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Today is my grandmother's birthday......she would have been 92. Today is a
day to celebrate a woman's life who brought MUCH joy and love to me and many
others. She was there for me as a child .... to hold me, protect me, love
me. Over the years we tokk many long walks around the block in Leisure
World, watched jeopardy, wheel of fortune  and the evening news while
sipping on perfect Manhattans and having dinner, discussed golf and her
clubs and my new game, chatted about football, politics, and life til wee
hours....and then arose to read the headlines and drink coffee to chat all
over again. I will miss spending holidays with her, hanging out with her,
and being with her. She is the most positive woman I have ever known. She
always had a smile and good things to say. She brought such joy!! I will
miss her, her smile, and her answer of ""I know"" whenever I would tell her I
loved her. What a great long life she had.

Please keep my family in your prayers and let those around you ""know"" your
love in honor of my grandma, Margaret Gress.",tokk Manhattans Margaret Gress,,"Leisure

I'm pretty sure that the commissions are included on statements and charge to us daily.  Therefore, the numbers that we are confirming as either excess or margin call, is inclusive of the fees.  I believe Jason Fisher would have the exact amount of the fees.  I know this question has been proposed several times and I've always refered them directly to Jason, and I'm assuming that he was able to help as I never heard back from anyone.
 
I hope I'm leading you in the correct direction.  If not, please let me know so that I too may be aware.

1603,"yah, i'm looking forward to yoga.  i didn't do anything over break and was really looking forward to starting up my practice again and went several times as soon as i got back, but then i got sick, so ... i may try to take a nap this afternoon before yoga.  i'm very bad with directions.  i have the address at home and can call you with it, but basically, i go east on 12th Ave, turn right on (i think) 8th Street and then turn left on (i think) 24th Ave (there's an asian restaurant at this corner) and then it's up on the right side.  there's a big block of warehouse buildings.  it's a little complicated to find from here actually, maybe you should pick me up and we can go together?  

i don't really shop for ""yoga clothes"" partly out of some sort of philosophical resistance and also because the women's stuff is so much cooler than men's stuff that i don't want to bother.

i got back yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.

we expect to be reporting positions in this book?  Finally, who is the trader 
for this book?

Thanks for your help.

Below is the new capacity pricing (improved by $0.1/kw-mo) based off of

get better pricing. There is still a room between mid curve and bid curve.

Here is a brief summary of the TVA/EPMI lawsuit - Let me know if you would 
like more information 

(Note - the MOPA has been filed under seal in order to protect 
confidentiality  - The judge was sensitive about this given the potential 
right of a party to get the MOPA from TVA under a FOIA - Accordingly, we 
don't want to encourage further invetigation of the MOPA by third parties)



*EPMI filed a declaratory judgement proceeding on November 15, 1999 against 
TVA in the District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  Judge Edgar 
has been assigned the matter.

*The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA 
entered into on December 6, 1995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA).

*The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of 
TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to 
schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at 
the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at 
the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.  EPMI believes 
that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue.  

*A trial date in late June 2000 has been set.

*EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.

The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Tuesday, November 13 and Wednesday, November 14, 2001:  +1

We are finding new footing after a time of  floundering in quicksand.    The solidification of the sense that there is not going to be a quick recovery,  high level remarks about keeping Enron's trading talent intact, and encounters with counterparties like Seattle and Snohomish who seem to take a kind of nonplussed (clueless?) view of the whole situation, all suggest that the storm may be over and we are going to be able to gird up for a long steady march to a different promised land,  Houston toxins notwithstanding.  

In the morning, the crow community seemed harassed by the strong winds and were seen heading up river in a southerly direction, while the afternoon provided a view of a large raptor, some kind of hawk, or perhaps an osprey, circling high above the city's downtown core.

	West advised that she had transmitted this request to Underwriters with her recommendation that it be granted.  West anticipates an answer by this Friday.  West will be largely out of town on vacation between Christmas and the New Year, and volunteered that she did not want to be bothered with responding to lawsuits during the few days she would be in the office.

1725," As you might recall from the monthly litigation reports, Enron America del 
Sur has been involved in an ongoing dispute with Central Piedra Buena (""CPB"") 
relating to approximately $3.3 million that Enron claims it is owed pursuant 
to a 1999 natural gas sales agreement. 
  More specifically, pursuant to the sales agreement, Enron was to sell 
natural gas to CPB.  Enron bought this gas from a gas distribution company 
called Total.  The sales agreement and the purchase agreement contained 
similar provisions and Enron acted primarily as a middleman in the 
transactions. 
 Beginning in December 1999, after a change in CPB's management, CPB stopped 
paying Enron for the gas that was supplied.  As a basis for non-payment, CPB 
claimed that Enron had made numerous mistakes in calculating what was due 
from CPB.  CPB also made vague allegations of wrongdoing on Enron's part. The 
parties (including Total) have been negotiating for months in an effort to 
resolve their disputes; however, these negotiations have been unsuccessful.
 We would like approval to initiate an arbitration against CPB for the money 
they owe us which, in turn, we owe to Total. Although we believe that CPB may 
have set-off rights for a very small amount of the sums claimed, their 
failure to make any reasonable offer to resolve this matter has necessitated 
that we resort to arbitration.
   Guido Tawil of the Bomchil firm has been helping us in our efforts to 
negotiate a settlement and would represent Enron in the arbitration.  
Pursuant to the parties' agreement, this would be an ICC arbitration, would 
occur in Buenos Aires and Argentine law would apply. Additionally, several 
arbitrators have been interviewed and, in Guido's opinion, our best choice is 
Sergio La Pera, a commercial law specialist who has a good bit of experience 
as an arbitrator.  According to Guido, Mr. La Pera is available and wiling to 
serve on the arbitration panel.
 Should you need any additional information or have any questions, please let 
me know.  Thanks.

Mark and I talked about when to come to Houston.

The ideal would be for the 3 of us (Mark, Linda, Anna) to fly down late
morning on Sat. the 30th.  Ben would need a late afternoon flight on Monday
July 2nd,(he is suppose to pull in from the bus at noon, so late afternoon
would give him some buffer time).  All 4 of us could fly back on Sunday July
8th, late morning or what ever is available.  We are flexible.

Thanks a bunch!!!!

I'm sorry I never got in touch with you last weekend, but I had the wrong 
phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using 
Information.  I don't think I would have been much fun anyway since I pretty 
much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend.  In fact, I fell asleep in the 
car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents 
decided to just leave me in the car.  I think I was probably out there for an 
hour before I woke up (needless to say I was very confused).  Anyway, hope 
things are going well for you and Clay.  I know everything must be kind of 
crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the 
interviewing you've both no doubt been doing. 

I really want to get a chance to see you and chat...I don't feel like we've 
had a good one in forever.  I will be in Austin over Thanksgiving for the 
game, so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town.  If 
not, I'm sure I can manage at least one weekend trip during December if 
there's a good weekend for you.  Just drop me  a line when you get a chance 
and let me know what's new with you.

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/philosophy.gif

PHILOSOPHY
        My fondness for ambiguity in language and its graphic
representation hurtles me headlong into the hallways of heady philosophy.
Like ambiguity, philosophy tends to scare a lot of people, and it does so
for the same reason. Maintaining a single point of view on an issue is
often the easiest path, but it is not consistent with a philosophical
spirit. After all, ""philosophy"" is derived from Greek words meaning, ""the
love of wisdom"" not ""stubborn entrenchment."" In fact, if one loves wisdom
and searches after truth, then one is required to look at things from more
than one point of view.

This week's theme: words with ambigrams.

and I
went home for Thanksgiving.  It was our first time back home since the 
wedding.
It was kinda strange because since we live nearby each other, we had to decide
whos house we were going to stay at and when.  Oh the joys of being married 
and
having to split your time between the families!  It was good to see his mom
because we hadn't seen her since she started her chemo treatments.  She's 
doing
well - she's pretty much lost all of her hair, but she is now getting some of
her strength back.  She goes back to Houston next week for her fourth 
treatment
and they'll do a sonogram to see how the tumor is doing.  She will most likely
have a mastectomy in the next few months, and then we'll just go from there.
We also drove up to Austin last Thursday night for the game of Friday - GO
HORNS!!  What a fun game that was!  I had been debating on whether or not I 
was
going to go because I had surgery the Thursday before (tonsillectomy - YUK!!)
It was hard to not be able to scream after we scored touchdown after 
touchdown!!
I saw a lot of our pledge sisters at the game - Lindsay, Erica, Stacey, etc. I
was kinda out of it, though, because I was on a lot of pain medication, so 
they
probably thought I was nuts!

1772,"I talked w/ Ed McMichael about Noble WRT rescinding our termination if Noble were willing to pay in full all amounts due.  Ed said he would rather cause the position to be terminated (moving the approximately $40M MTM value out of the ""live"" status) than he would collect the $39M of outstanding invoices.  Ed's rationale is that any amounts settled (invoiced) will ultimately be collected in full w/ interest so there's no need to continue to wear the $40M MTM risk.

Therefore, I will let our termination letter stand as issued and do not plan to contact Noble.

Susan: please be sure to note that the termination letter was sent 3/11/02.

Sara has asked me to follow-up regarding the captioned Enron Affiliate and 
the need to confirm a trade.

Being that this Enron affiliate does not appear in the Corporate Database I 
was hoping  you could furnish details regarding this Enron Affiliate, as 
follows:

1. When was the company incorporated??? 
2. Where was it incorporated???
3 Or did we acquire an existing company by virtue of an acquisition???
4. What is the date of the FX trade, for which this Enron Affiliate is a 
party???
5. If this is a newly formed Enron Affiliate was the date of the FX trade 
dated simultaneous with the company's incorporation???
6. For notice purposes under the ISDA -- would we use the following??? 
    
    Bay Wellington Tower - BCE Place
    181 Bay Street, Suite 1540
    Toronto, Ontario M5J 2T3
7. If the foregoing address for notice is sufficient -- please advise as to: 
(a)  whom's attention, (b) phone number, and (c) fax number.

In discussing this matter with Sara, we have determined it would be a cleaner 
transaction if the FX trade could be confirmed under an RMT master rather 
than doing a Deemed ISDA confirmation.  Therefore, once you furnish the 
foregoing information Sara and I will be able to decide what path to take in 
order to consummate this FX trade.

Thanks for the help.

1843,"Attached is a first draft of a response to Greenpeace's April 5 letter to 
Jeff Skilling asking for Enron's answers to some specific questions on the 
Kyoto Protocol and climate change.   Similar letters were delivered by 
Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK, 
Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium.

I have attached a copy of one of the letters below.  All the questions are 
the same in each.

I have drafted a response with the goals of:

1)  Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without 
""greenwashing.""   We have an already-published public ""statement"" on climate 
change and a very positive, solution-oriented story to tell, with many facts 
and accomplishments to back up our statements.   I think our letter can land 
in the stack that they consider ""positive"" responses, and not in the stack of 
non-responses or ""we don't care"" responses.

2)  Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about ""Kyoto."" 
  I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful 
answers to the general themes of the letter.   I have discussed this with 
many of you already, but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down 
into debates over what we like/dislike, support/oppose about Kyoto....we'll 
quickly get into questions we can't now answer, and may never be able to 
answer.   I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look 
solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be 
engaged in this important issue.

3)  Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple 
applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script 
to use in their efforts; responding to shareholder inquiries and annual 
meeting Q&A;  Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations; 
something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report.  

Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive 
issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we 
need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can 
understand and use.  With that said, I also believe that these messages 
should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying 
too far from the basics can be dangerous.  We should designate one or two 
clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by 
press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our 
response letter.

There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices, 
using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds 
in the local areas.   I am not opposed to doing so, but would again 
appreciate being able to review these responses before they go.  Please let 
me know if you have other views.

I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23 
if we can turn it around that fast.  Thank you for your input and assistance 
and I look forward to your reply.

Ray Alvarez brought to my attention today a news item indicating that the Congressional Budget Office released a report earlier this week entitled ""Causes and Lessons of the California Electricity Crisis.""  The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO's web site at www.cbo.gov.  I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable.  For example, the summary says:

""Much of the blame for California's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan -- but not to its objective, electricity deregulation. (...)  But deregulation itself did not fail; rather, it was never achieved.""

""The restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work -- in part because it was not designed to.""

""Even without restructuring, California's electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000.""

""Consequently, wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market.""

""Long-term solutions to California's electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity, eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system, and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market.""

On the negative side, the report summary does state that ""some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more"" and ""the plan's auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale prices.""

We have had a pretty eventful few days:

1. EFET-Deutschland has formally been founded and also announced its withdrawl from the Gas VV negotiations. This has caused a lot of concern in the market and there are discussions (by VIK and BGW!) about getting EFET back in as the 5th Verband - something we have tried for 1 year to achieve but w/o success.  The BMWi has also contacted me and is eager that EFET and Enron stay engaged in the process, even informally if necessary. My sense is that our leverage in the German market is building (slowly). If any of you get any calls from clients or market participants on the issue of EFET's withdrawl from the Gas VV,  please let me know. 

2. More importantly, EFET-D presented yesterday at the Bundestag Anhoerung to the EnWG Novelle (Spicker delivered). On balance, the Anhoerung went very well in three important respects which I think reflect the work of many months of political pressure on the Government and the incumbents:

	1. There was signficant critique of the ENWG-Novelle and the lack of competition in the market/incumbent behaviour and the message came through loud and clear to the Bundestag and the Committee that things must change.

	2. The EU, EFET-D and other newcomer associations were asked by the Wirtschaftsausschuss to comment much more frequently than the incumbent associations. This suggests that the Bundestag is very concerned about the direction things are taking in the German energy and wants the views of the newcomers as they undertake a thorough review of things.

	3. There is serious consideration by the Bundestag going on now of important possible changes in the EnWG including Sofortvollzug of Bkart decisions & Beweisslastumkehr, much deeper unbundling of networks, getting rid of reciprocity, complete and rapid publication of network terms, and possible ex ante approval of network access conditions. 

	4. We will be meeting with a number of MdBs and BMWi staff over the next two weeks to discuss our specific proposals for changes to the EnWG and try to get them in before the Endberatung on the 17the of October.

The attached memo from Pfletschinger summarises how things went. Also check out the FAZ article from today. If any of you are interested in our EFET-D testimony delivered to the Bundestag (it is long!), let me know and I will provide you with a copy.

Fazit: My sense is that the tide is turning and I am cautiously optimistic that we should seek some important improvements in the German energy law that should have a positive impact on our business in 2002.

I understand from Ann that you are looking put some subscriptions in place 
for European publications to help you  keep abreast of what's going on over 
here.  I'm preparing a full list of all the English-speaking trade journals 
for your perusal, but in the meantime I thought I'd make a few suggestion of 
how we can help you with this task.

1.  In my view, some of the most accurate and insightful coverage comes from 
the FT Energy special publications unit.  They cover the whole of Europe 
through a number of different titles.  Enron Europe has an online group 
subscription to this series so I am arranging for you to receive a password 
so you can access this site.  Most of the publications come out twice a month.

2.  My group is responsible for media monitoring in Europe.   The material 
comes from a variety of sources and it is quite a challenge to process and 
distribute it effectively.   I suggest that we put you on the distribution 
list for all material that either specifically mentions Enron or that relates 
to regulatory matters in Europe.  

3.  We have a number of different PR companies working for us in our markets 
around Europe and they generally provide media monitoring as well but this is 
not normally translated into English unless there is something significant.  
I suggest that we include you in the circulation for those pieces.

 We also cover Japan, Australia and the Middle East from here.

Japan.   I guess Nick O'Day will send material to you direct.  We have a 
daily translation service of headlines and significant longer pieces from our 
PR agency in Tokyo.
Australia.  I will send you what we get, but things are fairly quiet there at 
present.  I know that Mark Schroeder was in dialogue with Paul Quilkey about 
the status of Government Affairs but I don't believe the issue was resolved.  
I would like to talk to you separately about this issue at some point, if you 
have a minute.
Middle East.  I am still trying to get on the circulation list for media 
coverage as we effect the transition from John Ambler's group.  I plan to 
talk to John about this when he surfaces from handling DPC issues next week.  
In my experience, the key publication for this area is MEED - the Middle East 
Energy Digest.

4.   I will send you a full list of English-speaking trades and highlight the 
ones which I think you will find most useful.   I believe quite a few of them 
are now available online.

Please let me know if I can help with anything else and perhaps we can get 
together for lunch on your next visit.

RE:  Denmark Approves Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol
DATE: May 30, 2001
______________________________________________________________________________
_________
Yesterday, the Danish Parliament passed a resolution approving the Kyoto 
Protocol, allowing Denmark to ratify the treaty jointly with other EU member 
states.  Denmark is the first EU member to take such strong government action 
related to ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.  Currently, Romania is the 
only industrialized nation to have ratified the treaty.  
While Denmark's action is largely symbolic, it puts pressure on the U.S. and 
other EU members to keep the international negotiations on track and puts 
mild pressure on other EU members to approve the treaty in preparation for 
joint ratification.
Please see Dow Jones article below.
Background
The Bush Administration is currently reviewing U.S. climate change policy 
with the aim of releasing an alternative approach to the Kyoto Protocol in 
late June.  The international climate change negotiations are scheduled to 
resume in mid-July in Bonn, Germany, but could be postponed based on the 
substance of the U.S. plan or a lack of progress during informal Ministerial 
meetings in late June.  
EU Ministers have publicly endorsed a EU ratification strategy by 2002; 
however, U.S. opposition to the treaty could delay or shift this approach.
Environmental Strategies is providing input to the Bush Administration and 
Congress on cost-effective, market-based approaches to address climate change.
Remarks by Danish Energy Minister
Danish Energy Minister Svend Auken made these remarks about ratification:
""Denmark is sending a strong signal that we still support the Kyoto Protocol, 
affirming our active contribution to protecting the environment we live in.""
""It is even more important in light of the American rejection,"" he continued, 
""for countries that support the Kyoto Protocol to show clearly that the Kyoto 
process is continuing."" 
I will keep you posted on new developments.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions.
Please see the Dow Jones article and link to the Agence France-Presse story 
below  (in French).

Denmark Approves Ratification Of Kyoto Climate Treaty

05/30/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

COPENHAGEN (AP)--The Danish parliament has approved the 1997 Kyoto
global warming treaty in a move the environment minister called a strong
signal to the U.S. administration that the ratification process will
continue despite rejection by President George W. Bush.

In an 88-9 vote late Tuesday, the parliament in Copenhagen gave its
go-ahead for European Union member Denmark to ratify the protocol when
all 15 E.U. members jointly will sign the document. No date for the
common ratification has been set.

""In light of the American government's rejection of the Kyoto agreement,
it's even more important that the countries that support it clearly
demonstrate that the Kyoto process continues,"" Environment Minister
Svend Auken said Wednesday by telephone.

The U.S. has been heavily criticized for its environmental policies
after Bush rejected the Kyoto treaty in March, saying the mandatory
pollution reductions would harm American economic interests and
promising to offer alternative measures.

In Kyoto, Japan, the industrialized countries agreed to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by an average 5.2% by 2012 from 1990 levels.

Auken stressed the importance of maintaining a dialogue with the U.S. -
the world's biggest polluter - on environmental matters.

""The way forward is not to take a defensive position but to show
leadership,"" he said. ""Without the E.U. it is difficult to imagine a
successful global climate policy that will really make a real difference
to the environment.""

E.U. leaders have pledged to go forward with the ratification process
despite the U.S. rejection and say it's possible to get the necessary
approval from 55 countries.

World delegations will reconvene in Bonn, Germany, in July for another
attempt to draft details of the treaty.

1880,"FYI
",,,FYI
1881,"Two weeks ago, Phil Harris sent a letter to the CEOs of PJM member-companies 
urging them to designate a representative to participate in PJM's 
Communications Group.  The initial step would be to highlight the four years 
of success in the PJM wholesale market and enhance the public's confidence in 
the value of competitive electric markets.  

Since Enron has already committed money to EPSA's multi-state communications 
effort as well as an aggressive communications plan in NY, I thought it would 
be useful to meet with PJM's manager of communications to try and get a 
better idea of what they are trying to achieve.  

On Friday, June 1st, I met with Beth Foley -- PJM's Manager of 
Communications.  Beth is new to PJM.  The bottom line is that PJM has never 
had a communications office.  Press inquiries and other external 
communications have been handled from PJM's customer care center.  This year, 
PJM decided it needed to create a new division to deal soley with 
communications/pr issues.

As of last week, 35 member companies had responded to the letter from Phil 
Harris.  The next step is likely to be a meeting of all the interested 
companies in PA.  

They're starting from ground zero, so I shared some of Enron's experiences in 
NY and DC with her:

Research is useful in order to define message points, and keep the effort 
focused
Many companies are being asked to fund various ""communications plans"" as a 
result of the CA fallout.  These companies (including Enron) expect their 
dollars to create value for them, and if the communications efforts are 
repetitive or not providing value then the efforts aren't worth funding.
External assistance in the development of a pr plan are extremely useful and 
necessary for comprehensive efforts.
Buy-in from member companies on the message points will be a critical first 
step and will require a good amount of time in the early stages.
Need to identify the overall goal and time-frame for achieving them.  (PJM is 
not really attempting to do a ""summer crisis"" effort.  Their's is much more 
long-term focused.

Tom Hoatson and I are on PJM's list as contacts for this effort.  And I 
expect to hear back from PJM in the near future regarding a meeting of all 
the interested parties.

lindy:

thanks for the input.

also, per your request from yesterday, attached please find a PDF file with 
the visual concept board that was presented at last friday's meeting.  again, 
as we discussed, this is NOT an ad, and it's not intended to be presented as 
an ad, despite the fact that it very much looks like an ad.  rather, it's an 
illustration of how the research-based strategic insights to this complex 
issue can be distilled down to a single-minded concept with an easy visual 
read.  as i mentioned yesterday, i am concerned that anyone who will view 
this ad out of context could misconstrue what it is and what its purpose is.

1883,"Here is a brief synopsis of my view of LDC gas hedging, which I just chewed 
Harry's ear off explaining:

1.  Commission needs to understand how hedging works.  In a typical market 
situation, the supplier of a good negotiates with the consumer, who can 
explain to the supplier what his appetite for risk and term is, and then the 
supplier can come up with the appropriate pricing and term (eg. all spot, 
fixed price, pricing within a band). In other words, the hedge reflects the 
customer's specific wants and needs.

2.  When a utility tries to hedge for its amorphous group of bundled sales 
customers, it lacks the specific knowledge of  the appetite for risk that 
group has, and in fact, the appetites will be all over the place.  Therefore, 
the hedging will not be perfect.  If a utility locks in some pricing at term, 
there is always the risk that a hindsight regulatory review will find that 
the price was too high in light of later market developments, or that too 
much reliance was placed on spot, which may have moved up.  What utilities 
need then, is the guidance to hedge, and then freedom from hindsight review.  
(This gives ENA a good market for its hedged products and removes regulatory 
risk involved with those products.)

3.  When the utility hedges, it faces potential stranded costs, which arise 
if load leaves.  Thus, to mitigate the potential and size of this problem, 
the hedged portfolio should only be dedicated to those customers for whom 
leaving for transportation is not a real option (residential and small 
commercial).  If larger customers are on sales service, their rates should 
reflect market index prices, as they do have the ability to leave, and spot 
pricing removes the stranded cost and undercollection concerns.  (It also 
gives us something easy to market against).  In other words, we need 2 PGA's,

Cynthia has dramatically increased her attacks on me in recent days--I've had 
""warnings"" from a number of people.
She's openly saying that I have no Hill experience, she has attacked my use 
of outside consultants, she has challenged my handling of the BLM/Forest 
Service issue.
Today I heard about a message she sent to someone outside the company, 
""suggesting"" to them that they never meet with me alone, but always have 
Chris Long present, and further that any communications with me in the future 
copy Scott and Donald.  In short, she's now trying to undercut my authority 
not just inside the office, but outside the office as well.
I've requested a meeting Thursday morning with Joe and Cynthia.  My strategy 
will be to say to Cynthia ""if there's anything you want to say to me, now is 
the time,"" and to turn to Joe and say ""You supervise both of us and I 
appreciate your being here to help us sort this out.""

1890,"This morning Enron was interviewed by the Federal Reserve, CFTC, SEC, and the Department of Treasury (also attending were the OCC and the FDIC).  Scott Gahn from the commercial group lead the discussion and Vicki Sharp (legal), Mark Taylor (legal) and I supported Scott on the legal and regulatory issues.
The goal in the meeting was to provide the agencies information so they can draft an interagency document on the retail swap market and its regulation by end of the year as required by the CFMA.

Going into the meeting we knew that the CFTC and the Fed were more likely to support the retail swap industry expansion, with the SEC and Treasury more interested in a regulatory structure that allows their ""clients"" , the banks and broker/dealers to offer the swaps and protect against systemic risk.  The agency which extended lead the meeting - in our case the CFTC.   The other firms interviewed are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman, JP Morgan-Chase, Bank of America, ISDA, and Blackbird.

First, we noted that our targeted customers are the small to medium size business, not the residential consumer.  We argued that we can offer bundled retail swaps to those not meeting the eligible contract participant (ECP) requirements in deregulated markets where physically deliver is legal and possible, but unbundling the swap from the physical prohibits retail swaps to non-ECP customers.  This is a large markets (8.1 million potential mass market and small mass market customers) and the benefits of swaps to manage the volatility of deregulating markets should not be reserved to the Fortune 1,000.   The consumers would be full requirements consumers, so speculation would be managed.  If speculation and market manipulation were to occur state and common-law antifraud provisions are available.

We were able to isolate the SEC at the beginning the meeting by noting that we were not planning equity swaps.  The Treasury representative asked questions about manipulation, consumer protection, and the California situation for retail consumers.The OCC was concerned about coordination with state financial regulators and if this would be a barrier to market entry.

The USG agency officials acknowledged that the retail swaps in energy and other commodities were useful risk management products, but some disagree as the regulatory treatment. At the end of meeting, Treasury said that ""do you expect us to exempt Enron solely in from regulation in offering these products?"".  We said yes if we are willing to offer sound risk management products to our customers 

Best development: The CFTC official pulled us aside after the meeting and said that while Treasury may not willing to solely exempting Enron, the CFTC has the authority and is willing to consider just an exemption.  The CFTC is  interested in acting quickly to offer regulatory relief and legal certainty for those firms interested in offering these products under the ECP level.  She wants to sit down with us very shortly to decide how best to get move this at the CFTC, either through a formal rulemaking or no action letter.   The goal would be to act before the swap report is released in December, avoid legislative changes (which we strongly oppose), and allow for product innovation.

As per your request, I checked the accuracy of press news about  Eletrobolt Contract.

There is nothing concrete yet. There are ongoing negotiations with the government. The recently created, government owned trading company will pay Enron R$ 180/MWh until June 2002 to eliminate MAE's credit risk (due to delays in settling contracts). There is a compensatio mechanism involved. Joal expects to have this contract signed by the end of this week. He still thinks we should continue hammering to fix the uncertainties related to price formation, which is an item I have been providing ad hoc support.

summer long
on power

Cinergy CEO Jim Rogers told Restructuring Today in a three-part
interview that this summer prices will be low and electric supplies
plentiful.
     Is it the result of the June 1998 price spike that rose to $7,500?
Did the high price lure in generation that's now providing ECAR
consumers with economical prices at a time when the West Coast is being
punished for not doing the same?
     ""The short answer is yes,"" Rogers replied.
     ECAR is getting 4,000 mw more capacity this summer, he added.
     Rogers thinks the Ohio market will be slow to open and may not get
robust for five years.  He was critical of other IOUs that are dragging
their feet in RTO formation.
     We'd love to send you the Rogers interview and others we've
published recently:

1922,"I am quite involved and there are lots of regulatory/governmental issues.

1) First, a comment about the $$$ requested to complete the project. There is 
no way to cover the embarrassment factor. Last December a substantial budget 
increase has requested and approved by the Board. Reportedly on a 
never-come-back-again basis. However, as it was later discovered, a) it did 
not included a number of major charges that had been spent but never 
accounted for and b) had a more optimistic scenario of project completion. 

2) Shell has not made a commitment to increase their pro-rata investment. 
They have until May 15 decide. We may have a dispute eventually leading to 
Arbitration

3) In order to improve the economics of the project, as of May 4, we are 
terminating the YPF gas contract, it is a  contract right, and renegotiating 
with YPF and others. This may be going to Arbitration.

4) And, lastly we have a full blown dispute with Furnas, inching each day 
towards arbitration/litigation before its is finally settled. The root case 
of the dispute was the interference of government agency (something -like the 
independent public Attorney's office - the ""Ministerio Publico"") on the 
construction of the pipeline and now its was grown into the controversy, 
involving Aneel,  because of the Cuiaba contract was the result of the Bid, 
under am old regulatory regime, and now Furnas wants us to take the market 
risks of the new regulatory system. See two files below








5) Last week we finally forced the issue with Furnas getting closer to a 
legal dispute. We put them on notice of our Contract  rights under the 
Goverment Action/Forece Majure Clauses In parallel we are also launching a 
lobbying effort to get our story across the government officials.  I have a 
more pesimistic view than  Pete about the speed of success. Logically he is 
correct,  ""How can the government of Brazil allow this matter to spin out of 
control if we engage in a legal fight"". He is hopeful that using our 
government levers we can get a quicker resolution. My reading is that the 
present Brazilian government is very split on energy issues and there are 
those in the government coalition that would welcome a dispute to stop the 
privatization efforts. 

I believe that we have to launch the lobbying effort for PR purposes; but 
that it will not produce results until we take Furnas to court  (not prevent 
a legal dispute)  and there is a clear reading that we are correct. The 
center piece of the dispute will be our claim of government interference and 
the analysis of our project management effort during this period of Force 
Majeure. In other words, can we collect part of the bubget overrun from 
Furnas? Our detailed analysis will be ready at the end of May.

6) On the bright side, due to the Brazilian energy crisis, Aneel  called me 
last Tuesday to let me know that it had been decided that they will extend 
the current diesel subsidy for half the plant output to December (R$24 
million per month) and expand the diesel coverage to the whole plant through 
Furnas, where Furnas would pay for the diesel in the other half of the power 
plant another R$24 million per month). I will have to negotiate a Contract 
Amendment,

Jose

1940,"Dear Murray,

 We have historically taken on the following counterparties for checkout:

  Montana Power - purchases and sales of imbalance energy (taken on May 2000 with prior month cleanup)
  Bonneville Power - purchases and sales (taken on Jan 2000)
  PGE     - purchases, sales, transmission (taken on March 2001 - before that, apparently Diana Scholtes helped w/ checkouts)
  Smurfit Stone -  purchases and sales (taken on December 2000 / January 2001)
  Snohomish - transmission  (taken on August 2000)
  Nevada Power - transmission (taken on May 2000)


  Since I have been with Volume Management, we have cleaned-up the following thus far:

  Pacificorp - Transmisison August 2000 thru December 2000 and Purchases and sales September 2000
  Bonneville - Transmission August 2000 thru December 2000
  Portland General - Purchases, sales, and transmission for August 2000 - September 2000 and November 2000
  

 The following have been presented as priorities for true-up to be done NOW: 

  PGE - Purchases and sales true-up for October 2000  

  PAC - We are awaiting DMS's for the October and November outstanding stuff.  - was informed of 6-8-01

  BPA - Purchases and sales true-up for June 2000 thru August 2000.  - was given 4-19-01

  CRC - Purchases and Sales true-up for December 2000 - was informed of 6-8-01

  El Paso - Purchases and sales true-up for May 2001 (Kate Symes in the Real Time group is working on this)

  Snohomish - Purchases and sales true-up for December 2000 and Jan - March 2001 - was informed of yesterday 6-11-01
 
  Dynegy - Purchases and sales true-up for September 2000  - never got trued up last year


 IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS WHERE WE STAND WITH TRUE UPS. 
 IF WE ASK HOUSTON TO HELP US IN THE RESEARCH AND TRUE-UP PROCESS, I THINK THAT THE MANUAL THAT I PUT TOGETHER REGARDING HOW TO RESEARCH DIFFERENT DISPUTE TYPES WILL COME IN VERY HANDY.

PLEASE CONTACT ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS.

1941,"Thanks Geoff.

 ",Geoff,,
1942,"Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

1990,"Good Morning,

We will be rolling out a new version of Deal Entry & Deal Blotter this 
afternoon to support California scheduling & volume management.  For most of 
the users, there will be no impact except for a few new fields that can be 
ignored in Enpower's Deal Entry.  Below is a list of the changes:


Deal Entry (These fields should only be populated for California deals)
1.  Added Settlement Entity - Identifies where the power is scheduled and 
settled.

2.  Added Sched Coordinator - Identifies the coordinator responsible for 
scheduling the power.

3.  Schedule Type - Defines the type of schedule used in California.

4.  Market Reference - Defines the market when the power will flow.

Deal Blotter 
1.  Deal Blotter will be defaulting these 4 values if the deal is in 
California.

The cat thinks for a moment and says, ""Lord, all my life I have lived with a

there to greet them with the same offer.  The mice answer, ""All of our lives

running;  we're tired of running. Do
you think we could have roller skates so we don't have to run anymore?""

skates.

2 Issues - an easy language issue and a more complicated regulatory issue.

First the easy one.

It seems to me that since the weekend language says to use the preceding 
business day that these two sentences will always result in the preceding 
business day's price being used, regardless of whether the holiday is a 
Monday or a Friday:

If a statutory holiday falls on a Monday or a Friday, the Enron Daily Index 
for such day shall be the Enron Daily Index for the weekend occurring closest 
to such day.  If a statutory holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or 
Thursday, the Enron Daily Index for such day shall be the Enron Daily Index 
for the previous business day.

If that's what's intended, I don't think we need these lines (it's all 
covered int he prior parenthetical).  If we mean something else I don't think 
this language works.

Otherwise the language all looked fine.  

The harder issue is the US regulatory one.  The CFTC gives a higher level of 
scrutiny to electronic systems that provide not only trading but also price 
discovery.   That's why we don't refer to the EnronOnline prices reported on 
the system as ""indices"" but just average prices.  We may be OK here since 
this is a Canadian price (although its availability to US cutomers my sink 
us) and it is only for trades where Enron is a party.  I've got a call in to 
our CFTC counsel asking for thier take on this and will let you know as soon 
as I hear back (he's pretty quick at responding so I expect it should be this

",John,,GTC
2072,"Justin -

Further to our conversation yesterday I have reviewed the existing HDD Swap 
GTC's.  In contrast to the Financial GTC's which when read with the ETA are 
drafted on the basis that the GTC's only apply if an ISDA has not been 
executed,  the HDD Swap GTC's have been drafted to work in unison with the 
ISDA framework.  The HDD Swap GTC together with the specific documentation 
for each transaction constitutes a Confirmation under the ISDA Form.   I have 
made some drafting changes in this regard the most important of which is the 
carve out of the language in the ETA which provides that GTC's will only 
apply if an ISDA has been executed. 

Incidentally - with respect to the ETA - it seems to provide that the 
relevant GTC's will apply in respect of a Transaction if an ISDA is not in 
place on the trade date of such transaction, however it does not seem to make 
any provision for circumstances where an ISDA/Master Agreement is entered 
into subsequent to the execution of a Transaction.   In such circumstances on 
a literal interpretation of the ETA, the pre-existing Transaction would 
continued to be governed by the GTC but future Transactions would be governed 
by the ISDA/Master Agreement.  From a netting perspective this is not ideal.  
Is this the intention ?

One of the current priorities of  Casino Willamette  is our Services Desk, a 
relatively new concept whereby we supposedly do a bunch of California 
scheduling coordination services for customers who are too unsophisticated to 
deal with California complexity,  earn a reasonable little fee and, here is 
the kicker,  the whole enterprise is seen as involving ""very little risk.""  
It is seen as picking up a fair bit of change off the floor with no risk,   
as though a slot machine broke and a bunch of quarters rolled around on the 
floor and all we have to do is scrape them up.  Not big money, but safe 
money.  ""Pays the overhead,"" one often hears traders remark.  

I have drafted a series of confirms over last year to document a variety of 
transactions and am in the process of reviewing them with an eye to constant 
improvement.  I am having a series of discussions with traders, schedulers 
and settlement folks and one risk that keeps coming up in their minds, which 
I am not really sure I have covered in our documents is referred to as 
""system outage risk.""   Interaction with the Cal PX and the California ISO is 
all online electronic.  Scheduling power into the California market is all an 
online business.  So let us say that one bright spring morning we have agreed 
with our 17 SC customers to schedule a variety of power products into and out 
of the California system, and right at the critical moment when all of this 
scheduling stuff is supposed to click, the whole damn system collapses?  
Apparently we have a bunch of system apparatus that is our own,  that is, it 
is not just our link up to the California entities.  One time our  tie line 
got cut (middle of night, no problem because they got it fixed in time)  Is 
this kind of internal system breakdown an event of force majeure,  or is it a 
default on our part?  I have been reading our eol agreements, in particular, 
the ETA and am not sure how to address it.  Is it appropriate in the new age 
electronic commerce world for a party providing electronically based  
services to just tell everybody that if our system goes down we are not 
liable and by the way, if it causes a bunch of costs to come flowing back 
from the ISO,  the other poor guy has to pay them?  I would appreciate your 
thoughts, based on your eol experience.  ",Mark,,the Cal PX SC ETA ISO

shows how Enron uses the tools/system(s) and two, a demo on how a company 
such as Carghill would use the tools in a private application.  This will all 
then be set up so it can be shown on the road or in house to clients.  Dave 
and Mark have started this work today.

Mark Taylor will work the following two legal issues in parallel:  First, 
find outside council that will be able to help with the internal audit of all 
legal contracts associated with EOL as well as be able to assist in legal 
matters associated with the due diligence and assist in contract work 
associated with the actual sale in the future.  The legal audit must be 
prepared and completed by early next week so we can keep our planned visit 
with i2 late next week and feel comfortable that we can sell we are proposing 
to sell from a legal standpoint.

Jay will complete the technical audit and write up his conclusions (or Kevin).

Rex and Greg will continue to refine the list of potential clients and the 
appropriate contacts on the list.  Any suggestions on how to make sure we 
have the right names, etc. just send them in to Rex.

Rex will also refine the actual presentation to be used in the pitch and get

online.  They posed the following questions that I did not know the answer 
to.  Can you help me out on getting them a response today if possible?

1.  They would like to know the intent behind the sentence in Section (2) of 
the password application that prohibits the user form using the password 
outside their country.  I told them it was probably a tax driven issue but 
was not sure.

2.  They need to know if the user must scroll through and agree to the GTC 
each time they transact a trade.  I believe each product is represented by a 
separate line on the page and that each product has its own GTC even thought 
several related products will probably have identical GTCs.  I told them I 
thought that for each product that you only had to select it once, but that 
for each product, even if the GTC is the same as another produce you have 
reviewed, you must accept the GTC again.  Is this correct?

3.  Are the Enron trading entities signing service agreements with EOL for 
use of the system?

4.  They wanted to know if the trading entities providing the prices etc. for 
each product could be considered ""content"" for EOL and be considered value 
for which EOL should pay the trading entities.  I haven't heard of this issue 
before but I said I would ask.

5.  As a proof issue, what would be the process of proving and electronic 
trade?  How can we show we have not modified the screens or manipulated the 
data.  How would the data be presented to a court?  

6.  How long are the electronic trades retained in our systems and how are 
they retained?

2093,"Dear Mark (back from South America?)

I received this email from Donna Greif.  It explains the sources for her data 
which she puts on EnronOnline every day.  As best I know, Mark, we don't have 
any agreement with any of these people for content that we place online.

I'm not too concerned about the weather (it's from the Canadian and American 
governments) but I am concerned about the NGTL data and the data we get from 
Telerate.

We have a disclaimer Online for the NGTL data, saying that it's our 
reproduction and not a representation of what they have on their own site 
(their own site which can be accessed through a password only!), but I think 
this proves, rather than refutes, the fact that we're redistributing their 
data without a right to do so.  The same applies for Telerate--we don't even 
give them recognition--we just post their numbers on our site.

I know you're a busy man, and I'm sure you're dealing with things like 
lawsuits against Enron by South American governments, or something like that, 
but this issue should (a) be dropped, because you believe that it's really 
not that important or (b) resolved, becuase you think it is.

Please tell me how I can help, or if we should let this issue drop.  If I 
don't hear from you, I'll assume that you don't think it's an important issue.

2094,"NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT, 
THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGAL 
DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO

As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries 
where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via 
EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway, 
Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the 
occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the 
Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or 
its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed 
currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differs 
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in 
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms of 
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely 
change the analysis below.)

Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more 
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page ""Executive Summary 
of Legal Advice"" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant 
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction 
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus on 
issues we raised which are ""all clear"" from a legal perspective, so as to 
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news 
too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out below 
what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, on 
the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely 
to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a 
risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk 
is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.

A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000

 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US

B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be 
delayed

 Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)

C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)

The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and 
related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks 
of a general nature:

(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our 
counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the 
product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional 
documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies to 
almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in 
all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general 
law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under 
their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their 
constitutional documents if they wish to trade).  

The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading 
relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particularly 
onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.

(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure 
that we are not misusing confidential information about our business 
counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur 
both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not include 
formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or 
the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US 
counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include 
(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the 
procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure that 
confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which 
we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality 
agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron 
has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, or 
otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will 
need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Without 
such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that 
entity for breach of confidence.

D.  Country Specific Issues

(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute 
insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the 
product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve 
this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in 
Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear 
which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.

(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in 
Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.

(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be 
regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and 
unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a 
""substantial professional effort"" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being 
entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our 
counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade 
by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should 
therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this 
product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic 
behind its trading this product type.

(iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading 
relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisory 
authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being 
unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterparty 
(which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offence 
will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  However, 
I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing 
business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.

(v)  US (New York Law) 

(a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an 
option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions under 
the US Commodities Exchange Act. 

(b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product 
constitutes a ""security"" under US securities laws (please see attached 
Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of 
securities to ""accredited investors"" which will allow us to deal with 
investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our 
counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test should 
not impede the business.

(c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider 
trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security 
(see (b) above) is relatively remote.

 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase ""with annual redetermination"" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.
