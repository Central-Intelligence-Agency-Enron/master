I will get a room for our Wednesday 10:00 meeting and e-mail you with the

the storage problem and to ask you some specific questions regarding

Also, if you have time, could you send me a definition of Intra-Month Risk?

5,"Questions about 12/29 rentroll:

 There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other 
for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?


 A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have the 
concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project 
are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  
Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 
million.  The components are as follows:

 Unit Cost, Site work, &
 builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million

 Land      1.15

 Interim Financing     .85

 Common Areas       .80

 Total     $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to 
get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A 
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce 
the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the 
seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is 
currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to 
the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market 
will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely 
increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost 
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He 
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  
We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we 
cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   
We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.

Phillip

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.

I wanted to get this discussion going via written format so that I (or others who may implement this) can stay focused on what you want and not get into broader research, etc....

I think I can put a model together if we can define what parameters, the interface (levers) and model (transfer functions) to use that would be useful for you as phase I product.

I will fire off updates to this document as I make them.  If you have a spec doc or ideas that you want to hand write on a print out, please do so and I will update the document. 

I will like to make sure that I am on the same page before beginning to code the program and to start linking to additional moths (month 2, 3, ..) and different curves, etc.

My Job search has gone well with the Crude desk and I am waiting compensation indication from them to make my decision. Also, Kevin Presto feels that I could potentially help his power group with new market or spread trading.  John Suarez is a director who came from the power desk to EBS is going back to work for Kevin Presto.  I may have an opportunity to build the southeast market by supporting John.

I am very grateful that I met you and other key Enron traders during this job search.

48,"so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not 
bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of 
recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a 
little far fetched to me.  Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have 
had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential 
industrial switching processing...    
as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was 
extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be 
running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 
5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from 
waha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent 
reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where 
gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of 
more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build 
the stack now to estimate.  
frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will 
continue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering 
right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 
100,000 last week as gas got to parity.  
let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from 
engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen 
demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.
bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really 
inactive.
to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj 
numbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts 
to clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short 
right now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller though
not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense.  
however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to 
great in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other.  
notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?
in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50 
cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.  
market needs to see some big stg numbers first.   
i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.  
Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last 
year's early weather, bombs away.

News Brief

+High Cost of Oil and Natural Gas Puts FPL $518 Million Behind in Fuel
Expense Recovery

Faced with skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices and heavy seasonal demand
for electricity, Florida Power & Light Company has filed preliminary
paperwork with the Florida Public Service Commission identifying $518
million in expenses above projections for fuel burned to produce electricity
in 2000. FPL will file with the Commission in September for permission to
recover the expense in customer bills beginning Jan. 1, 2001.

Part of this increase will be offset by a refund to customers that is
currently estimated to be $75 million to $100 million. The refund is
pursuant to an agreement reached in April 1999 with the Office of the Public
Counsel and the FPSC that provides for revenue sharing between FPL and its
customers, as well as a 6% annual rate reduction for three years. As a
result of the forecasted fuel costs and the expected rebate, residential
electric rates could increase by approximately 13% per kilowatt-hour.

The cost of oil used to generate electricity has more than doubled since the
first quarter of 1999 and has not been this high since the Gulf War in 1990.
Since January 2000, oil prices have increased 44% per barrel. Natural gas
prices also have risen unabated, climbing 77% since January 2000. With the
onset of winter, natural gas prices may increase further as demand for
heating fuel increases.

Enron's businesses.

EBS ""Go-Live""

On April 1st, Enron Broadband Services supplemented their current SAP 
functionality with HR Online and SAP HR, including payroll and organizational 
structure management.  HR Online enables the EBS population to enter their 
own time, view and update their personal information, and view their vacation 
time and individual payroll information via Enron's intranet.

Additionally, this implementation enhanced the SAP Financial, Project and 
Procurement processes that EBS has had in operation since April 1, 1999.  
These enhancements included an EBS pilot of B2B, a web-based requisitioning 
tool. Among the benefits of these enhancements will be improved information 
flow across business units currently on SAP.

July 1 ""Go-Live""

This final Apollo and Beyond implementation will directly impact more than 
15,000 Enron employees and contractors -- odds are that you are one of them!  
People impacted on July 1st include:

all Enron employees paid out of Corporate Payroll in Houston, excluding 
Azurix employees
the financial communities of Enron Energy Services, Enron Investment 
Partners, Enron North America, Enron Renewable Energy Corporation, Gas 
Pipeline Group, Global Finance, and Global Products.
the project management communities of Enron North America, Gas Pipeline 
Group, Global Asset Operations, Global Finance, and Global Products.
the human resources communities of Corporate, Global E&P, Enron Energy 
Services, Enron Engineering and Construction Company, Enron Investment 
Partners, Enron North America, Enron Renewable Energy Corporation (Houston 
only), the international regions, Gas Pipeline Group, Global Finance, and 
Global Products.

General SAP training will be available in late April via the Enron intranet.  
Additional, specific, SAP classes and workshops are scheduled to begin in May 
and continue through August.  Information on the project can be obtained 
through the Enron intranet at http://sap.enron.com and by contacting Business 
Unit representatives currently working with the project.  A list of Business 
Unit representatives is located on the intranet site.

Additional information related to the July 1st implementation will be 
communicated to you over the next few months.

Thank you.

game.  oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat

get real . . .  one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a

mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same

Chicago Bears have informed NFLtalk that wide receiver Marcus Robinson
suffered a lower back strain with muscle spasms in practice yesterday. He
was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment and observation
last night and was evaluated by Bears team orthopedist Michael Schafer.
Robinson is listed on the Bears injury report as questionable for this

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  ""We'll see Wednesday or Thursday,"" said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, ""but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play.""    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.     

 Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The status of the Jets' running back for this week's game against the Bears 
is still uncertain.  Martin left Sunday's game in Miami with what was 
described as a strained back, and never returned to the field.  He had an 
examination by team doctors yesterday, and had some X-rays taken as well.  
The club hasn't released any information on the resluts of the exam.  If 
Martin is on your Fantasy squad, your best bet is to stay tuned as the week 
progresses.     

 Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 According to New York Newsday , Coles will be unable to play in this week's 
game against the Bears.  He was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff of 
the second half in Sunday's win over the Dolphins.  If Coles is an integral 
part of your roster, look to pick up Dedric Ward, who should get more playing 
time in Coles' absence.    

 Billy Joe Tolliver , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints re-signed Tolliver yesterday, after the 10-year veteran had been 
cut by the team during training camp. With Jeff Blake out for the season, New 
Orleans needed a No. 3 quarterback, so Tolliver will fill that role behind 
starter Aaron Brooks and backup Jake Delhomme.  

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints placed Blake on injured reserve yesterday, officially ending his 
season. He will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as 
soon as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is determined. 
Blake will be replaced by Aaron Brooks.  

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith's status is still not certain, but he does expect to return for 
Sunday's game against the Colts.  He left last week's game against the Jets 
after aggravating his strained right hamstring, an injury which he sustained 
a week earlier against the Chargers.  Smith has been one of the year's 
biggest Fantasy sleepers, and has become an everyday starter for those 
Fantasy owners who were lucky enough to grab him.  If he does in fact play 
this week, be sure to include him in your starting lineup.    

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Although his status is still up in the air, Fiedler expects that he will be 
ready to play in Sunday's AFC showdown against the Colts.  Fiedler was 
injured on the first play of the Jets' game when linebacker Mo Lewis drove 
his head and shoulder into the turf. He suffered a slightly seperated 
throwing shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back.  Fielder isn't one 
of the better options in the Fantasy game, so avoid playing him this week 
even if he does start.  

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/21/00 
 The Redskins should know by Thursday if Johnson can re-assume his starting 
job for this week's showdown against the Eagles.  He has started to test his 
injured left knee with some light dropbacks and will likely push the knee 
harder during practice on Wednesday and Thursday.    

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With the injury to Ike Hilliard, Jurevicius will likely start this week's 
game at Arizona.  With only 12 receptions on the entire season, Jurevicius 
isn't a solid Fantasy option, so don't pick him up unless your roster is 
really straped for receivers.    

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Antoine Winfield has been lost for the rest of the season with a 
torn labrum in his right shoulder.  He suffered the injury three weeks ago 
against New England. Winfield has tried to play through the pain, but has 
aggravated the injury in each of Buffalo's last two games.  Head Coach Wade 
Phillips announced to the media that Winfield will have surgery on 
Wednesday.  His loss will hurt Buffalo's secondary, but they remain a solid 
defense in the world of Fantasy.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Huard the starter for this week's game 
against the Broncos.  Huard took all of the snaps with the first team offense 
after a bye week, and is ready to make his first start since sustaining a 
concussion on Oct. 22 in Oakland.  Huard isn't considered a solid Fantasy 
option, so don't start him until he shows some signs that he is ready to 
produce.    

 Cardinals , DT ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Arizona defense came out of Sunday's loss to the Eagles extremely banged 
up.  Linebacker Zach Walz, who just recently returned from knee surgery, is 
out with a broken left leg.  Defensive tackle Mark Smith hurt his shoulder 
and had his arm in a sling on Monday.  Safety Kwamie Lassiter was also 
injured in the game, suffering a sprained knee. With all of these injuries on 
defense, it's probably a good idea to keep the Cardinals' defense on the 
bench this week.      

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Alstott probably will miss the rest of the regular season after spraining 
his left knee in Tampa Bay's 13-10 loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday.  The 
Bucs described Alstott's injury as a third-degree sprain of the medial 
collateral ligament and said he is expected to be sidelined six to eight 
weeks.  Charles Kirby, a third-year pro in his first season with Tampa Bay, 
will replace Alstott.     

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 Toomer posted a great day for his Fantasy owners against Detroit, catching 
eight passes for 108 yards in the Giants' 31-21 loss. He may have a more 
difficult time next week against Arizona's All-Pro cornerback Aeneas 
Williams, so start him at your own discretion.      

 Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Barber caught eight passes and compiled 129 yards of total offense in 
Sunday's loss to the Lions.  Look for Barber to get a number of looks out of 
the backfield this week against Arizona, as the Giants attempt to compensate 
for the loss of wide receiver Ike Hilliard.   

 Kerry Collins , QB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Collins threw a season-high 51 passes on Sunday, but it wasn't enough to 
tame the Lions.  Collins has been a more productive Fantasy option of late, 
throwing eight touchdown passes in his last three games. He may run into a 
road block this week against the Cardinals, however, especially if Ike 
Hilliard is unable to play.  Without Hilliard, Arizona can put All-Pro 
cornerback Aeneas Williams on Amani Toomer, leaving Tiki Barber and Pete 
Mitchell as Collins' only real receiving options. If you can find a better 
quarterback than Collins this week, it might be a good idea to use 
him.           

 James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 11/20/00 
 McKnight caught four passes for 50 yards in Sunday's loss at Baltimore.  He 
could, however, be a good sleeper pick this week against the Vikings.  
Minnesota's secondary can be beaten downfield, so look for McKnight to try 
and break a few long ones in an effort to spark a banged up Dallas offense.   
 

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Smith had his second consecutive subpar performance on Sunday against the 
Ravens, rushing for only 48 yards on eleven carries. He has been held to only 
64 yards rushing in the past two weeks, which is significant when you 
consider that Smith is one of the league's greatest running backs of 
all-time.  The combination of a short week and the loss of center Mark 
Stepnoski will hurt Smith's production, so it might be a good idea to sit him 
this week if your roster allows it.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Aikman found out just how good the Ravens' defense is on Sunday.  He 
completed just 19-of-33 passes for 138 yards and three interceptions in 
Dallas' 27-0 loss in Baltimore. Aikman faces a Minnesota defense on 
Thanksgiving that has been solid in recent weeks, so don't expect any kind of 
Fantasy explosion from the Cowboys' aging quarterback.      

 Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Hilliard, who left Sunday's game against the Lions with a bruised sternum 
and lung, will remain in the hospital for the next two days and will likely 
miss this Sunday's game against Arizona. Look for Joe Jurevicius to start in 
Hilliard's place, but don't expect him to produce the same type of numbers 
that Hilliard has posted.     

 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Anderson ran 17 times for 76 yards against the 49ers Sunday.  Although he 
has become more confident in putting weight on his bad knee, you probably 
won't see Anderson have a big game until next season.  Don't expect things to 
get any better for Anderson next week when he goes up against a tough Raiders 
run defense.     

 Johnnie Morton , WR DET - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Morton awakened from his slumber to catch six passes for  78 yards against 
the Giants Sunday.  He only had one catch in each of the Lions last three 
games.  Morton will probably struggle once again this Thursday when the Lions 
face a formidable Patriots secondary.     

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/20/00 
 While completing 23-of-36 passes, Favre threw for 301  yards with two 
touchdowns and one interception.  He showed extreme toughness Sunday, 
starting the game despite suffering a sprained foot a week earlier.  He 
should be just as effective next week against a docile Panthers pass rush.  
Carolina won't put too much pressure on Favre, allowing him to dissect the 
secondary, and pile up Fantasy points.     

 Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches.  He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday.     

 Ahman Green , RB GB - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Green ran for a career-high 153 yards on 24 carries Sunday against the 
Colts.  His success should continue in upcomings games against the weak run 
defenses of the Panthers, Bears, and Lions.   

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 In relief of Blake, the little-used Brooks completed 14-of-22 passes for 187 
yards, with two touchdowns and one  interception.  Owners of Jeff Blake may 
want to consider picking up Brooks.  It will take some time for Brooks to get 
used to playing in the NFL, but he could put up solid numbers in the final 
games of the season as the Saints face a plethora of weak pass defenses.

  Court Upholds Florida Vote Deadline
  The Associated Press
  Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2000; 1:04 p.m. EST

  TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A Florida judge ruled Tuesday that state
  officials may cut off the vote recount in the state's fiercely
  contested presidential election at 5 p.m. EST.

  Judge Terry Lewis ruled that counties may file supplemental or
  corrected totals after the deadline, and Secretary of State
  Katherine Harris may consider them if she employs ""proper
  exercise of discretion.""

  A Proposal to End the Impasse in Florida: A Summary
  Tuesday, November 14, 2000

  Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney want to bring some finality
  to the election process in Florida.  They believe the American
  people are troubled by the prospect of seemingly endless counts
  and recounts until one side achieves the results it seeks.

  The vote in Florida has been counted.  It has been recounted.
  Both times, Governor Bush has emerged the winner.  And there
  have been no allegations of vote fraud in either the count or
  the recount.  Confusion, yes.  Fraud, no.  Yet the Gore
  campaign refuses to accept the result.

  Rather than accept the result, the Gore campaign has demanded
  manual recounts in predominantly Democratic counties.  In fact,
  the Gore campaign specifically selected overwhelmingly Democratic
  precincts in these counties to recount.

  Broward County
  Precinct 1F: 1308 votes for Gore, 62 for Bush;
  Precinct 6F: 1175 votes for Gore, 52 for Bush;
  Precinct 6C: 1071 votes for Gore, 19 for Bush

  This might lead to the conclusion that the Gore campaign is more
  focused on selectivity than fairness.  Even still, Gore was only
  able to pick up four votes through the manual recounts of the
  three Gore-chosen counties in Democratic Broward County.  Based
  on this small change in votes, the Broward County canvassing board
  voted to not expand the manual recount to the entire county.

  Yet now the Gore campaign wants to force Broward County officials
  to continue the manual count.  This is after they have talked for
  days about letting the local officials run the recounts.  And
  yesterday, the Florida Secretary of State reiterated that
  Florida law unambiguously requires every canvassing board to
  certify its election returns by 5:00pm today.  Amazingly, the
  Gore campaign has filed a lawsuit to block the application of
  the statute.  It seems the Gore campaign places great weight on
  Florida law only when they think it serves their tactics.

  In sum, the Gore campaign has been unwilling to accept any
  finality.  They refused to accept the first vote.  They refused
  to accept the recount.  They refused to accept the manual
  recounts in selective counties.

  That's why today Secretary James A. Baker offered the following
  common sense proposal to solve the impasse:

  Governor Bush has objected to the manual recount.  Vice President
  Gore has objected to today's 5:00pm deadline required by Florida
  law.  Governor Bush is therefore proposing to accept the manual
  recount up to today's 5:00pm deadline if Vice President Gore
  agrees.  This is fair proposal that will bring this divisive
  process to a reasonable conclusion.

  Statement By Former Secretary of State James Baker

  In earlier statements, we have emphasized the importance of
  achieving some finality to the election process, not just here
  in Florida, but of course for the nation as a whole.  More and
  more we see uncertainty in financial markets and we see
  uncertainty abroad. I believe that most observers, whether at
  home or abroad, are troubled by the prospect of seemingly
  endless counts and recounts until a candidate achieves the
  result he seeks.

  The vote in Florida was counted, and then it was recounted.
  Governor Bush was the winner of the vote.  He was the winner
  of the recount. There have been no allegations of vote fraud in
  either the count or in the recount.  No fraud",James Baker Gore Bush Terry Lewis Katherine Harris Cheney James A. Baker,5:00pm,Bush News State 5:00pm

ADD TO THE PLAYOFF FUN

Why leave some teams on the sideline come playoff time? The
league's commissioner can schedule ""consolation"" matchups
during the playoff tournament. In the Front Office, go to
Schedule, Matchups and choose the week(s) that your
playoffs take place. Under ""Other Games,"" you can set any
matchups you want. If there are two teams that split the
regular season series, here's a great way to settle the
score. Of course, these matchups won't count toward your
league's ""official"" championship, but they prolong the
season, and the fun, for those teams that came up short.


STAY ON TOP OF ALL PLAYER INJURY INFO

As the season winds down and your team battles for playoff
positioning, it's more important than ever to have the
latest injury news. Your league's web site contains all the
injury information you need to make informed lineup
decisions. For a snapshot view of all recent player
injuries and status, go to Scouting Reports, Injuries. Go
to Scouting Reports, Player Updates for continually updated
news and fantasy analysis for all NFL players. To see the
most recent updates for the players on your team, go to
Teams, Player News. Also, monitor our News, NFL News page
for weekly Q&A sessions and ""Injury Roundup"" columns from

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.

Thomas Jones scoring the Goalline TD.

I'd forgotten my buddy Jim from Arizona had told me this:   Michael Pittman
wears contact lenses and had a problem with one of his contacts at the
goalline so Jones came in.   If Pittman had not had the problem, he would
have likely gotten the score that Jones did.  (Hope none of you Pittman
owners lost by a TD last week...)

Thanks Jim for keeping me straight.

Actually, I'm using that goof as a chance for David and I, along with the
Footballguys.com staff, to wish you a very Happy Thanksgiving.   It's a
always a time for reflecting on the things we're thankful for and I know
I've got more than I can count.   Hope you do too.   Have a great day and
travel safely if you're going anywhere.

And not to beat up on our Detroit faithful (and I know there are LOT of you
guys), but thought I'd share this one with you if you haven't heard it.
David sent to me this morning:

There is a mama lion, a daddy lion & a baby lion.  The mama lion & the daddy
lion were having a lot of fights so they decided to get a divorce.

The lion family goes in front of a judge to decide custody of the baby lion.
The judge asks the baby lion ""Do you wanna live with mama lion?""   The baby
lion answers ""No mama lion beats me.""  The judge said ""All right, do you
wanna live with daddy lion?""  The baby lion answers ""No daddy lion beats me
worse.""

The judge asks ""who do you wanna live with then?""

The baby answers  ""The Detroit Lions.  They don't beat anybody...""

Have a great weekend all.   Cheatsheets to follow soon.

Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football 
Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox

PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, 
with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, 
Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds 
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not 
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. 
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding 
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your 
regular season. 

If your team is still in contention, go to 
NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes 
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be 
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff 
matchup.


GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the 
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you
are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to
see who's been getting the most consistent production.

148,"Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=

starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=

major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=

played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=

 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/11/00=20
 Marbury, who has missed New Jersey's last four games with a sprained ankle=
,=20
expects to return to the court for the Nets' Tuesday night contest against=
=20
his former team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. ""I'm playing Tuesday.=20
Absolutely,"" said Marbury. ""I know it's going to hurt. I've gotten to the=
=20
point where I feel like I'm confortable.""  Unless you have two solid guards=
=20
with four-game schedules, it would be wise to get Marbury back into your=20
starting lineup this week.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a ""leave"" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20

 Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on th=
e=20
injured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured=
=20
list since Nov. 6 with a fractured jaw. He had a wire removed from his jaw=
=20
Dec. 6 and was cleared to practice Dec. 7. He missed 16 games with the=20
injury.   =20

 Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised=20
leg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks=
=20
last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.=
  =20
=20

 Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00=20
 Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a spraine=
d=20
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewi=
s=20
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but=20
doesn't have much Fantasy value.   =20

 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=
y=20
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=
n=20
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=
=20
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=
n=20
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positi=
ve=20
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt=20
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=
er=20
the current conditions.   =20

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injur=
ed=20
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing=
=20
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.    =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur=
=20
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rook=
ie=20
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined=
=20
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.   =
 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  ""Oak,"" who wa=
s=20
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy valu=
e=20
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deepe=
r=20
leagues.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=
=20
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=
t=20
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn=20
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the ver=
y=20
latest, so add a little ""Vinsanity"" to your starting lineup next week.   =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00=20
 Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The=20
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court =
on=20
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.=
=20
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights=

this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, giv=
e=20
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.   =20

 Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for=20
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but=

has very little Fantasy value.    =20

Big 12: Applewhite eager to reclaim his job
By Mark Wangrin
Express-News Staff Writer

AUSTIN =01* It runs up and down the inside of Major Applewhite's left knee,=
 a=20
four-inch shiny pink speed bump of a scar.=20

If it could talk, it would tell of how the anterior cruciate ligament buckl=
ed=20
as its owner planted while trying to avoid a relentless Arkansas pass rush =
at=20
the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1.

It would tell of the reconstructive surgery by team orthopedist Dr. Carey=
=20
Windler, how the joint was whipped back into shape with hours of work and=
=20
carefully tended with ice bags and heat and extra stretching and anything=
=20
else Applewhite had read, heard or seen that would help keep his return on=
=20
pace.

If the joint could talk, it would tell people how everything's fine inside,=
=20
how Applewhite could drop back and plant, set up or scramble, in a real liv=
e=20
game today if one was scheduled.=20

If it could talk ... well, Applewhite might well be the happiest guy on the=
=20
planet.

Being a quarterback, team guy and newly inaugurated Student Government=20
representative, Applewhite tries to be diplomatic, but part of him wishes h=
e=20
wouldn't have to answer a steady barrage of questions about his knee, no=20
matter how well-meaning the fans might be.

""I don't want to be rude,"" he said last week. ""I just wish they'd stop=20
asking. I love them, appreciate them, but it's getting a little ...""

Got the picture.

OK. So here's the word: Applewhite is 100 percent =01* even ahead of schedu=
le.

Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba=
ck=20
Chris Simms, who with only one career start has graced the cover of The=20
Sporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we=
ek

This word on Applewhite's fitness comes not just from the junior player, bu=
t=20
from the man who's worked most closely with him, physical therapist Allen=
=20
Hardin.

Applewhite, Hardin stresses unequivocally, is ready to play now.

Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range=
=20
when he's had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg.=
=20
During rehab, Hardin ditched the pool work, concentrating instead on=20
sport-specific movements, shortly after Applewhite observed that very few=
=20
football games are played under water.

One of the most effective of the workouts involved pulling on Applewhite wi=
th=20
rubber tubing as the quarterback moved, cut and set up, strengthening his=
=20
supporting muscles and improving his balance.

""If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday, he wasn't happy,=20
because he wanted to be challenged,"" Hardin said. ""It was a challenge to co=
me=20
up with things to challenge him.""

""The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm=
=20
up,"" Applewhite said. ""I'll jog for four minutes instead of two, stretch fo=
r=20
six minutes instead of five.""

After workouts, Applewhite dutifully ices his knee, though he does so based=
=20
more on conventional wisdom than necessity.

""I've always heard you can get tendinitis, so I ice it,"" he said. ""I don't=
=20
have any of the symptoms, so it feels like I'm icing it for no reason.""

In some ways, Applewhite feels he's better for the injury, not the least of=
=20
which being a renewed appreciation for the game.

""So what if I'm tired?"" he said. ""I can rest when I die.""

Resting now isn't a bad thing, either. Applewhite said missing spring drill=
s=20
was a boon for his arm.

""I was throwing so much during the spring (of 1999), summer and season that=
=20
it felt like my arm was run ragged,"" he said.

Of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite=20
takes a hit in the fall. The other question, the one that he can't shake,=
=20
will take a little longer.

Who's the starter going to be =01* Applewhite or Simms?

""I'd be quick to drop in comments about Chris,"" Hardin said of his=20
occasional, and apparently unnecessary, mention of Simms as a motivational=
=20
ploy. ""But I think internally, he'd have worked that hard whatever.""

""It's remarkable the way he's come back,"" said sophomore cornerback Roderic=
k=20
Babers, noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the=
=20
speediest receivers in workouts. ""In two-a-days, it'll be a fair fight.""

Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts,=
=20
Babers said, ""I think (Simms) has the advantage. Major's been sitting out a=
nd=20
Simms' confidence is up, big-time. That's what you need in a quarterback. B=
ut=20
at the same time, Major's a veteran. He's beaten Nebraska. He's beaten them=
=20
all.""

""He's the same old Major,"" cornerback Quentin Jammer said.

Soon Applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback=
=20
duel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee. Now, a=
=20
month before the freshmen report on Aug. 13, he's talking about how he's no=
t=20
competing against Simms, just against himself.

""The competitive nature that Tiger Woods has is the competitive nature I=20
have,"" Applewhite said. ""At Pebble Beach, Tiger was up 15 and had a 10-foot=
er=20
on the last hole for birdie, and he was out there lining it up. He could ha=
ve=20
done the 'Happy Gilmore' tap to the hole and still won. But he wanted it al=
l.""

Simms has bulked up from 208 to 223 pounds, working on his leg and upper bo=
dy=20
strength.

""I feel like there's more to me now, that it's not like the wind's going to=
=20
blow me over,"" he said. ""I don't want to be a wimpy quarterback. I want to =
be=20
like Brett Favre. He's not the biggest or the fastest, but he can run when =
he=20
has to and he can chuck it 80 (yards).

""It's going to come, and it'll get worse,"" Simms said of the building=20
scrutiny. ""To tell you the truth, I don't care. Football's a competitive=20
sport. There's nothing you can do about it.""

So he shrugs it off for now, concentrating on finishing up summer school.=
=20
He's working on his topic for a writing course, ""History of American=20
Baseball."" The book he chose is about Babe Ruth.

In August, the topic switches to college football. The question remains the=
=20
same. And Chris Simms, or Major Applewhite, won't write this story.

They'll live it.

174,"Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

-Reagan

We've been downgrading Chicago WR Marcus Robinson already with Shane
Matthews throwing the ball but here's more bad news from my friends at
www.nfltalk.com

http://www.sportstalk.com/nfl/rumors/index.shtml From the article:  The
Chicago Bears have informed NFLtalk that wide receiver Marcus Robinson
suffered a lower back strain with muscle spasms in practice yesterday. He
was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment and observation
last night and was evaluated by Bears team orthopedist Michael Schafer.
Robinson is listed on the Bears injury report as questionable for this
weekend's game with Green Bay and his status will be updated tomorrow.

More as I hear it but right now it's not looking too good.

Thought ya might get a kick outta this, nothin much goin on here, just a
buncha rain.



AL GORE WENT DOWN TO FLORIDA
(to the tune of ""The Devil Went Down To Georgia"", by Charlie Daniels band)

Al Gore went down to Florida He was lookin' for an election to steal.

He was in a bind Cause he was way behind, And he was willin' to cut a deal.

When he came across a Gov'ner Knawin' on a victory and chewin' hard Veep
Gore jumped up on a hickory stump and said, ""Gov, let me tell you what""

""I bet you didn't know it but I'm a contender in Florida too, and if you
care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.

Now you ran a good campaign down here, but give Al Gore his due.

I'll bet a nation of gold and the white house it holds, that I got more
votes than you!""

The gov'ner said, ""My names Dubya and it might be a sin....

But I'll take that bet, your gonna regret, cause this Texan always wins""

(Chorus)

Dubya rally up your troops and fight for that vote hard.

Cause Al Gores loose in Florida and Bill Daley holds the cards.

If you win you get that shiny nation, made of gold, but if you lose, then Al
Gore gets con-trol.

Al Gore opened up his mouth and said ""I'll start this show""

And fire burned in the eyes of lawyers, who knew they'd make some dough.

And he pulled his hand across his lips, and he made an evil grin.

Then in walked all the Palm Beach voters, Dubya's chances were lookin' thin.

(Guitar/bass solo)

When Al Gore finished, Dubya said...

""Well, your pretty good ol' son Now plant your butt in that chair right
there and let me show you how it's done!""

(Chorus II)

Dems in the orange groves, Run George, Run.

You can't lose now in the land of the sun.

Your dads on your side and your brothers' in tow, Gore in the White House,
God, Please NO!

(Fast Fiddle/Guitar solo)

Al Gore bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.

He conceded that golden nation on the Ground at Dubya's feet.

Dubya said, ""Gore, just come on back if ya ever wanna try again, cause I
told you once you tree huggin' dunce, this Texan always wins!""

Rushing Game Matchups???  Here's how I see  the matchups this week.? Please=

note, see the cheatsheet online  http://www.cheatsheets.net/week12sheet.htm=
?
for exactly where I rank players  and to determine who to start.? Just =20
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't=20

info is meant to be just one  more tool in your box when it comes to decidi=

between players.??=20

Locks:? These games heavily favor the  Offense

Tennessee=01,s Eddie George vs Brown  Defense?? Assuming Eddie George can g=
et=20
his  injured toe healthy (and I think he can) he could have a monster game=
=20
against a  Brown Defense that=01,s been terrible against the rush.? For the=
=20
year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB and they=

e=20
Titans will likely be fired up after a stinging loss at home to the  Ravens=

TDs and 155 yards.? At the time, it seemed like a fluke but  Smith has=20
maintained almost that pace since then.? Jay Fiedler and the passing game=
=20
provide  just enough threat to keep the defenses semi honest and Smith does=
=20
the  rest.? Over the last four weeks, the  Jets rank # 26 in rushing yards=
=20
allowed per  game.

New York Giant=01,s Ron Dayne / Tiki  Barber vs Lion Defense?? As you know =
by=20
now, the Giants  running game is governed by how close they keep the game.?=
=20
Coach Jim Fassell abandons the ground  game (especially Ron Dayne=01,s role=
)=20
when the Giants start to trail.? Against a less than explosive Lions  team,=

Prime Matchups:?  These games favor the Offense?

continues his great season against a Falcon team that=01,s playing better r=

tough to  predict.? For the last four weeks,  they rank # 17 in rushing yar=

allowed per game and for the year they come in  at # 14 in Fantasy Points=

=20
last week.? I look for Redmond  and Faulk to have moderate success against=

this improving unit.? Redmond is questionable with ribs so  keep an eye on=

this one.?

Chicago=01,s James Allen vs Buccaneer  Defense?? As with the pass defense,=

                A MESSAGE FROM DON EVANS
               CHAIRMAN, BUSH-CHENEY 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Sunday, November 11, 2000



  Dear Friend,


  This is an urgent message to supporters of Governor George
  W. Bush and Secretary Dick Cheney regarding the situation
  in Florida.

  It is now clear we must raise money to fund the recount
  effort in Florida.  Governor Bush won the vote on Election
  Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, the other
  side is seeking yet a third count by hand.  There is a
  reason why ballots are counted by computer and not by hand.

  The expense of the recount effort must be funded
  immediately.  Please send a check in any amount that you
  can up to $5,000 today. These contributions, in keeping
  with Governor Bush's ""full disclosure"" policy on financial
  contributions, will be posted on the Bush-Cheney website.
  Any funds not spent will be returned on a pro rata basis.

  To contribute, please click here:
  http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf to
  download the Bush-Cheney recount fund reply form. Please
  fill out the form and mail in with your donation.

  We are setting up a site for secure online credit card
  contributions.  As soon as the Web site is available,
  we'll send out an e-mail with the link for online
  contributions.

  Remember:
  1. Checks must be personal, not corporate.
  2. Checks should be payable to Bush-Cheney Recount Fund.
  3. Download and fill out this form:
     http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf
  4. Mail or overnight check to:
        Donald L. Evans
        301 Congress Avenue
        2nd Floor/Bush-Cheney Recount Fund
        Austin, Texas 78701
  5. These funds do not count against your annual personal
     federal giving limit of $25,000.

  Thank you for your friendship and support.  If you have
  friends that can help, please forward this message to them
  immediately.   We thank you for all that you did to help
  elect Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.  We also thank
  you in advance for your willingness to help us during this
  important time in the life of our country.


  Sincerely,

  Don Evans

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
""accrual value"" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000

I gave this presentation to John Sherriff, Richard Lewis and Joe Gold this 
afternoon - lots of interesting feedback !

Would love to take you through this  - I also took Joel Henenberg through an 
early draft version and suggested we should discuss it on a call with 
yourself and Mary next week.

There are some significant issues arise around Thunderball and Global Markets 
which we have started to discuss with Kevin Swenney and Cindy Horn ( I missed 
my opportunity to take Brent through all the issues this afternoon but will 
try to get to him soon ).

Hope all is well - speak to you soon

277,"I wanted to update you on a few items for the Calgary office.  We have 
continued to recruit for the Risk group.  On Tuesday, August 8, Brian Gillis 
will be starting as a manager in the Risk group.  Brian was previously a 
controller at Koch and was someone that Drew Lynch had tried to recruit 
previously when Brian was at Price Waterhouse.  The expectation for Brian is 
that he will learn our Risk systems and assume some of the leadership role 
for the junior risk employees from Kathy Reeves.  This will get Kathy out of 
the day-to-day risk activities, and allow me to broaden her skill sets 
outside of the Risk area.  Kathy is the best candidate to train as backup for 
me (not that I am planning to leave anytime soon!), so I want her to spend 
some time in the documentation area and eventually logistics.  We are still 
looking for one additional risk person because of the power activities which 
will be significantly increasing by year end.

In the documentation department, I have promoted Dianne Seib to a Lead 
position.  Dianne is very strong and will now assume work direction and 
performance review responsibilities for the eight employees in that 
department.  I have also hired one senior clerk who will start on September 
1st in preparation for the increased power activities.  This will give the 
new person time to train on physical and financial confirmations prior to the 
start up of the power trading.

I will be loaning Chris Wiebe to the IT group for a three-month period to 
work on developmental IT activities.  Many of the departments in Calgary have 
need for higher level excel skills, macros, queries from the various 
databases, development of access databases, etc. that will increase the 
efficiency of our processes.   Chris has a lot of skills in these areas.  
Because we are not sure if this position is a long-term or short-term 
requirement for Calgary, we will put Chris into this role for three months 
and then evaluate the status of the position at that time.  Chris will still 
work part-time in my department particularly with respect to input on the 
next generation systems requirements which are now underway. 

Because of the addition of three risk employees that were not previously 
budgeted for, I will be exceeding my budget for the remainder of the year.  I 
know that Houston is in the same situation, but I wanted to make sure you 
were aware that Calgary will have the same issue.  Both Rob Milnthorp and Jon 
McKay are aware of the situation, and were supportive of the expansion of the 
risk department as they ultimately benefit from this.

I don't know if you've picked any tentative dates for your trip to Calgary, 
but I wanted to let you know that Beth Perlman is also planning a trip up 
this month.  We had tentatively talked about sometime during the week of 
August 21st.  I haven't been able to confirm her final plans as she has been 
on vacation for the past two weeks.

This is my schedule for the remainder of August:

 Vacation;  August 14 - 18
 Customer event: Monday - August 21
 Back office golf tournament - afternoon of August 28th
 Cross-Alta golf tournament - afternoon of August 29th

The back office golf tournament is an annual event and includes all of my 
staff and Laura's and is a lot of fun.  We have a mix of golfers and 
non-golfers so we set it up as a no-pressure scramble tournament.  If you 
want to come on the 28th, we'd be happy to include you in the tournament.

Thanks again for talking to Wes about Laura Scott.  I really appreciate it.  
Just something to think about, since Laura has the client services function 
for Calgary, would it make sense if she reported to you instead of Wes?

Talk to you soon.
Peg

285,"Wes,
As we discussed on Friday, I think that there is merit to your arguments 
regarding the release in prudency in North America.  However, this may alter 
the way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and 
ratings agencies.  De facto, we will be saying that our balance sheet and 
income statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in North 
America at the mid with no adverse effects.  While this may be true, 
typically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more 
liquid portfolios, i.e., they will not believe that we have perfect 
liquidity.  I believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit 
considerations if we maintain an ability to calculate an ""orderly 
liquidation"" under a negative pricing scenario (basically, multiple horizon 
VAR against a liquidating position).  This is what we showed Moody's last 
month.  The main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to p&l 
as opposed to having reserves against it.  This is a long way of saying that 
I think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both RAC 
and Treasury once you have finalized a course of action.

vacation that I took before Christmas.  It was fun to be home with the 
children, although I certainly worked hard -- up every night until very late 
either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas

I should be in the office after lunch.  I plan to be there through Thursday,

I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.  Some of the 
major goals for the trip are:

 to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of 
London books to same  day,

 to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts 
(we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 for managers and above within 
Operations for EA, EGM and EIM),

 to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the 
London office who will participate in  Doorstep reviews this year, 

 to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London 
office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR

I also plan to visit with Mike on the feasibility of utilizing our 
operational pricing model in London and his thoughts on CommodityLogic and 
other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office 
services.  Mike also has some members of the London team that he would like 
for me to meet.  

Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy.  
Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for 
a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this 
week.  

I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.  In addition, 
I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.  Also, if 
you have an opening for lunch or dinner, do let me know.  I have been in the

302,"As many of you know, The University of Texas has its most significant 
fundraising effort underway.  As a part of that effort, the Red McCombs 
School of Business is trying to raise $130 million which will help it to 
achieve its goal to become the next great business school in the world.  
Obviously, the Red McCombs gift of $50 million (the largest ever contributed 
to the University) is a big part of that effort.  However, much more is 
needed and will only be achieved through participation by a significant 
number of alumni and friends of the University.

On Tuesday, February 6th at 2 pm, Dean Bob May of the McCombs School will be 
at the Enron Building to meet with us about the School's plans and how we can 
participate.  I am organizing this meeting for Bob and inviting all Enron 
officers that are UT alumni.  This should be a very informal meeting with 
relatively few attendees (hopefully around 25 people).  It will give you a 
chance to get to know Bob, what is going on at the Business School and how 
you can participate. Make no mistake.  We hope the result is that you decide 
to support the effort.  There is a unique opportunity to participate at this 
time because, in addition to matching funds from Enron, the McCombs gift 
provides for additional matching funds for contributions of a certain level.  
I have found that this matching provides a real opportunity to make endowment 
level gifts.

Enron and the McCombs School have a great partnership.  The company has made 
a significant commitment to the school's programs, we have a very significant 
presence on campus through our activities and support from administration and 
faculty, and we have enjoyed great success recruiting for a number of years.  
However, Enron has never successfully organized its alumni giving in a way 
which would allow for even greater Enron support and presence while 
optimizing each individual's contribution.  I am hopeful that as a group of 
Enron officers, we can set the example of coordinated giving.

Please plan to attend the meeting.  It will be held in the Board Room on 50, 
last about an hour and refreshments will be served.  Please let me or Sharron 
Westbrook (extension 37094)  know if you can attend.  Thanks. ","Dean Bob Bob Sharron

center has been really busy and I needed to contact them to get some of the 
questions answered from the meeting.  For those of you who were unable to 
attend, I have listed the topics of discussion:

Goals for Wellesley - Hiring goal of 4 (not limited to)
Analyst Program changes - Structure ( Team Leaders), Developmental Program, 2 
day interview process
Interview Training Workshop - Everyone that will be interviewing is required 
to attend a 2 hour session
Roles and Responsibilities - Role of team members, Participation is tracked 
for PRC recognition.
Wellesley Campus Plan
 - We discussed the presentation time being pushed back.  I was able to get 
it pushed back to 5:00  o'clock at the latest.  There are other companies 
scheduled to present on that date and that was the  latest time we coud get.  
There will be no class conflicts on that date (September 28, 2000).   We  
discussed the attire for the presentation being casual (jeans).  That concept 
was  proposed to the  career placement center Assistant (Bernice Tita) and 
she said that casual attire will be well received.   We would need to just 
indicate it when we publicize the event.
 - We discussed changing the interview dates due to scheduling conflicts.  
The dates that we were  able to get were November 20th and 21st. 
 - We discussed possible recruiting at neighboring schools(Smith & Mt. Holy 
Oke)
 - We discussed taking the company jet to some or all the events, especially 
when we will be   involving recruiting efforts at the neighboring schools.
Target Groups -  Economic Student Board Association, All majors

I meet today with a representative of the Aust Financial Markets Assoc (AFMA) 
to look at a system they have developed called SCOR: Standards for the 
Control of Operational Risk. It is essentially a complex set of procedures 
for identifying and managing operational risk. The idea is to use it to 
benchmark and develop in written form your own control procedures. 

I have a presentation pack and I think this would be worth our subscribing: 
cost is $US5 500 for 3 years, but I was wondering:

1. Who would be the right person in Houston/London to go through this with - 
if that is required 
2. Am I re-inventing the wheel and do we have detailed written procedures all 
ready. 

Any feedback would be great. Another point to note that may be of interest:

To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.

Just as a follow up to our conversation, I have serious concerns about the estate's ability to service IT requests.  The number of people that remain in the estate, that understand the gas and power systems, is limited (and we're receiving resignations now).  With this in mind, I would like to have the ability to outsource the IT department (applications, infrastructure) and potentially the back office staff to a consulting company (potentially Accenture or CGEY).  We would need to move the estate employees into this company and incentivize them to stay.  The consulting company could then supplement the staff and the Enron estate employees could now have a career path at the consulting company. 

To make this deal attractive, the consulting company would like to have the ability to create a services company and offer IT and fulfillment and processing services to other companies.  By the way, this could be done for other commodities outside gas and power.  The deal would have to include royalty payments to the estate for each additional services agreement.  The intent is to make the services company into a thriving business.  We would also want to sell Commodity Logic (IP included) to round out the services offering.  We could consider selling the IP to our EGM and EIM systems as well.

All in all, the intent is to bring value to the estate and support the estate while the businesses wind down or start up.  We must make sure that the NETCO agreement allows the estate to license the gas and power software in some capacity and continue to develop the applications.

As an aside, the estate cannot perform on the Bridgeline or AEP deals.  There are not enough resources that fully understand the system, therefore, we cannot maintain a fully operational production quality system.  These deals must either be moved to NETCO or we need to find another alternative (the above referenced services company or selling the software to AEP and Bridgeline).

I know this is long winded, but I needed to get these points down on paper.

I am on vacation next week, but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-240-0919 or at my house in Kiawah at 843-768-6651.  I'll also have my Blackberry but reception is poor on the island!

336,"This mail is the third in the series regarding the acceptance of RiskTrac VaR for UK Power. Please see the previous 2 days which will provide the history.

Essentially we have now reached the stage where we can explain the jump in VaR from moving from the VaR spread sheet to RiskTrac based largely on the good work that Fergus Trenholme - London Risk Management and Stig Faltinsen - London Research have done  (it has been a team effort as many others have been called in as appropriate and I would like to thank them too).

A full analysis is contained in the note from Fergus and Stig below but the key points to note are:

the changing of the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VAR number between the 2 systems but not completely (including the change in factor loadings)
the vast majority of the difference in the VAR numbers between the 2 systems is caused by the splitting of the volumetric position into the (primary and secondary) component curves in RiskTrac. In RiskTrac PPP is currently set as the primary curve even though 75% of the position is on the station gate curve where as in the spreadsheet the whole position is against the PPP curve

As a result of us now being able to isolate and explain the jump in VaR from moving to RiskTrac we will be reporting this number from now on. That said does the VaR number sound right ? The numer is theoretically but is the theory close to reality in the Uk Power market ?The RiskTrac calculated $25m VaR is a 1 day VaR and the  methodology would imply it should be broken 1 in 20 business days. Based on historical P&Ls this has not been the case and so it does not pass the ""sense check"". (note that the original $13m VaR was only broken once or twice in the last year).

There are many potential explanations why, but if we think about how the price and volatility curves move they typically only move at the short end (ie only the first 2 years) and the component VarR for this period is in the order of $8m. This could therefore imply that the volatilities we are using to calculate the VaR are too high. The book undoubtedly contains significant risk but due to market illiquidity more consideration should be given to ""jumps"" or ""shocks"".  The book does posses increased fat tail risk at this lower VaR level which is not  captured in the current VaR calculation.

Outstanding issues / work

Based on the second bullet point above consideration needs to be given to changing the primary and secondary curve settings as well as the correlations and factor loadings for and between all the curves. The impact of any such changes will need to be quantified. Fergus and Stig aim to work with Houston research and the business on this over the next few days / week(s) and will be providing a regular update to those on this mail list.

Additional work needs to done to assess whether the VaR  number  / methodology being calculated / employed by RiskTrac truly represents the expected volatility and performance of the portfolio and truly represents the 1 day earnings risk for 19 out of 20 days. It would also be appropriate, given the nature of the market and the term structure of the portfolio, to assess the fat tail risk being run.

I am away for the next 2 weeks so Fergus and Stig will be sending regular progress updates.

347,"I have not personally talked to James about these issues in Enpower.  His 
concerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate.  IT is currently 
working on new volatility curves for swaptions to use.  IT is also working on 
correlations in order for asian options to be valued properly.  London trades 
many more swaptions and asian options than the US; therefore, the impact of 
not having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them.  
The majority of options in the U.S. are European monthly and daily exercises 
and the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals.  The 
idea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the US, but other 
more material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal 
specific volatilities for the swaptions we do have.  Once the technology is 
in place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt.   The system was 
originally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the US 
and as new markets and new ideas (such as the US becoming more and more of a 
financial market) we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit.  Swaption 
vols and asian options are two of these enhancements. 

Also, it is difficult to get option data out of Enpower.  We have in stage an 
option sensitivity matrix that, once implemented into production. I will be 
sure that James knows about.  It probably will not solve all his problems, 
but it will give him a starting place.

Thank you again for passing my resume to Ted Murphy. His recruiter is trying
to work the scheduling between myself and the six people that Ted wants me
to meet with. It is all very positive and I appreciate all your help.

I am also very interested in Enron Broadband Services on the commercial
side. With my options and structuring background, I believe that it would be
a great fit. What would be the best way to get my resume in front of Ken
Rice or the right person in his group? I am attaching an electronic copy for
easy forwarding.

Thank you

Associates PRC.  I do need a break!  

I will be working the week after Christmas.  Although we do have a holiday on 
December 26th, we will trading that day.  Lots of my logistics and risk guys 
will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day.  I will be in for 
full days on the 27th -29th.  Very few commitments on the calendar for those

fly to Bermuda from Texas.  Easy from New York, but not that much traffic 
between Houston/Austin and there.  A few years ago when we went with David's 
family to Yellowstone, we were able to get a great deal through Continental 
through their group rate department. That works when you travel with a group 
of 10 or more, all on the same itinerary.  I think that our round trip from 
Salt Lake to Houston was $235 each.  Hopefully we could arrange something 
like that.   If airfare is more like $1,000 between here and Bermuda, that 
could be tough.  

Should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or 
three and rank them?  Then we could check on accomodations, airfare, deals, 
etc. to see what would be most feasible.  Or should we research a few places 
and present those choices for them to consider?  What do you think?  Seems 
like there will be 13 of us, counting baby White/Lowrimore.  And what do you

 ",Audrey Lynn,,
411,"	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

                           Learn the ins and outs of filing after mid-April 
deadline 

                           By GARY KLOTT 
                           Tribune Media 

                           For the many millions of individuals who have yet 
to file their 2000 income tax returns, there is no
                           reason to panic. 

                           If you need more time to file your return, you can 
easily get a filing extension. 

                           And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now, 
you can buy more time to pay up. While you may be
                           subject to interest and penalties for payments 
made after April 16, you can put off the day of
                           reckoning for months without fear that IRS 
collection agents will come after you. There is even a
                           loophole in the law that will enable many 
individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being
                           assessed interest or penalties. 

                           Nevertheless, April 16 is a critical deadline for 
anyone who has yet to file his tax returns. You'll need
                           to file either your tax return or an extension 
request by the deadline. And to avoid interest and
                           penalties, you'll generally need to pay any taxes 
owed by April 16. 

                           April 16 is also the deadline for making IRA 
contributions for 2000 returns and for making the first
                           installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 2001. 

                           Filing extension: If you'd like more time to file 
your return, getting a filing extension is simple. In fact,
                           the IRS has expanded the options this year for 
obtaining a filing extension. You can now do it by
                           phone, computer or mail. 

                           The traditional way to get an extension is to fill 
out IRS Form 4868, ""Application for Automatic
                           Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income 
Tax Return"" and mail it to the IRS by the April 16
                           deadline. If you're using tax-preparation software 
or a tax professional, you can file your extension
                           request by computer. Or you can phone in your 
extension request by calling 888-796-1074. 

                           If you owe the IRS money, another option for 
requesting an extension is to make the payment by
                           credit card (American Express, Discover or 
MasterCard) on the Internet or by phone through one
                           of the two companies the IRS has authorized for 
processing credit card payments. Details on the
                           option are included in the Form 4868 instructions. 

                           By making the extension request, the IRS will 
automatically give you four more months, until Aug.
                           15, to file your return. 

                           You can get an extension for any reason. No 
explanation is asked for when requesting an extension. 

                           But be aware that your extension request only 
gives you extra time to file your return, not to pay
                           your taxes. To avoid interest and possible penalty 
charges, you must estimate how much you owe
                           and make the payment with your extension request 
by the April 16 deadline. 

                           Unable to pay: If you can't afford to pay your tax 
bill, you should at least file an extension request by
                           the April 16 deadline. 

                           Though you'll be subject to interest and possible 
penalty charges for late payment of your taxes,
                           you'll avoid being hit with a late-filing penalty, 
which runs a steep five percent a month (up to a
                           maximum 25 percent.) 

                           Installment plan: If you still don't have the cash 
to pay your taxes by the time your extension runs out
                           on Aug. 15, you can negotiate with the IRS to pay 
your balance due in monthly installments. You
                           make the request for an installment agreement when 
you file your completed tax return using Form
                           9465, ""Installment Agreement Request."" 

                           ""Offer in compromise"": If you can't afford to pay 
all you owe in taxes, even in installments over a
                           period of years, you may be able to work out a 
settlement with the IRS. The IRS recently expanded
                           its ""Offer in Compromise"" program, in which 
taxpayers in tough financial situations can offer to settle
                           for less than they owe. Offers are submitted using 
IRS Form 656, ""Offer in Compromise."" 

                           A loophole offers an extra month to pay up: If all 
you need is an extra month or so to come up with
                           the cash to pay your tax bill, there is a way you 
may be able to get a short reprieve without being
                           subject to interest or penalties. 

                           All you need do is take the IRS up on its offer to 
calculate your tax bill for you. 

                           If you're eligible for the offer, fill out your 
tax return, stopping short of computing certain totals, and
                           send it in by April 16. The IRS will compute your 
tax and send you a bill for any tax owed. If you
                           pay within 30 days of the notice, you won't be 
assessed any penalties or interest. 

                           To take advantage of the loophole, your taxable 
income must be less than $100,000 and you can't
                           itemize deductions. The full list of eligibility 
requirements and step-by-step instructions are contained
                           in IRS Publication 967, ""The IRS Will Figure Your 
Tax."" 

                           Retirement account contributions: If you hope to 
contribute to an Individual Retirement Account, the
                           final deadline for 2000 tax-year contributions is 
April 16, even if you obtain a filing extension. 

                           The deadline is more flexible for self-employed 
retirement plans. Contributions to Keogh or
                           Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans can be 
made up until the due date of your return, which
                           can be later than April 16 with a filing 
extension. 

                           Estimated tax deadline: For self-employed workers 
and other individuals who need to make
                           quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS, April 
16 also is the deadline for making the first
                           installment for 2001. ",GARY KLOTT Keogh,"less than $100,000",Tribune Media IRS American Express MasterCard

Agree with Dave as below

Seems the mindset should be to sell everything. Scott plans to turn Mariner into a GOM Shelf company after he sells off the deepwater.

I don't see why the ""Basin"" team (who were just put on contract to pursue a Shelf strategy) need an extension. Presumably Mariner isn't going to have a Shelf play going forward (and don't have a Shelf position to preserve).

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Standard & Poor's and RiskMetrics to Develop Integrated Credit Risk Product

 
Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions and the RiskMetrics Group today announced plans to integrate two of their credit risk products 
 
The two firms will build an interface between Standard & Poor's CreditModel?, an Internet-accessible credit scoring model for public and private firms, and RiskMetrics' CreditManager, a credit portfolio risk measurement, analysis and reporting tool.  The interface will allow customers to access CreditModel? analytics and generate obligor credit scores directly from within CreditManager. 
 
CreditModel? is a series of industry and region specific credit scoring models that give users the ability to quickly and easily generate high quality evaluations of an organization's creditworthiness. While not actual credit ratings, the scores reflect Standard & Poor's credit analysis experience in each sector.


CreditManager is a stand-alone application for the measurement and analysis of portfolio Value-at-Risk (VaR) due to credit events including upgrades, downgrades and defaults. CreditManager implements the industry standard CreditMetrics? methodology and enables banks, fund managers and other financial institutions to consolidate credit risk across their entire organizations.

456,"FYI - per Rod Hayslett and Stan Horton, Ken Lay and Skilling were recently ""shocked"" to be told that PGE's regulated price risk management activities were going to lose ~$53MM in the 3rd quarter.  Rod said they hadn't realized before this the level of market risk that PGE is exposed to.  Evidently PGE is required to have excess supply to meet their projected load requirements, and they're losing $$ on price moves.  Rod said Stan suggested having a conference call with Rick Buy to discuss, so I told Rod to first let you get familiar with the issue.  

You'll probably want to be familiar with it since we're recommending a $10MM limit on the Regulated Portfolio, and it's losing $$$.  We're simply imposing a limit on existing risk, but given the significant drop in PGE earnings vs. prior year, Investor Relations is expecting some interest and the BOD might be aware of it and ask for clarification of our risk management practices accordingly.

Regards,
Cassandra.


PGE 3Q IBIT/Sensitivity to power prices

INTERNAL SUMMARY
?	PGE buys power in advance of its needs to allow for load and reliability balancing beyond their generation capabilities.  PG&E is typically long 200-300 average megawatts.  These positions are typically entered into 1 to 2 years in advance.  The excess positions are sold in the spot (hourly) market.
?	PGE benefited during the 3rd and 4th quarters 2000 by selling into high prices.  As a precaution against prices falling, they instituted a cost adjustment mechanism with ranges for cost sharing based on total power costs.  In 2Q01, PGE entered an unfavorable range of the sharing mechanism, where they bear 100% of the upside/downside within a range.  As a result of downward trending power pricing and the cost of power outpacing the sharing under the arrangement, PGE IBIT may be flat/slightly negative for 3Q01.
?	On 10/1/01, a new cost mechanism begins.  PGE expects to meet internal target of $110M for 2001, based on YTD performance and additional adjustment mechanisms, which are being executed for 4Q01 and into 2002.

BACKGROUND
?	The methodology for the current 9-month mechanism is as follows:
o	A band with a ceiling and a floor has been negotiated on a quarterly and a cumulative basis for the nine-month period.
     Total Costs			PGE/Customer
$140M to $211M 			100% PGE (deadband)
      $211M to $232M 			50%/50% 
      Above $232M			10%/90%
?	At 6/30/01, PGE was in the 100% PGE band, ($105M), but did not significantly impact the financials as this amount was sufficient to cover power generation costs.)
?	It is expected that the 9 mo. total costs will rise to $325M, which will potentially expose PGE for approx. $35MM (comprised of 100% of the risk of the deadband to the extent that total costs to be recovered are lower than increases in the costs of power, 50% of the risk between $211MM to $232MM and 10% of exposure above $232MM.)
?	To reduce the exposure for fourth quarter 2001 and 2002, PG&E is in the process of finalizing a similar cost adjustment mechanism for a 15-month period ending December 31, 2002.  The structure mechanism will have additional features:
o	A tighter band than the 2001 mechanism
o	Tiers of sharing, with less sharing as the variance between forecasted power costs and actual power costs is larger, positive or negative.
o	Forecasted power costs set using actual reservoir levels, and expected rainfall, significantly reducing forecasted available hydro
o	PG&E will file the forecasted power costs on or around August 15, reflecting trades and purchases through the end of July

476,"Mike I wanted to give a short update on the latest events related to the PCB 
issue with PG&E.  Transwestern met with PG&E this last Wednesday with an 
agenda that included some sharing of sampling results collected downstream of 
their first C/S (Topock) and on out west toward their main distribution 
areas.  With respect to the most recent sampling data, Low PCB concentrations 
(N.D. to 38 ppm) have been detected in drips and interconnects between Topock 
and Hinckley C/S.  The good news is that PCB's have not been detected 
downstream of Hinckley which is approx. 160 miles from the Topock C/S.  PG&E 
has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small 
separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly 
into customers.  the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter 
separators is still on target for 6/1/00.

Now for the bad news.  At the conclusion of the meeting, PG&E has stated that 
they want their Topock C/S decontaminated.  This includes all piping and 
equipment.  I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of 
removing all the PCB's from their system and that there would be no 
quarantees that the deconning would be successful.   The contract PCB 
deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 
ug.  They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that 
in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas 
continues to move through the system.  Additionally, the better remediation 
approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic 
locations.  Even with this, they were pretty insistent that their management 
wanted the facility cleaned.  Preliminary $$ estimates range to approx. 3-5 
million.

I think that this is only the ""tip of the iceberg"".  If they are successful 
with this action, the pipeline system will be next.  Their pipeline is not 
piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe, valves etc.

the following:
 
  PCB's are a contaminant, just as benzene is, which occurs naturally in the 
gas.  Health issues of PCBs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a  
customer and employee standpoint (the name PCB lends itself to public outcry 
of the unknown)

 Removal of PCB's is best accomplished by managing liquids, not deconing

suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows:

 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 
2-10.84 drip locations

The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above 
PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000.  

I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their 
C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs 
to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision 
is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done 
during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also 
need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology 
to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes 
to 36"".

there are some internal problems with this program and the third party 
contractors which are on their ""list"".  At this stage of the game, they 
recommended that we do not resort to this alternative as most of the work 
that the contractor would do has been done by the ADEQ allready.  I then 
indicated that I would be contacting the Director of the ADEQ about the 
urgency of this multi million dollar project and the benefits to the state of 
Arizona.  The permit engineer thought that would be a good idea. Because we 
will be permitting through this agency again for Sundevil, and dont want to 
upset the agency cart, I am going to speak with the permit engineers 
supervisor and then to the Director of the ADEQ next week about either an 
accelerated issuance of the permit or more realistically, allowance to do 
some construction activities while the ADEQ is completing the review and 
permit writing.  This way, I wont step on any toes.  By the way, the ADEQ 
said that they dont consider this to be a PSD issue.  The following time line 
for permit issuance under the Arizona laws at this stage appears to be: 
another 2-3 weeks to write the permit, one month by the ADEQ technical staff 
to do the required internal review and then the  EPA is given a one month 
period to do their review, which is requried by the EPA for all class 1

Attached is a summary table showing the inspection types and intervals
required by 49 CFR 195 and 40 CFR 60.  49 CFR 195 is a DOT regulation that
references API 653 for affected tanks.  There are no exemptions for age or
size.  The DOT inspections focus on physical integrity of the tank to
prevent catostrophic failure.  The 40 CFR rules are aimed at emissions and
these do have age and size limitations.  Let me know if this is satisfactory
or if you need anything else.

Drafts of the 1999 and 2000 annual reports for your CESA MOU are attached 
for  
your use (Wordperfect). There are two outstanding issues regarding the 1999  
report. After speaking with Ed Attanasio, it appears that the Letter of  
Credit issued in 1999 may have expired in 2000 without habitat being  
purchased. This letter of credit either needs to be reestablished or habitat  
needs to be purchased to offset these disturbances. In addition, I do not  
have a copy of evidence that the Coles Levee credits were purchased (for the  
one Coles Levee project in 1999). 

Regarding habitat compensation: 1) Credits can be purchased from Coles 
Levee.  
They must be purchased at Coles Levee for projects on the preserve. For  
outside projects, CDFG and USFWS must approve purchase of these credits on  
case-by-case. 2) Credits can be purchased from Kern Water Bank. Again, USFWS  
and CDFG must concur that credits at Kern Water Bank are appropriate  
compensation for projects on a case-by-case basis. 

Your other source of credits is tied to the land around the NCL gas plant.  
However, as you may have seen by the letter from CDFG that I faxed, EOTT  
still has some negotiating to do with CDFG to put this option in place. Gary  
and I met with CDFG in December regarding this issue. They would like some  
kind of MOU between the parties. At the time, Gary did not think that the 
MOU  
could be completed and signed before Rogas was to begin and decided to work  
on the MOU to cover subsequent projects. 

May I suggest purchasing the needed compensation credits at the same time as  
the Rogas credits are purchased. With Kern Water Bank, there is a $5000 
admin  
fee each time credits are purchased. I don't know what the current charge is  
a Coles Levee. 

Please call me if you have any questions.

520,"As per your request, an environmental due diligence was completed of the 
assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a 
local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in 
Portand, Oregon.  This  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9, 
2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures 
which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the 
environmental risks associated with each issue.  A relative risk number 
between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential 
risk impact.  A rating of ""0"" indicates that there is no risk associated with 
this regulation or issue and a rating of ""3"" indicates a major problem or an 
issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.  An approximate cost  
value has also been assigned to each discipline.   It is to be understood and 
explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative 
estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or 
formally close each issue. 

Presented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact 
and affect NWNG.  The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is 
based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG 
personnel.  Therefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of 
information presented.

General Pipeline Characteristics ;

This is a dry pipeline system.  No pipeline liquids are generated, only small 
volumes of compressor oils are collected.
All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.  There is still approx. 
100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future.  
The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage, 
and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity). 
this is a non Title V major source.
NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their 
underground storage capacity. 
NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of 
2002.  All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the 
agencies.
Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.  NWNG has 
completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas.    

Environmental Procedures Manual.   The NWNG environmental procedures manual  
appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.  The topics 
covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company 
appeared to be involved with.  The manual addressed waste management, 
permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.  There was also a written 
statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to 
enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG. 
Risk: 0  Cost: $0

Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).   In a summary 
page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against 
the company was available.  Although the company had received a few  notices 
(<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small 
recordkeeping and right of way issues.  There were no outstanding judgements, 
NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved.  
Risk: 0  Cost: $0 

PCBs.  In interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have 
never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected.  
Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company, 
the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown.
Risk:  1  Cost: $0        

Mercury.   Mercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and 
not in natural gas metering equipment.  A decision was made by environmental 
management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.  An investigation 
has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers 
or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment 
which may have been used. 
Risk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000

Onsite Disposal.  Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas 
plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not 
aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous 
waste.
Risk:   1  Cost:   undefined

Hazardous Waste.  There is only one location where hazardous waste is 
generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is 
used.  This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity 
generator.  The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous 
waste.
Risk: 0  Cost:  0 

NORMS.  The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually 
occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline 
system.  Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does 
NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company.
Risk:  1  Cost:  $500

Underground Storage Tanks (UST).  There is only one regulated underground 
storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in 
complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and 
recordkeeping.  All other underground tanks have been removed.  At one of the 
tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.  Closure 
of this site is expected in the near future.
Risk: 1  Cost: $500

LNG plants.  In interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no 
histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural 
gas (LNG)  plants.  The exception to this is a historic site of a 
manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.  This 
issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas 
Plant. 
Risk: 0  Cost:  $0

Manufactured Gas Plants.  NWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured 
gas plants (MGPs).  Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had 
operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks.

 Eugene Water and Electrical Board. The City of Eugene has determined that  a 
parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous 
responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time 
period of 1958-1976.  The Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is 
the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean 
the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has 
indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.  NWNG has offered to pay 
compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all 
liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City 
of Eugene.   The environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB 
has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately 
$94,000.
 Risk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000

 Salem Site. According to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been 
remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the   
regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.  NWNG has received 
endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature.  
 Risk: 1   Cost: $0

 Manufactured Gas Plant. This site, which ceased operation in the early 
1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.  From the time the facility ceased  
operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail 
bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park.  
The site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial 
watercourse in Oregon.  There have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river 
sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts.  
NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds 
of  London.  The insurance policies were not available at the time of this 
due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this 
site.
 Risks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000

Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Environmetnal Protection Agency has 
determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received 
contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify 
the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.  This superfund site extends 
for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites, 
originally owned by NWNG.  The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary 
responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the 
contamination of this section of the Willamette River.  NWNG has been 
identified as a contributing member to the contamination.

 Linnton MGP/Wacker Site.   The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of 
water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland 
Harbor Superfund Site.  The Linnton facility, which originally included the 
Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956.   
During the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar 
wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non  
aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.  Characteristically these 
waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and 
cyanide.  During the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were 
originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in  
1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.  Preliminary 
investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility 
operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil 
underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6 
million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.   It was also estimated from these 
reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed 
with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds.  

 Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more 
years.  NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of 
London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion 
of this superfund responsibility.  The policies were not availble during the 
due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.  Additionally, 
because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the 
subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not 
been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be 
evaluated.   It  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate 
extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance 
coverage  appears to be somewhat premature. 
 Risk:  3  Cost:  $50,000,000-300,000,000

521,"As an update to many of you, I have been on the phone with Roger Kohn of EPA
Region 9 a couple of different times today.  It turns out that what they
really were expecting to see was something more like a formal Biological
Assessment (BA) for CS 3 and CS 4, not a biological survey report like we
provided.  According to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the lead Federal
agency in a Federal Action is responsible for preparing the BA, but a BA is
typically only required when the action ""may affect"" a listed species, which
is not the case here.  EPA Region 9, and based on our experience across the
country, apparently only Region 9, is interpreting their responsibilities
under the ESA very strictly and somewhat ""oddly.""  Regardless, the bottom
line is that it appears we could argue with them ad nauseum and still end up
right back here.  So, we have begun working very quickly and diligently to
put together a ""BA-like"" document that, according to Roger, will give them
what they need to put in their files to cover themselves for satisfying the
ESA.

I told him that the USFWS typically (under ""normal"" circumstances) receives
a BA from the lead federal agency and then issues their Biological Opinion
(BO).  I asked him if they (EPA) were going to still feel like they needed
any kind of concurrence from the USFWS.  He said that only if we were going
to have any findings of ""may affect"" would they maybe feel the need to get
additional concurrence from the USFWS.  I told him that you (Larry) already
have a verbal concurrence from USFWS that there are no issues, in addition
to the fact that our surveys confirmed that.  I told him that our ""BA-like""
document is going to come to the same conclusions that our Survey Report did
(i.e., No Effect).  He said that he understands, and will likely just
receive the document, assure himself that it says what it needs to say, and
is formatted in the manner he feels it needs to be formatted, put it in his
files, and put out the Public Notice for a 30-day comment period.  If this
all happens by early next week, we should still have permits by the
beginning of November. I will continue to hammer home the importance of that
schedule.  Some of us will be on a conference call with Roger and one of the
EPA attorneys tomorrow to try to ""get inside their heads"" a little bit
better regarding why they are the only Region interpreting their ESA
responsibilities so strictly.  We will debrief you after the call.  Scott

1.  EPA did not include the stain tube request for sulfur monitoring.  The 
methods that are currently listed are wet chemistry methods.  As we 
discussed, since the permit allows us to use an APPROVED, alternate method, 
we will need to submit this request at some time.  For the time being, since 
we want to receive this permit ASAP we should be able to accept the permit as 
is.

523,"I spoke with Eduardo Acosta at the TNRCC.  He has stated that if a turbine
is not subject to any NSPS or 30 TAC 117 requirements you don't have to list
them on an OP-UA form.  I've prepared the renewals with an OP-UA11 form that
makes a negative Subpart GG applicability statement.  However, if you prefer
I can remove these forms.  Having the forms in the permit makes it clear to
an inspector that the turbine is ""grandfathered"" from GG.  What is your
preference?

Since it's been two months since we have heard from you we wanted to check 
back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help you with your 
diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an informed decision 
that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own 
these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find 
the very best diamond for you at a great price.

Since you have not responded to any of our emails these past 8 weeks, we 
assume you are no longer shopping for a diamond and will remove your name 
from our active customer list.  We hope that if you are still shopping you 
will contact us so we can help you find a great diamond.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Last month I produced a BAWG Status Report presentation for the April 24,
2001 BIC meeting but unfortunately was not able to give that presentation
""in-person"" because of a scheduling conflict with a sub-working group
meeting to discuss metering for the EDRP.  This status report is available
on the NYISO Web Site under April 24 BIC Meeting Materials and it is my
understanding that Garry Brown directed market participants to read that
presentation and contact Wes Yeomans or attend a BAWG meeting with
questions.

pertaining to direction on what to use for generation payments when the
NYISO orders a generator on line but the generator bid price expired.

Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air 
permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to 
ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information 
required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a 
September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that 
energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I 
phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept 
aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, 
both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we 
approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were 
conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional 
time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else 
could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure 
that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.",John Phil Transwestern  ,,Redrock EPA State

The following contains a summary of  high-level employment/labor issues based 
upon the review of the documents in the data room here in Houston.  We still 
need to have a conference call with the HR team at GP to ascertain the 
climate of labor relations and other employment issues.

Woodland

1.  Employment Claims:  In the list of insurance matters, there are several 
employment-related claims.  Those include sexual harassment allegations, 
disability discrimination, retaliation, and mistreatment.  It is unclear 
whether those are ongoing claims or not.  I would question whether the mill 
has had harassment prevention training, and if so, when.  Also, are there 
other employment claims that are not identified in the documents?    

2. Labor Union matters:  Rick Johnson is going to review the collective 
bargaining agreements.   I am waiting on a list of union grievances, which is 
supposed to be forwarded to me today.

3.  I saw nothing about employment contracts, change of control agreements, 
or other documents that may require a buyer to provide benefits after closing 
for either Woodland.

Leaf River 

1.  Litigation Summary:  The company provided a summary of litigation.  Three 
of the four are personal injury claims -- one is a fall down stairs by a 
delivery person (settled on 7/14/00); another is a contract employee who was 
injured when a propane truck on a forklift exploded in his face, and the 
third is another contract employee who fell down some stairs (settled 
7/27/00).  The fourth is a race discrimination claim from 1991, which has 
been on hold due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy.  The summary states that the 
corporate law department has more details about the personal injury claims.  
We may want to obtain more detailed information as we proceed in this 
transaction.  Are there other litigation matters or pending claims?  (E.g., 
EEOC).

2.  No employment contracts.  I saw nothing about change of control 
agreements or other documents that may require a buyer to provide 
post-closing payments.

3.  Workers Comp:  There are several workers comp claims for 1999 and 1998.  
I would suggest that our risk/insurance groups review these claims to make 
sure that they are not unusual.

Dee Lenfest is going to review the material on employee benefits and should 
provide a separate analysis on that topic.

We are pleased to announce the following organizational changes:

Enron Global Assets and Services

In order to increase senior management focus on our international businesse=
s, we are creating a new business unit, Enron Global Assets and Services (E=
GAS).  EGAS will be led by Kevin Hannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Jim H=
ughes, Chief Operating Officer.  Kevin will report to the Enron Corp. Offic=
e of the Chairman.  With the exception of the Wessex Water Company (which w=
ill remain in the Enron Transportation Services organization) and Enron Ind=
ia (discussed below), EGAS will include all of the assets and activities of=
 the former Enron Global Assets group and the Azurix organization.  EGAS wi=
ll include Enron's assets and merchant activities in South America.  In ord=
er to ensure continuity in the management of our South American merchant bu=
siness, John Lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities=
.  John will report to Kevin Hannon with respect to the South American merc=
hant business, and will continue to report to the Enron Wholesale Services =
Office of the Chairman for all other activities in his role as Chief Execut=
ive Officer of Enron Americas.

Enron India

Enron's significant interests in India are commanding increased attention f=
rom Enron's senior management.  We are pleased to announce that Rebecca McD=
onald will focus exclusively on Enron's business in India, as Chief Executi=
ve Officer of Enron India, reporting to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chair=
man.

Enron Broadband Services

With Kevin's departure from Enron Broadband Services (EBS), we are also mak=
ing a number of changes in the EBS organization.  Jim Fallon will now be Pr=
esident and Chief Operating Officer of EBS.  Paul Racicot, Marcello Romano =
and Fred Cohagan will maintain their EBS risk management activities within =
their respective regions.  Dave Cox will continue as Chief Commercial Offic=
er of EBS and will also join Ken Rice and Jim Fallon in the EBS Office of t=
he Chairman.  Finally, Rick Fehl will continue as Vice President of Network=
 Engineering and Chief Network Officer but will now report to the EBS Offic=
e of the Chairman.


Enron Principal Investments

In order to better develop and manage equity investment opportunities relat=
ed to Enron's core businesses, we are combining the existing investment gro=
ups in ENA, EBS, Enron Investment Partners and the Enron Special Asset Grou=
p into a single unit, Enron Principal Investments.  Enron Principal Investm=
ents will work with all Enron business units to identify, execute, and mana=
ge equity investments that leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledg=
e.  These investments may be in the form of venture capital, leveraged buy-=
outs, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.  This new b=
usiness unit will be headed by Kevin Garland, Managing Director, and will r=
eport to an investment committee consisting of Dave Delainey, Ken Rice, and=
 Greg Whalley.=20

Enron Corporate Development

In order to improve coordination of Enron's corporate development activitie=
s, we are consolidating these activities under Andy Fastow, Executive Vice =
President and Chief Financial Officer.  Jeff Donahue, Managing Director of =
Corporate Development for EBS will now head Corporate Development across En=
ron.  Corporate Development leaders in the business units will have a dual =
reporting relationship to their business units and to Jeff.

One of Enron's most compelling challenges is the sale of certain assets or =
businesses that are no longer core operations.  Mark Metts, Executive Vice =
President of Enron Corp., will head up a new Special Projects group to spec=
ifically focus on the completion of some of these more challenging transact=

I received the schedule and itinerary for diligence on Project Crane and have 
forwarded it to Rick Johnson, Fran Mayes, Pat Mackin, and Dee Lenfest.

We have preliminarily decided that Rick Johnson will go to both sites to 
cover Labor (union) issues and support in the general HR diligence that Fran 
Mayes of ENA HR will conduct.  Either Pat or Dee will travel to Washington to 
address benefits issues, including obtaining information for subsequent 
modeling of benefit costs.  We would like to have our outside counsel in 
Canada conduct the benefits diligence in the Quebec City location and to 
support Rick to the extent that there may be any special issues of Canadian 
or Quebec law.   I will continue to coordinate these activities and provide 
whatever other assistance may be needed.

Let me know if you need any other information about this diligence plan for 
employment/labor matters.  I will work with Peter Del Vecchio to identify our 
outside counsel designee.

611,"The contents of this email are privileged and confidential.

Below is a quick summary of the general guidance provided by Mark Stubley during the conference call today.  If you have questions, please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-6401.

IBEW, Pipefitters, and others have tried to ""salt"" jobs down there in Florida.

The business agents will try to get out early and visit with the site manager to get a pre-hire agreement, if possible.  The business managers will take notes/keep diaries of their conversations with site managers and supervisors, so be aware of that possibility when you are approached by unions.  We should keep our own notes of conversations as they occur.

Should we designate one person to handle union relations?  We should have a very small group of people to have such a discussions, perhaps the HR site lead or the construction site manager would be the appropriate liaisons.  That way, we don't have the unions approaching our employees.  We have no obligation to have such conversations, but it is a good idea not to be antagonistic with them.   Better to be polite, let them know that we are mobilizing the project, but that we bid this work as a merit shop project and will not sign a pre-hire agreement.  We should not give them any information about our hiring process or plans.

We should tell them that we will be glad to consider their people at the time we are hiring, but that we are not taking applications at this time.  We should inform them about how to apply for positions at the site, which will be at an off-site Human Resources office.  We also are going to use the state employment offices for clerical personnel, but not for other types because we have not had much success in receiving qualified candidates.

There is a need for HR to look at the off-site office before the lease is signed.

Other issues surround gating at the facility.  How will it be gated?  Who will control entry and exits?  What about the other ways into the site?  How do we prevent persons from using an alternative entrance and then getting into our site to talk with our people?  Parking area will be on the other side of the plant.  There are roads between the parking gate and the building site.  Because of all these issues, we should look at a plat for the site and then look at the gating situation.

Back to Mark's suggestions:

Be careful of calls coming into the project.  Make sure that the receptionist or office manager knows what to say to callers.  Those calls should be directed to that site HR lead.  Also, should inform those people how to answer questions about hiring plans.  E.g., ""Are you hiring electricians out there?""  Those should be referred to HR's off site office.  Also, those people should know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees.  They should refer such questions to HR and not answer them.  We will have a script for the receptionist for such inquiries.

Be sure to follow the 30-day rule.  Also, follow our hiring practices consistently.

Ultimately, there will be training for others at the site after more employees are on site, perhaps the last week of October, on union avoidance and other issues.

One more follow up item is to make sure that our subcontracts have union harmony provisions.  Galen (Millie?) is going to send those to David Lund.

David Lund, Michelle Cash, and Mark Stubley will discuss the issue of which local counsel to get lined up in the event that we need someone locally.

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

resources on the identification and elimination of market power in 
electricity markets and the need to encourage the development of distributed 
generation and more effective demand - side response mechanisms , partly in 
response to market power concerns. This is a huge issue in  getting wholesale 
electricity markets to work effectively, i.e; to create discernable  consumer 
welfare benefits.... and we ( Enron ) need to talk about this this issue and

660,"Kenny's comments are absolutely false or, at best,  grossly misleading.  We 
need to respond to him.

The NUMBER ONE problem we have in California that is delaying our proposed 
power plant developments is securing ERCs.  My discussions with Calpine 
indicate that ERCs are their biggest problem as well.  (And in case someone 
hasn't noticed, the two most active developers in CAlifornia are Enron and 
Calpine.)  Air quality laws are definitely slowing us down, and slowing 
others down, which keeps the new, cleaner plants from being developed.  As I 
have mentioned before, this is actually making air quality worse in that the 
older, dirtier plants are running more.  Further, if you do the math, we will 
probably never make up for the dirty air that is created by keeping the dirty 
plants in business because of grandfathering, while the clean plants don't 
get done because of ever more rigorous BACT standards and lack of ERCs.    

Having said that, I do not agree that we should send a message that we want 
to relax or suspend the standards.  (However, getting 2ppm plants on line, 
which will put out of business the 100+ppm plants - as Calpine indicated to 
me happened in Texas - makes the point that maybe a relaxation or suspension 
is the environmentally appropriate thing to do.)  All in all, though, I 
believe that sucha common sense approach will go nowhere in California 
because the little people in the regulatory positions as well as the public 
will make sure that we pay for such a message.  Having said that, I will 
repeat the key things that we should be promoting, in my opinion:  1.)  stop 
the EPA from tightening the BACT standards to ever increasing levels of 
insanity.  (GE will not guarantee the present, and new, EPA requirement of 
2ppm, which EPA ""determined"" with no new operating data.  They just did it 
because they could.)  2.)  Stop making up rules for RACT adjustments.  (Kelly 
Brodbeck is working very hard, for example, to develop a program in the Bay 
Area to retrofit boats with clean burning engines to create ERCs.  A high 
level staff guy at BAAQMD ""believes"" that we should be RACT adjusted, 
probably making the program uneconomic.  There isn't even unanimity for this 
position on his staff.  However, this position if it sticks is irresponsible 
in light of the fact that the boats can just keep on doing what they are 
doing.  We are creating ERCs, which the BAAQMD will take a portion of in 
their haircut, and in using the ERCs, we will eventually put out of business 
the dirtier plants.  So, our program gets RACT adjusted and the air gets 
dirtier...)  3.)  Allow for payment of mitigation fees in lieu of buying 
ERCs.  There is precedent for that, but this has to be run through the SIP 
and the EPA.  Again, the in-lieu fees can be used for gov sponsored ERC 
developments (e.g., electric lawn mowers, electric water heaters, etc.), 
which will clean the air.  I am aware that Sandy is working with the CA 
legislature on this.  Go Sandy!

us so that I can get a better understanding of what I should/should not being 
spending time on.

The Minnesota PUC ruled yesterday the US West must open/share it's lines with 
competitors offering digital subscriber line (DSL) high speed interent 
access.  Apparently the order is the first for a state, but I understand that 
the FCC passed a similiar rule in the last month or so.  The Commission also 
ruled that USWest could charge an additional $6.00 for this access to their 
lines (in addition to the current rate of $18 that the customer pays) and 
that the DSL provider had the right to pass that charge on to the customer.  
The COmmission took a ""soft"" position on the $6.00, saying that they would 
review the amount of the charge over the next six months before making a 
final ruling on that specific issue.  I believe that this ruling came about 
due to an initial complaint by  a provider from Colorado.

I did not follow this case at all other than occassionally reading something 
about it. The major reason I did not was that I saw it as a ""retail"" access 
issue and I see our video streaming and bandwidth businesses as ""wholesale"" 
access/opportunity issues.  Certainly we always want to see open access and 
we want to see competitive parity, but I didn't see that our involvment 
and/or tracking of this proceeding was of great value.  Am I correct?

673,"Q1: What are the main reasons for having a common currency Euro for the  EU?

        Transactions of money and trade will less expensive because currency
exchange cost will disappear.  Saves the costs of hedging exchange rate risks
(some monetary, others due to the drain on managerial attention) or the risks
of not heding fixed but adjustable rates.  Makes price differences more
transparent across borders, which may increase trade.  Economists do not fully
understand why, but beyond the measurable effects of the effects I just
mentioned, a common currency increases trade even more than these slightly
lower transaction costs can explain.
        The process of qualifying for unification also required lower 
inflation
and deficits, which many economists and politicians desired.
        The main arguments for monetary unifications were political, not
economic, having to do with integrating Western Europe.

Q2: Beside losing its monetary authority, what are the reasons that the UK 
does
not want to join the Euro? I believe the Government has a different opinion
than the public. What are these arguments?

As you note, the economic reason is fear of losing control over domestic
monetary policy.  As with the decision to join, the UK's decision not to join
was largely political, choosing NOT to unify as rapidly with Europe on 
monetary
and lots of other matters (social charter that may regulate working 
conditions,
etc.).

Q3: In my notes, I wrote ""You don't get rich by exporting -- you get rich in
the short run by importing."" What do you mean?

I said that unclearly.  I should have said, ""You do not raise your standard of
living by exporting; you raise it by importing.""  At the same time, exports 
are
the price of imports, so you raise your grandkids' standard of living by
exporting intsead of borrowing to pay for the imports.  (Unless the imports 
are
high-value investment goods...)

Q4: I also wrote in my notes: ""Trade deficits and exchange rates can't be used
to describe a country's prosperity.""  If trade deficits and exch. rates can't
be used to describe prosperity, what is the best measure? At first GDP comes 
to
mind, but in my day 2 notes, there are all sorts of reasons why GDP isn't a
good measure, the most poignant one being: ""2 countries have the same GDP, but
one country has twice as many people -- this country has lower per capita GDP,
and is poorer than the first country.""
        CRUX: is per capita GDP a good measure of prosperity?

Per capita is a pretty good measure of prosperity and living standards.  The
list we gave are all the components of ""the good life"" it leaves out.  On
average, rich nations have higher life expectancy, etc., so GDP per capita is
not too misleading, but it clearly can be (as we pointed out).  Thus, no 
single
measure suffices, and a combination of measures can be useful.

1.  Change the requirement to 90%     OR
2.  Apply the 95% penalty solely to underscheduling of load
3.  The rule applies to an entities' entire load.
4.  Smaller scheduling coordinators (i.e. smaller than the PX or IOUs) have
less diverse loads and are more subject to unforeseen swings -- so 95% is
very difficult to
achieve -- another disincentive to direct access and competition.

literature.  I evidently have not used the one I should have in section.
So here is a definitive explanation of quasi-rent.  You can also look in
Besanko on pages 153-154.  Note that this definition does not change how
we should solve the problems.  It is simply a definition.  I apologize for
any sudden panic attacks this causes.

Quasi-rent should be considered as equal to your sunk costs.  This is the
amount another business can hold you up for after your entry.  If I have
to sink 5 million dollars to enter, my quasi-rent will be 5 million
dollars, which I may be held up for after I enter.   Thus in solving
holdup problems, you can consider it two ways.  1.  The potential holdup
amount is equal to the quasirent which equals the sunk cost at that point.
or 2. How much does a firm have to receive to continue to produce AFTER
sinking their sunk costs.

I hope this definition has cleared the haze which I am at least partially
responsible.   Once again, the explanation of how to solve these problems
has always been correct.  The strict definition of quasirents was not.

recovery directly to throughput over the wires, ensuring that both energy

697,"The GSR reporting service reported today that a new complaint (California 
Electricity Oversight Board v. All Sellers of Energy and Ancillary 
Services/California Independepent System Operator/California Power Exchange 
Corporation, EL00-104-000 (08/29/00)) was filed yesterday that requests the 
Commission to direct the CAISO too maintain bid caps of $250/MWh for energy 
and ancillary services, and $100 for replacement reserves until the 
Commission has completed its investigation of California markets.  The 
complaint also requests consolidation with the existing investigation in 
Docket Nos. EL00-95-000 and EL00-98-000.

Although I have not seen the complaint as yet (we'll get a copy to you as 
soon as it is available), this strikes me as largely a frivolous complaint 
that adds nothing to what is already going on.  In addition to the existing 
investigation, the ISO has indicated that it will file (sometime in 
mid-September) for authority to impose a price cap on ancillary services 
beyond 11/15/00, when the existing authority terminates.   The Oversight 
Board's complaint thus strikes me as a politically motivated public relations 
filing that is designed to maintain pressure on the ISO and to shift blame 
away from California and onto FERC if things really go bad in the state.

Moreover, the Commission has held that the price cap is a ""purchaser's cap"" 
that simply establishes the price that the ISO, as a purchaser of ancillary 
services, is willing to pay.  Thus, the Commission has held that it is not 
establishing a maximum rate by approving the ISO's ability to impose a price 
cap.  By requesting the Commission to direct the ISO to maintain a price cap, 
rather than allow the ISO to do so on its own, however, the Oversight Board's 
complaint seems inconsistent with the Commission's theory on this matter.

I'll send you FERC's notice as soon as I get it.  I assume that I should 
prepare a plain vanilla intervention for EPMI/EES at the minimum.  Please 
advise if you would like me to include any comments, such as those indicated 
above.

DON'T BLAME DEREGULATION FOR SUMMER'S `BROWNOUTS' 
THE ECONOMIST\

?
This has been a miserable summer in California. Thanks to a surge in 
electricity consumption, Californians and other Americans have endured 
several power failures. 
Since brownouts were rare in the past, some wonder if recent steps to 
liberalize the power market are to blame. Politicians are meddling, 
arbitrarily imposing rate freezes and price caps. This week President Bill 
Clinton offered federal subsidies to poor people and small firms hit by 
higher power prices in California. 
?


A growing chorus is arguing that electricity deregulation has gone too far 
and too fast. The problem is just the opposite. The real culprits behind this 
summer's power failures are the muddle and hesitation surrounding the 
introduction of competition in much of America. 
In places such as Britain, Scandinavia and Australia, which began 
liberalizing long ago, the transition to competitive power has been orderly 
and free of mishap; consumers there enjoy reliable power, lower prices and 
better service. 
California's deregulation has failed to yield such gains largely because it 
neglected a variety of market realities. 
Companies will invest in generation only if the rules of the game are clear. 
In America, they seldom are. That is partly because of the country's federal 
structure, which has left the states to take the initiative in electricity 
deregulation. 
About half have opened up their markets, but each has its own peculiarities. 
This patchwork, plus changing environmental regulation, explains why so many 
utilities have avoided building new plants for years. 
State governments should base reforms on clear and consistent rules. The 
federal government also needs to bring order to interstate power trading. 
Regulators must break the monopoly of the aging and overloaded distribution 
system. 
Merely generating more power at big central plants far from markets means 
little unless it can reach consumers - and bottlenecks on the grid mean that 
not enough of it does. Expanding distribution capacity is often impossible in 
crowded urban areas, and elsewhere people dislike new power lines. 
Dramatic advances in technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, which 
generate power efficiently and cleanly on a smaller scale, may make up the 
shortfall. But regulators still tend to imagine that power will flow in one 
direction only: from big plants to small consumers. 
To ease the bottlenecks, they should follow the recent move by New York state 
to facilitate access to the grid for small micropower plants. 
The other area of reform is the hardest but also the most crucial: the 
consumer market. 
In the long run, liberalization and competition will deliver lower 
electricity prices for companies and households alike. However, in many 
places, retail prices remain fixed by government fiat. 
There is a case for protecting domestic households from price volatility 
until a genuinely competitive retail market emerges. However, the zeal with 
which politicians have introduced arbitrary price ""rollbacks"" suggests that 
they may turn any exception into the rule. 
This would be a mistake, for unless consumers see fluctuations in prices 
(especially at peak times), they have no incentive to conserve power or shift 
their use off-peak. 
The right way forward is to allow retail prices to fluctuate with market 
conditions. This will encourage consumers to use power more judiciously and 
speed the arrival of such innovations as fixed-price ""energy service"" 
contracts, which promise outcomes such as certain levels of heating, rather 
than merely delivery of a set amount of electricity. 
Price transparency will also allow micropower plants to buy and sell power on 
the grid as demand dictates, so improving the grid's reliability. 
In fits and starts, America is heading toward the promise of competitive 
energy markets. Consumers in Pennsylvania, for example, now pay $3 billion a 
year less for their electricity than they did before 1999. 
The populism and shortsightedness of its regulators and politicians must not 
stop California from getting there, too.

Please find below a State Department Fact Sheet on Chemical and Biological

for you to have this information. Please note the intended audience is 
Americans living overseas.

Sebastian

==============================


U.S. Department of State
Washington, D.C.

FACT SHEET
CHEMICAL - BIOLOGICAL AGENTS

The recent terrorist threats and confirmed cases of exposure to anthrax have
caused an increase in anxiety over the possibility of chemical and
biological attacks (CBA). Currently, the method of delivery of anthrax has
been by letter or package. While the risk of such attacks is limited, it
cannot be excluded. As always, the Department will promptly share with
American citizens overseas any credible information about threats to their
safety. Americans should stay informed and be prepared for any eventuality.


In 1999, the Department of Defense announced its intention to commence the
Family and Force Protection Initiative (FFPI) in order to provide enhanced
protection to the dependents of U.S. military service members and to
civilian Department of Defense (DOD) employees and their families. This
program was first implemented for U.S. Forces Korea.

The Department of State has had a chemical and biological countermeasure
program since 1998, when it began to deploy chemical antidotes and
antibiotics to selected posts abroad. While we have no information to
indicate there is an imminent threat from use of anthrax or other biological
agents as a weapon against our overseas missions at this time, the
Department is expanding its countermeasure program. As a precaution, the
Department requested our missions overseas to stock a three-day supply of
the antibiotic ciprofloxacin for all individuals who work in or frequent the
missions.

This small supply of ciprofloxacin is being pre-positioned to ensure rapid
access to this protective antibiotic for our employees in case of an Anthrax
exposure in an overseas USG facility and would allow the mission sufficient
time to provide access to care for all individuals exposed while securing
additional supplies of antibiotics. Once an exposure is suspected, all
individuals who had been exposed in our workplace would be provided
antibiotics pending a full investigation of the exposure. This would include
any private American citizen present in the facility at the time of
exposure.

Again, if the Department becomes aware of any specific and credible threat
to the safety and security of American citizens abroad, that information
will be provided to them promptly.

Exposures to CBA that occur outside USG facilities would require the
involvement of local public health authorities who would provide information
and if necessary, protective antibiotics to the general public.
Ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics effective against Anthrax, including
doxycycline and amoxicillin are available with a prescription in most
pharmacies throughout the world.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the lead government
agency on infectious diseases, including chemical/biological agents (CBA).
For detailed information on CBA, including Anthrax, inquirers are referred
to the CDC Internet home page at http://www.cdc.gov. The CDC's international
travelers hotline telephone number is 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747);
fax: 1-888-CDC-FAXX (1-888-232-3299).

As always, American citizens should review their own personal security
situations and take those precautions they deem appropriate to ensure their
well-being.

Some general information on chemical-biological agents (CBA) follows:

A. Biological agents can be dispersed by an aerosol spray that must be
inhaled. However, these agents can also be used to contaminate food, water
and other products. Attention to basic food hygiene when traveling abroad is
very important.

A. Some chemical agents may be volatile--evaporating rapidly to form
clouds of agent. Others may be persistent. These agents may act directly on
the skin, lungs, eyes, respiratory tract or be absorbed through your skin
and lungs causing injury. Choking and nerve agents damage the soft tissue
in these organs.

A. When properly used, appropriate masks are effective protection to
prevent the inhalation of either biological or chemical agents; however this
assumes an adequate warning. Gas masks alone do not protect against agents
that act through skin absorption. Those who wish to acquire protective
equipment for personal use should contact commercial vendors.

A. There is an incubation period after exposure to biological agents.
It is essential that you seek appropriate care for illnesses acquired while
traveling abroad to assure prompt diagnosis and treatment.

A. One of the biological warfare agents is the spore-forming bacterium
that causes Anthrax, an acute infectious disease. It should be noted,
however, that effective dispersal of the Anthrax bacteria is difficult.

* Anthrax is treatable if that treatment is initiated promptly after
exposure. The post-exposure treatment consists of certain antibiotics
administered in combination with the vaccine.

* An anthrax vaccine that confers protective immunity does exist, but
is not readily available to private parties. Efficacy and safety of use of
this vaccine for persons under 18 or over 65 and pregnant women have not
been determined.
*
* The anthrax vaccine is produced exclusively by Bioport under
contract to the Department of Defense. Virtually all vaccine produced in
the United States is under Defense Department contract primarily for
military use and a small number of other official government uses.

* For additional information, please consult your health care provider
or local health authority.

Green energy sources seen as ripe for growth

By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published Sept. 10, 2001) 

Wind and hot water, sunshine and rotting garbage. 

They all could keep California's lights on -- for a price. 

Around the state, more people are beginning to suggest that price is worth paying to help smooth out the ride on the state's power roller coaster. 

This week, Sacramento's municipal utility will begin hearings on an ambitious 10-year plan that would nearly triple its reliance on non-hydroelectric sources of renewable electric power, such as wind farms and solar panels. 

In the Legislature, a hotly debated bill would require every power seller in the state to provide increasing amounts of ""green"" power, rising to 20 percent of their portfolios by 2010. That would roughly double current supplies. 

""This may be the silver lining of the energy crisis if we can get this passed,"" said state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, author of SB 532. 

More than a dozen states and many nations already have ""portfolio standards"" that require each utility or other power venders to provide a set share of electricity from renewable sources. The amounts can be as low as 2 percent or 3 percent, or as high as 30, partly depending on what gets called ""renewable."" 

Environmental and some consumer groups have embraced the idea, saying it would bring a constellation of advantages. 

The air would be cleaner, they say. Finite resources such as coal, natural gas and other fossil fuels would be used more sparingly. And in California, the state would be a little less vulnerable next time prices sail through the stratosphere for natural gas, the chosen fuel for virtually all new power plants. 

But free-market advocates and some utilities are dubious. 

They worry that a state-mandated portfolio standard would drive up prices. It could reward inefficiencies in energy sources that are otherwise too expensive to stand on their own. And in the push to diversify from natural gas, critics of such standards don't want to see the state turn its back on potentially lower cost power sources, including coal, nuclear power and new large dams. 

""Ignoring hydroelectric power is shortsighted, and I think not considering nuclear options within the state, at least giving it some public hearing, is shortsighted,"" said Karal Cottrell, a Sacramento Municipal Utility District director. 

It is a debate that will help shape California's power future, and it comes as the state has begun loading up on natural gas plants. 

Just over half of in-state electricity production now is fueled by natural gas, but that could rise to 65 percent by 2010 if all currently proposed gas-fired plants are built, said Mark Bernstein, an energy analyst at RAND. 

Long viewed as relatively cheap and comparatively clean, natural gas still could pose risks if it dominates the state's power picture. 

""We have a very hard time predicting the price of anything, particularly energy these days,"" said Bernstein. ""What happens if the pressures on price are so great that they go way up?"" 

That fear has been sobering for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, whose officials worry the utility might be becoming too dependent on two mainstays: hydro power, with its risks of short supplies in dry years, and natural gas. 

Already considered a leader in renewable power, SMUD gets about 7 percent of its electricity from non-hydro renewables. In a series of workshops beginning Tuesday , it will seek public feedback on a proposed 10-year plan that would raise that amount to 10 percent by 2006 and 20 percent by 2011. 

""If we commit to this, this will be the largest renewable commitment, I believe, in the state right now,"" General Manager Jan Schori told directors. 

Renewable power would cost more, but the benefits in diversification and price stability should be worth it, said SMUD planning chief Jim Tracy. His proposal calls for spending no more than an extra penny per kilowatt-hour for renewables. 

At first, SMUD plans to expand its Solano County wind farm, continue subsidizing solar panels and consider working with the county to expand the Kiefer landfill plant, which runs on methane seeping out of rotting garbage. That should get the utility close to 10 percent. 

By 2003, staffers would return to the board with a study on how to reach the far more challenging second phase: boosting green power another 10 percent at a livable price. 

The likeliest cost-effective sources so far look like wind and geothermal power, said Tracy. 

That's also the consensus among those who hope the state will pass its own portfolio standard before the Legislature adjourns Friday. 

Wind turbines -- once disparaged as generating more tax breaks than electricity -- have become bigger, more powerful and far more dependable in the past decade. Aided by a federal tax credit, they now can supply power at between 3 cents and 6 cents a kilowatt-hour, depending on location, according to the American Wind Energy Association. At its lower end, that makes wind nearly competitive with a new natural gas plant. 

Geothermal power, tapped by drilling into underground beds of hot steam or water, runs between 4.5 cents and 7 cents a kilowatt-hour, and could go lower if it, too, qualifies for the next round of federal credits, plant developers say. 

Both sources of power are plentiful in California. 

The state is the 13th best source of wind in the nation, with untapped wind resources along mountain ridges running almost the length of the state. 

Geothermal power already makes up 5 percent of the state's supply and could rise by thousands of megawatts, with rich beds in the Imperial Valley and elsewhere still not fully tapped. 

By comparison, solar power costs more than 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, although it can have special appeal to homeowners living far from power lines or those who want to produce their own electricity. 

Both wind and geothermal could be ""a shoo-in"" economically if natural gas prices float higher, said Matt Freedman of the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group that usually advocates for lower power costs. 

Today, it's also one of the biggest lobbyists for a renewable portfolio standard. 

""We think the standard is going to save consumers money, or in the worst case, it's like an insurance policy,"" said Freedman. ""I think consumers are willing for that to be part of the mix these days."" 

But with only a week left to go, Freedman said, ""the enemy of (Sher's) bill is time."" 

That's actually just one of the enemies. 

Others include Sempra Energy, parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., and the California Manufacturers Association, which fear it would boost electric rates. 

""When a major thrust of the state is to reduce prices as much as possible, is this really a good time for this?"" asked Sempra spokesman Ed Van Herik. 

Both Sempra and the Assembly's Republican caucus point out that more than $100 million a year already is collected from consumers' electric bills and funneled into a fund that supports renewable energy. 

The portfolio standard could have Californians paying again -- up to the 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour cap in the bill -- for power that they've already helped subsidize, they say. 

""Renewable energies are becoming more efficient on their own,"" said Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth, R-Temecula. ""To artificially prop them up will stifle that innovation."" 

California already gets about 9 percent of its total energy supply, including imports, from non-hydro renewables, and an additional 3 percent from small hydro. The state Energy Commission predicts that current programs could boost that to 17 percent by 2006. 

So to Sher, author of the renewables bill, raising that amount to 20 percent by 2010 is actually a modest goal.

728,"In the same Decision that the CPUC is considering voting out on suspending 
Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to 
suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers.

The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to 
make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already 
paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC).
The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC 
credit.
The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of 
payment or would be permanent.
The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E.

The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now 
have a bill credit receivable.  In addition, because EES re-sourced its 
customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the 
customer account.  The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill 
credit is to utilize the Utilities' services.  Even if EES physically serves 
the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill 
credit.  

The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is 
unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case.

We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) 
trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us 
payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow 
us to be paid if our account became ""inactive"".

One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE 
management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to 
route the economic value to our DA customers.  

If anyone has any questions, please call me to discuss.

Dear Market Participants:

The California Power Exchange has just completed a comprehensive credit
redesign.  Our new credit policies now incorporate new credit methodologies
similar to those used at major commodity exchanges. Specifically, CalPX now
recognizes more aspects of the actual market volatility and individual 
portfolio
risk in order to provide quantifiable management information on the collateral
accounts of participants while maintaining the integrity of our markets.  We
have also combined financial requirements for our CORE (Day-Ahead, Day-Of and
Real Time) and CTS (Forwards) markets.  The incorporation of a $20 million
default bond in our CORE market and a liquidity line up to $50 million in our
CTS market provide insurance protection in the event of a default and allow
timely management of cash flow in the markets.

Enclosed for your review are all the necessary documents pertaining to our
credit redesign, including a brief instruction sheet to assist you with the
completion of these documents.  We thank you in advance for your timely 
handling
of these materials, and we respectfully request that you complete the enclosed
by August 31, 2000.

730,"The attached comments in FERC's rulemaking proceeding on reporting 
requirements for the California market are being filed today.   The comments 
express our opinions that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are 
not appropriate to address a temporary problem and that the markets are 
working as they should and responding with new pipeline proposals to address 
lack of capacity, (2) the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act to 
require information are for investigatory purposes only, not for formalized, 
routine reporting requirements, (3) the notice of order does not indicate how 
the Comission would protect the proprietary and competitively sensitive 
information it would collect, and (4) the requirements impose a significant 
and undue burden on sellers of natural gas who would have to radically alter 
the way they manage their business in order to provide the information in the

scheduled a meeting? of the group in Sacramento on Friday, December 15th, at 
10:00 at the Chamber of Commerce's office. 

In the interim, we should all be working toward building the strawpaper 
outlined in yesterday's agenda.? I plan to complete an outline of what we did 
manage to agree to (or identify as proposals) yesterday by the end of 
Friday.? Other responsibilities include: 

preparation by SCE, AES, Enron and the PX of proposals for a ""benchmark"" 
against which, if necessary, individual purchases by the utility could be 
measured for the next 1-2 years;? proposals for longer term benchmarks for 
measuring the reasonableness of the utility portfolio would be helpful, but 
we need to focus on the short-run first.? Also, throw out ideas on tolerance 
bands, including a way to expand/contract the band with changes in 
volatility, and risk/reward mechanisms for utility shareholders.
proposals by SCE, AES and the PX (and any others with ideas) regarding how we 
can address in an overall solution the risk perceived by the utility of 
customer attrition from the utility portfolio (e.g., term commitments, two 
portfolios or a bifurcated single portfolio, etc.);
a proposal from SCE and CLECA regarding how to commoditize the utility 
generating assets (assuming retention of the entitlement to the generation) 
and allocate those assets to small/large customers as the foundational supply 
component of two portfolios (overlaying longer term contracts in the small 
customer portfolio and potentially shorter and medium term contracts in the 
large customer portfolio).
proposals for mechanisms to provide customers with some ability to understand 
the overall cost of utility procurement for comparison with ESP fixed price 
contracts (e.g.,? publication of ""actual"" to date on a monthly basis, 
forecast of fixed price, fixed price product offering).

Obviously, any other ideas you have will be welcomed. 

We failed to make much progress on the design for any stabilized rate or TRA 
undercollections. Consider more carefully (1) whether a ""residual"" (SCE) or 
stand-alone (PG&E) calculation for procurement costs would best serve your 
interests and (2) what level of increase could be tolerated effective early 
2001.? Also consider structural proposals for addressing the TRA 
undercollections prior to the end of the rate freeze. 

Our goal should be to close on a structure, with as many details as possible, 
by Friday, December 15.? Please call me for any reason that will help us move 
this along.

filed comments argueing for a waiver of QF regulations in order to incent
more power into the California marketplace.  IEP discussed this concept with
FERC Commissioners today and the Commission issued late today an Order
Granting Emergency Waiver of QF Regulations for the remainder of this year.
This order is attached as part of an additional order by FERC granting the
CAISO request for implementation of a $250 ""soft cap"" plus penalities for
failue to respond to CAISO dispatch orders during an emergency.

For QFs positioned to take advantage of the FERC Order, IEP suggests (1)
procure legal advice because in essense you have an existing contract with
the utility, (2) contact your utility/contract holder, and as appropriate
move to implement the FERC Order.  Your existing bilateral contract with the
utility provides for a SRAC based payment mechanism which appears to apply
under the FERC Order.   Note, however, that the waiver at this time only
applies through the end of this year.  You may have other options as well.

Here is the latest draft of the ACR comments.  I have incorporated Rick
Counihan's comments and tried to fill in the discussion along the lines of
our most recent conference call.  As you can see we still need to fill in
some quotes and citations, and I will add more discussion around the quotes
we have included in the ""outside comment"" portion of the draft to give them
more context.

In that regard, I would appreciate any other suggestions or research anyone
had in terms of additional quotes or writings commenting on the California
restructuring that we can use.  Please forward to me as soon as possible.
As this must be filed on Friday and we will be in an all day ARM meeting
that day, I need to finalize the comments Thursday morning.  Please forward
your comments on this draft no later than the close of business
tomorrow-Wednesday.  Thanks very much for your cooperation.

Let me add (without any false humility, because this was drafted in large
part by Jeanne and by Rick) that I think the comments are looking good, and
can serve as the concise manifesto of our position in the case that we hoped
it would be.  Obviously, we want to make it as strong and persuasive as
possible, so we appreciate any time you can put into offering suggestions
for improvement.

Thanks.  Mike Day

New Book Uncovers The Secret to Turning Wild and Creative Ideas Into 
Multi-Million Dollar Innovation

(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CHICAGO, April 24 /PRNewswire/ -- You're at your local grocery store or 
shopping mall when you spot it -- that one product that makes you say out 
loud, ""Who came up with that idea and why didn't I think of it first?"" As it 
happens, though, you may have thought of it. So why aren't you now reaping 
the benefits from its sales? Companies such as Bacardi, Coldwell Banker, 
Enron and Starbucks can tell you why. You were hit with a humorous bazooka. 
For many years companies have been touting their innovation, techniques and 
experiences, but as they can tell you, it takes dedication and perseverance 
to arrive at the point where innovation is a strategic part of any business. 
Innovation begins with a creative idea; however, without an environment that 
allows that idea to grow, nothing comes of it except frustrated comments 
like, ""Why didn't I think of it first?""
In his new book, Ban the Humorous Bazooka: (And Avoid Roadblocks and Speed 
Bumps along the Innovation Highway), innovation guru Mark Henry Sebell shares 
his experiences and case studies to show how and why ideas are quickly 
silenced. As the founder and president of Creative Realities, Inc., a Boston- 
based consulting firm specializing in innovation processes that dramatically 
increase the odds for successful outcomes, Sebell spells out what it takes to 
achieve real breakthroughs in innovation, in spite of the speed bumps 
(individual behaviors) and roadblocks (group behaviors and cultural norms) 
that impede progress. 
Sebell's impressive Who's Who client list has taken part in the book, 
allowing him to share stories from the front lines of innovation, humanizing 
the concepts and providing tangible and practical tools to make innovation 
work beyond any and all expectations. ""... I now keep a toy bazooka 
prominently displayed in my office as a constant 'innovation reminder' that 
every idea, no matter how unconventional or implausible, has potential value 
and should always be encouraged,"" says Alex Perriello, president and CEO, 
Coldwell Banker Real Estate Corporation. 
Sebell defines a humorous bazooka as a funny, witty comment that, 
intentionally or unintentionally, shoots down another person's idea. In other 
words -- an innovation killer. In ""Ban the Humorous Bazooka,"" readers examine 
the nine myths of innovation, bringing a greater awareness to the exciting 
and messy work that must be done in order to discover, nurture, launch and 
implement a great idea. Sebell also utilizes past and current client examples 
to provide the reader with the five phases of innovation essential to any 
creative and innovative pursuit. Starting with objective setting and then 
following the phases through discovery, invention, the greenhouse and 
implementation and launch, Sebell paints a thorough and motivating sequence 
of events. 
Sebell counts among his clients such firms as Compaq Computer, Walt Disney 
World Soup, Enron, PepsiCo, Citigroup, Starbucks and Dewar's Scotch.

For an extra approximately $900/person, you can add a 3 day land package

see the wildlife.

Carnival Cruises goes too but this cruise sounded more suited to mom and dad.
According to the rep, more elegant, good food, etc.

I have a courtesy reservation for the July cruise (figuring it might be
warmer, though she said that June and July are warmest) I got the ocean view
room.

I don't know 1-800 CRUISES   from Adam.  I will try and call my travel agent
tomorrow just to see what she says about Royal Caribbean.

If we do the July cruise and land package, it is $4998 (air fare, cruise,
port costs) for mom and dad which comes to $1300 for each one of us.

I leave Saturday for a week so I'd appreciate some feedback before I go if
possible (not necessarily a commitment, just feedback).  I think they have
this hold for a few days though I don't necessarily think we have to decide
immediately.  If we want to do this, there is a $300/person deposit (didn't
ask if it is refundable or not), with the balance due 75 days before

767,"HEADLINE: Davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger

BYLINE: By Daniel Borenstein

BODY:

??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide
convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and
strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov. Gray Davis 
fails
to clean up the power mess.

??""All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to
have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the
governor will have on the ticket up and down,"" said state Sen. Don Perata,
D-Alameda. ""If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that
could be problematic.""

??Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the
state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters 
understand
Davis didn't create the problem.

??""It won't be solved in six months,"" South said. ""This is an immediate 
problem
that is not susceptible to an immediate solution. This is a several-year 
process
to get this situation back under control.""

??As for the governor's critics, ""I think they should be asked to produce 
their
own plan. It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read 
about
in the newspapers have no plan.""

??The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the
frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political
damage.

??Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a
Davis fete. Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried
California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the 
state's
congressional delegation.

??Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally
and politically popular across the state. This would have been the convention
for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised 
to
make the hallmark of his first term.

??But electricity now overshadows everything else. To be sure, the governor
will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the
convention delegates. And he is not shying away from the spotlight.

??Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California
Adventure Theme Park. That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento
who won't be attending to quip, ""We're in fantasy land here, thank you. We 
don't
need to go to Disneyland for that.""

??Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled 
the
events of the past week. ""In many ways, he appears to have gone politically 
tone
deaf,"" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate
University. ""His instincts are not serving him well.""

??While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them 
that
a $10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis,
Davis was at a $10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money
for his re-election campaign.

??When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week
approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for 
months,
Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and
that he thought it was premature.

??Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue. ""I'm
glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some
of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight
weeks,"" said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch. ""There's a high level of
frustration. There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is.""

??South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the
governor's control. ""No one can predict with any certainty where this is going
to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under
control. We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to
do.""

??As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and 
Democrats
remain in a strong position. After all, he said, the deregulation plan was
pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are
blocking efforts to cap prices.

??Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted
Davis could weather the electricity crisis. ""People who are following it know
it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't
have any plausible alternatives,"" he said.

??""My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy
solution and they're not expecting one. They may be impatient but they won't
necessarily take it out on (Davis).""

??It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare,
pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California.

??""The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing
cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the
personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are,"" he said.
""That's the really crucial period for Gray Davis' political future, after this
summer.""

UCLA FORECASTERS SEE NATIONAL RECESSION AS INEVITABLE IN 2001; CALIFORNIA 
WILL NOT BE IMMUNE, WITH BAY AREA VERY SUSCEPTIBLE





? 
LOS ANGELES --Economists with the UCLA Anderson Business Forecast see even 
more clear indicators of a recession for the nation in 2001 and project a 90 
percent chance that the nation's longest economic expansion will come to an 
end no later than the first quarter of 2002. 
""The year 2001 is a transition year that will take the U.S. economy from the 
Internet Rush of 1996-2000 to a lower level of sustainable economic growth in 
2002,"" said Edward Leamer, UCLA Anderson Business Forecast director and 
Anderson School professor. However, getting from here to there will involve 
some painful adjustments, he warns, and ""monetary medicine"" from the Fed 
won't stop the pain this time.
According to the econometric model used by UCLA's forecasters, the 
probability of a 2001 recession has increased nearly 30 percent since 
December 2000. Just three months ago, Dr. Leamer's forewarning of a recession 
was the most pessimistic -- and, as it turns out, the most accurate forecast 
made that quarter. 
""The expansion of 1999-2000 was driven by 'New Economy' investment 
opportunities. Firms rushed pell-mell to be the first kid on the block to 
have a cool website. Fear was a big motivator. Internet firms feared losing 
first-mover advantage. Bricks-and-mortar firms feared they would lose out to 
pure Internet business models. Almost every enterprise in the U.S. invested 
heavily in IT equipment and software, and hired the associated personnel,"" 
said Dr. Leamer. ""Things are different now."" 
The national recession and slowdown in investment in information technology 
and software has different implications for the principal regions of 
California. A recession is quite likely for the Bay Area, while Southern 
California will experience many economic stresses though skirting an outright 
recession. 
Dr. Tom Lieser, author of the California Forecast, expects to see a 
""high-tech"" recession in California that will have a disproportionate impact 
on the San Francisco Bay Area. ""We will most likely see not only a slowing of 
demand for electronics, communications equipment and related products, but 
also a weeding out of the less well-capitalized firms in these industries,"" 
said Dr. Lieser. 
The UCLA economist also expects a weak expansion in employment through 2002, 
with a corresponding rise in unemployment rates. A substantial slowdown in 
the California service sector -- a mainstay of the state's economic growth -- 
is also quite likely. 
""The strong increase in residential building permits seen during the 
November-January period will likely be short-lived,"" said Dr. Lieser. ""We 
expect to see declining home prices in the Bay Area this year. Southern 
California will also experience slower home sales and a lower rate of price 
increases."" 
Higher energy prices, the economists argue, may pose a greater problem for 
other states than for California, because of the state's lower per capita 
consumption. On a per capita basis, California ranked 49th out of 50 in 
electricity consumption and 26th in natural gas consumption, both in 1999. 
Even with the state's notorious dependence on the automobile, it still ranks 
only 15th out of the 47 reporting states in per capita gasoline consumption. 
And while the recent brownouts and blackouts may not perceptibly affect 
California incomes and employment in the short term, a prolonged electricity 
crisis could discourage business expansion significantly in the longer run.
The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast is the most widely followed and 
often-cited forecast for the state of California, and was unique in 
predicting both the seriousness of the early-1990s downturn in California and 
Southern California, and the strength of the state economy's rebound since 
1993. 
The Forecast was presented at an all-day conference at Korn Convocation Hall 
at The Anderson School at UCLA. In addition to providing the outlook for the 
state and national economy, the conference examined the economic impact of 
California's energy crisis through a series of panels led by some of the 
nation's most prominent authorities. Speakers included Loretta Lynch, 
president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Mark Bernstein, 
senior policy analyst at RAND Corporation, Barry Sedlik, manager, economic 
and business development, Southern California Edison, and Joseph M. Otting, 
executive vice president, Union Bank of California.

Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: ""the palace coup."" 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
""I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort,"" said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt ""betrayed"" by the actions of Winter. 
""The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis,"" Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
""It was an emergency,"" Fishman said. 
""We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
""They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much,"" said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
""All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
""If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to ""fix"" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
""In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
""The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. ""It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business."" 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
""We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. ""In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund."" 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
""Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
""He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing."" 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
""They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
""They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do."" 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
""We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out,"" Dunn said. ""Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

		Positive Living Tip of the Day
		Monday January 29, 2001
		
		Your Environment  
		
		Do you live or work in an environment that creates undue stress in your life?
		
		If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile 
environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can 
directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude.
		
		For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates 
those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects 
everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family 
members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is 
under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, 
negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes 
and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a 
reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative 
environments and begin building a positive life.

 Longhorns Enter Fall Football Workouts
With Lofty Ranking, but Several Problem Areas

Coach Mack Brown, speaking at the annual Big 12 football coaches and media
meeting in Dallas Friday, cited ""three primary areas of concern heading into
this season.""
He also scoffed at pre-season polls, which have UT high in the top 10,
saying, ""The only polls that matter are the ones at the end of the season.""
Offensively, he said, ""We do not have a tailback who stepped out (during the
spring) and showed he is ready to start.""
On defense, Brown said, ""Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers were great players at
defensive tackle last year. Casey was a first-round draft choice and Shaun
would have been if he had been healthy. Replacing them  is a real concern.""
On special teams, he cited the departure of Kris Stockton, who handled all
the kicking duties last season, and said developing a good kicking game will
be a key to having a succesfful season.
The freshmen report next Monday (August 6) and the varsity on August 9 (a
full practice schedule is on page 3).
My view is that the first two problem areas he mentioned are minor ones
compared to the place-kicking woes.
In the spring, the tailbacks looked solid, if not spectacular, and, with
super recruit Cedric Benson coming in to bolster that spot, it shouldn't be a
lingering problem.
At defensive tackle, sophomore Marcus Tubbs started three games last season
when Rogers' sore ankle limited his availability, and he played extensively
in all 12 games.
Tubbs had 5.5 sacks and 10 other tackles for losses and showed great promise
for the future.
He and most of the other defensive tackles are smaller and quicker than
Hampton and Rogers, which should help the front four show a lot of
improvement in pass rushing.
The tackles this year won't be as good against the run as Hampton and Rogers,
who were run-stoppers deluxe, but they will be pretty good at it, and, lets
face it, the best teams on the UT regular-season schedule are geared to
passing.
So two of the three problem areas Brown cited probably can be handled without
much difficulty.
But let's hope some of the walk-on kickers the UT staff rounded up after the
spring problems surfaced can kick field goals.
If they can't, and if this team is as good as it has a chance to be, Brown
could find himself in the same boat as Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, who
lost a couple of national championships in the 1990s because he didn't have
guys who could make a chip-shot field goal when the game was on the line.
I haven't seen any of the walk-on kickers in action, so I'll report on them
in depth in my next newsletter. They are supposed to be pretty good, and they
will need to be.
Brown said the Longhorns will have more experience this year and that will
help the team.
""We've had a lot of participation in the voluntary workouts this summer,
probably the most we've had,"" he said. ""There is more excitement and maturity
on the team and that's always a positive.""
When asked if he thinks there is a lot of pressure on him this year, he said
he wants a job where there is pressure because that means people want to win,
but he said some folks are chronic gripers.
""My wife told me when we first got married 10 years ago that if you look at
the gripers that are negative people, they probably griped about the meal
they had for lunch, they didn't like the last movie they saw, and they're mad
at their wife before they get home. So they're just mad at me.""
""I don't worry about those folks. I figure when you're selling 55,000 season
tickets and 66 luxury suites and you've sold out 13 straight at home,

My Big 12 Picks

I think this is the year the Big 12's Southern Division really becomes a
dominant force.
So, instead of picking the Southern and Northern Divisions, I'm going to pick
the way I think the Big 12 shapes up, from top to bottom, as a single entity.
Here goes:
1. Texas                7. Texas A&M
2. Oklahoma         8. Iowa State
3. Nebraska         9. Missouri
4. Kansas State     10. Oklahoma State
5. Colorado         11. Kansas
6. Texas Tech           12. Baylor
Obviously, the way I picked them means I think the winner of the
Texas-Oklahoma showdown in Dallas on Oct. 6 will win the whole thing.

Big 12 Coaches Give OU Edge

The Big 12 coaches picked Oklahoma to edge Texas in the South and Nebraska to
nose out Kansas State in the North.
Since they picked Texas last year and the Sooners won the national title,
let's hope what goes around comes around.
The vote was really close in the South, with the Sooners nipping the Horns,
6-5, with Texas coach Mack Brown abstaining.
Brown says he isn't going to get caught up in pre-season hype this year
because it doesn't make sense to try to predict how a team will do when it
hasn't even started practicing.
The media picked a pre-season All-Big 12 Team and it included four Longhorns
on the first team. They are senior OT Mike Williams, sophomore WR Roy
Williams, junior DE Cory Redding and senior CB Quentin Jammer.
Nebraska QB Eric Crouch was chosen the top pre-season offensive player and
Oklahoma LB Rocky Calmus won the defensive honors.

McClintock Undergoes Surgery

DE O. J. McClintock was released from the hospital Saturday after undergoing
emergency surgery Friday to repair what UT trainer Tom McVan said was
""significant damage to muscles and tendons in his right arm.""
McClintock, a 6-2, 250-pound junior, said Sunday he suffered some pretty deep
cuts when a relative stumbled and he rammed his hand and arm through a window
trying to grab the relative and keep him from falling.
""I've got to do some rehabilitation for my hand,"" he said Sunday. ""The
doctors told me I could start working out again in three or four weeks and,
if I miss any games, it shouldn't be more than the first one or two.""
The Longhorns were already thin at defensive end, and they could be
critically short if McClintock is out for a significant period of time.
""It's very unfortunate that O. J. was injured,"" said head coach Mack Brown.
""He did a tremendous job making the transition to defensive end (from
linebacker) in the spring and is a guy we have high hopes for this season.""
If McClintock's injury is serious enough to cause him to miss part of the
season, it will leave Texas with only senior Jermain Anderson and incoming
freshman Lance McFarland to back up starters Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding.
Another DE, Adam McConathy, was granted a release to transfer earlier. He
said he wanted to go to a school where he has a better chance to log some
playing time.
If the injury does cost McClintock significant playing time, the coaches will
make some moves to provide more depth. Incoming freshman Eric Hall, who had
been ticketed forfullback, would be a good candidate for a switch to
defensive end.

Mack Brown Notes, Quotes. .

Coach Mack Brown, speaking at the Big 12 coaches' meeting in Dallas Friday,
said the Longhorns ""can be really, really good but we've got to do a better
job day to day and week to week. We had three games we let get away last
year. Our goal is always to win every game we play.""
He also  said the coaches and players ""are proud that our team is being
looked at"" as one of the best in the country in the pre-season, but then he
said ""pre-season rankings mean absolutely nothing. We have to go out and take
care of business.""
He also downplayed expectations for heralded running back recruit Cedric
Benson, saying, ""We're not sure if freshmen will be involved in major roles
as early as they have.""
""Hopefully,"" he said, ""we can let a freshman grow into it instead of just
throwing him out there.""
But he also said the coaches plan to play the best players at each position.
If Benson lives up to all the hype and if none of the other tailbacks emerge
quickly, I think he'll play and play a lot early in the season.

Dollars and More Dollars

Texas and Nebraska far outdistance the other teams in the Big 12 when it
comes to raising and spending money.

every year and here are the most recent ones for all 12 conference members:

850,"I never heard back from you so I thought it best to drop a note. 

My interest in having a discussion with you are two fold:

1) I am currently making the resizing and structuring decisions for the 
Argentine business. There exist a strong bias towards consolidation of 
resources and headcount reduction. This is a decision of necessity and 
immediacy which does not afford everyone the opportunity to fully understand 
the markets that are being affected. This strategy clearly makes sense but I 
would like to make sure we avoid destroying value as this massive wave hits 
the beach.  

I need to better understand the balance between the aggregation of 
intellectual capital in Sao Paulo and the ability to maintain a credible 
commercial presence in an emerging market such as Argentina. If the reality 
is to shut down Argentina for the sake of emphasizing focus on Brazil fine. 
Then we should try to package and sell what we have already built to maximize 
value. We probably have gone too far to achieve this at this point. 

But I believe what we are trying to achieve is a liquid Argentina focus from 
Brazil. The risk here is we take this structure too far the other direction 
(IE ""The Wave""). Resizing to match commercial opportunity makes good sense 
but when we take it too far we risk giving the market the perception we are 
not serious which will immediately diminish our credibility and our ability 
to participate, transact and advance as a participant in the Argentine 
market. This corresponding destroys value in what we have achieved to date 
and what we are trying to achieve currently.

I just need to get this model clear in my mind as I finalize the Argentina 
structure and I have not had a chance to hear your thoughts directly. 

2) Joe has also asked me to become part of the Sao Paulo effort once I finish 
getting Argentina straightened out. To give him an answer I would be 
interested in your confidential opinion on the best utilization of my skills 
and ability in terms of Enron in either Latin America, North America or 
Europe.  Joe indicated you were the right person to discuss this with. I have 
moved my family a few too many times in the past 24 months. I can not afford 
to keep bouncing them around so I will need to make sure this is the best 
decision at this time for Enron and myself. We were in Sao Paulo last year 
and the city is fine but the questions will be for how long?, accomplishing 
what with my career? and will the position maximize my value. 

Let me know if you have an extra minute.

871,"Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and 
complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk 
of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions 
with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.  
Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial 
people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back 
and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and 
standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it 
helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the 
long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, 
less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. 

A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get 
in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth 
et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized 
delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't 
quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish 
some of these goals as well.

what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

Well, you finally gave a speech that topped the one you gave at Linda's and my rehearsal dinner.  You did an outstanding job (as did Carrin), and it was obvious you were speaking from the heart.  I know you would prefer not to have all of this attention, but it comes with the territory.  It sure made me proud to see you up there, and congratulations on the accomplishment.

952,"Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB
Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
""The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market,"" FERC said in its draft order. ""Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate."" 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, ""given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California."" 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was ""extremely successful,"" adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
""The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States,"" said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
""We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region,"" said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
""Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent,"" said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. ""We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.'' 
Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at (270) 688-6968, Mark Elliott at (270) 688-6637 or Dale Sanders at (270) 688-6944. More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at <http://westernfrontier.williams.com> .

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order.

																											New  Pipeline Interconnection to Offer Canadian Supply
																											
																											
																											
																											?  ? Empire State Pipeline and the National Fuel Gas have  completed a new 
Canadian pipeline interconnection at Pendleton, NY,  allowing natural gas to 
flow to the US from Canada. The volumes from  Canada could flow to the 
Buffalo area market as well as to NFG's  interconnects with Tennessee Gas 
Pipeline in East Aurora, NY and  Ellisburg, PA; Dominion Transmission in 
Ellisburg; and  Transcontinental Pipeline and TETCO at Leidy. Empire Pipeline 
is  owned by ANR and Westcoast Energy's St. Clair Pipelines. ANR  Pipeline 
serves as the physical operator for Empire Pipeline, which  extends for about 
156 miles from Buffalo to Syracuse. Most of the  natural gas will come from 
Western Canada, and the new pipeline will  give more flexibility and supply 
options for Empire's shippers.

Darnay Scott <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&! ow! ner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1212&>, WR CIN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01
Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week. 

James Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1820&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin! Updated 11/23/01
According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/23/01
Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
The Jacksonvil! le! Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury. 

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/23/01
Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01
Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback. 

Rod Smith <http://footba! ll! 222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/23/01
Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week. 

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01
Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133291&> , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/23/01
Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week. 

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1054&>, QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=187568&>, WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1267&>, WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1790&>, WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.

James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.

Travis Minor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=235123&>, RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of ! a ! disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=133384&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=2763&key=1471&>, RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.

Message Text:  High Inventory System Wide Operational Flow Order (SWOFO)


      OFO Stage :                        3
      Inventory Level :                 High
      Noncompliance Charge :    $5.00/Dth
      Tolerance Band :                0%
     

PG&E's CGT has called a High Inventory System Wide OFO for flow day 11/23/2001.

High Inventory:  Customer supply is required to be within the tolerance band percentage of daily
usage to avoid OFO noncompliance charges.  Supply lower than usage is not subject to OFO
 noncompliance charge.

Charges for Noncompliance:

-   Noncore customers with AMR and PG&E's Electric Generation charges are based on actual
    daily metered usage.
-   Noncore customers without AMR charges are based on ADQ
    or actual daily metered usage, whichever results in a lesser charge.
-  Core Procurement Group charges are based on the latest core load forecast.


Please call the CGT Helpline 1-800-343-4743 if you have any questions.

physical change due to deal changes with the HPLC Operational desk. This desk 
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel, gas loss, and physical UA4, we 
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the 
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be 
allocated. What we found out that happened was that in the last week of 
February and in the first week of March Sitara added volumes to these tickets 
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes.  Darren 
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them 
out.  Darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it 
were a deal between HPLC and Texas, but it is actuall as if we changed a deal 
that we did with another region.  The value was offset by changes in TUFCO 
and storage.  We released $270,000 out of March prudency to keep you flat for

Apparently, HPL cut a deal to purchase this gas at ""HPL meters"" at Rocher and Big Cowboy #2, so the gas had been pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe.  All along, these volumes have been flowing into the GEPL/Big Cowboy system and on to King Ranch.  Tom and I spoke with Clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and determined that a Transport Usage ticket needed to be put into place, as IM Wellhead, to transfer the volumes from HPL to GEPL and into the plant.  

We unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the HPL purchase to the TU tickets and moved the gas on our transport on GEPL to the plant, effective April 1.  This resolves our overproduction issues for April and forward.

Please let me know if you have any further questions, comments, or information to add.

Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we 
stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get 
this assigned?  I can find old
   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let 
me know. Unresolved - appears to be unassigned?

Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for 
ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1. Unresolved

MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and 
Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with 
transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it 
stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I 
thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.  Unresolved

Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:

 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left 
unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed 
appropriately.  Someone
  needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, 
that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified.

 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This 
issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot 
allocate was is
  not pathed and nominated.  Unresolved or Unpathed?

 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point 
specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 
10,000).  This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the 
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this 
transaction, we are not legally covered.  Carlos was handling this pipe in 
Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan? Unresolved

HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December 
and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back 
next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return.

HPLC currently has a gas purchase agreement (global #96014987) in place with 
Calpine that extends through 5/31/2001.  Sitara deal no. 133259 correctly has 
this contract attached to it.  Effective 11/1/1998 the contract was amended 
releasing Gouger wells no. 5 & 6.  These wells were apparently the only 
producing wells behind this point.  Evidence being no measured volumes in 
MIPS.  There are however other non producing wells behind this point.  Is 
your Sept & Oct UA4 issue the direct result of volumes being scheduled at 
meter no. 4229?  If so, for November, the nom at this point will be taken to 
1mmbtu/d until the wells behind this point began to produce.

As far as meter 6835 (Roos #1 C/P) is concerned, HPLC also has a contract 
(#96003771) in place with Cokinos Nat Gas that is currently in an ""evergreen"" 
status.  The aforementioned wells were released from the Calpine contract; 
however, they were not added behind meter 6835.  Therefore, I do not agree 
that the deal (133259) should be edited to change the meter.

Hopefully this information is useful!

Per your request here is the VA with the leaning towers removed and the 90 
day ramp up also removed.

Discounting the leaning towers, there is a slight variation (generally<.1%) 
between the EA term in this report and the EA term in the reports the owners 
may have seen.  This is because the owner reports are corrected for SCADA 
counter resets while this dataset is not.  We are in the process of 
implementing a fix for this variation which includes storing the validated 
counter data in our database but that will not be complete before the AWEA 
meeting.

If you show this data to owners at AWEA the folks from Trent may object as 
they will consider our availability should include leaning towers.  By the 
same token the sites where we did not negotiate a 90 day ramp up may object 
as our availability should include the turbines from commissioning.

table structure should be.  In addition, after discussing the status messages 
it is important to differentiate between those which effect availability and 
those that do not.  The FAULTS table includes a flag field INCLUDE which 
serves this purpose for STAR. 

A improvement to this table would be to add a counter description field 
var(4) which would hold one of the following descriptions; SOT, LOT, DT, WOT, 
MT, RT, and EST.  This will allow us do differentiate status messages by 
which counter they are associated with.

Since the intent is to mirror the SQL Server and the STAR db we need to make 
these changes to both.  I'd like to get the SQL server changes ASAP so I can

1104,"As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that ""any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification"" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
""fixed"" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California 
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  ""Just and reasonable"" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the 
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew,

1106,"Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law 
bullets this morning.  A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and 
Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).  LG&E's 
gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into 
Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.   Rockey 
and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good 
arguments for avoiding the liability.  The unexpected (and unmetered) 
deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance 
during the referenced 3 month period.  Accordingly, I assume the cost of 
replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should 
not affect earnings.   I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this 
matter.  DF  ",Steve LG&E Law,"about $500,000",MMBtu PRA
1107,"PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources

Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both
companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will
acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free,
stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western
Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE
subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n
named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, 
Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including
its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into 
Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders.

Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated
equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including
conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new
holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western
Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of
approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total
enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9
billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for
as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's
earnings per share and cash flow.",,"approximately $1.503 billion approximately $2.939 billion $4.442 billion approximately $6.5 billion $2.6 billion $3.9

1111,"Jeff,
Thank you for the referral of the Citizens Kingman, Arizona project to Enron 
Asset Management Resources (EAMR), the new ETS service company, for further 
development.  We appreciate your willingness to ""stay in the loop"" with the 
project since you have the relationship with the customer.  

It is not often that we have the opportunity to take over the operation of a 
facility before in-service.  This is a great opportunity to operate assets 
that do not have a long and potentially risky environmental history, so we 
are excited about this opportunity.

This bid proposal is envisioned to be a joint effort between Operations and 
Market Services to:
Identify the functions required to perform the requested services
Price the delivered services
Identify the risks associated with performing the services 
Mitigate and/or price in adequate compensation for the risks

As the project is kicked off, we enter the information gathering stage to 
determine the configuration of the facility and the service requirements.
I have placed a call to Citizens to initiate this effort and will keep you 
informed of developments.

Julia, 
I am assuming that Donna Scott will be the primary contact for this joint 
development and that she will coordinate Market Service's efforts, therefore, 
she is copied on this e-mail.  Let me know if you have any changes to this 
approach.

treating/processing
  approx. 170 mmcf/d of throughput currently; significant growth expected

   EBITDA:  $40mm/yr
   Rex Kouri (sp?) is the founding equity in Sulfur River  (I haven't heard 
of him, but they acted like I should have) 
   An outfit named ""Energy Spectrum"" put $30 mm in equity into Sulfur River a 
few years ago and thinks now would be a good time to cash out
   $90 mm in debt
   $1/mmbtu gath/proc. margins

upstream assets in the area, would make an interesting combined play.
   Koch was asking $200 mil. for their gathering assets a year ago or so--I 
don't know if its the exact set of assets that Pat and Jerry were suggesting 
we'd want to include in the package.

The two guys involved are Pat Keeley, of Friedman Billings and Ramsay in DC 
and Jerry Langdon (the ex-FERC Commissioner), who is an investor/dealmaker.

we are pretty much locked into that approach.  On the commercial issue Rita 
mentions below, it seems to me that Elizabeth Brown has the commercial 
impacts backwards--the marketers have always told us they are able to 
negotiate higher rates if LESS CAPACITY is posted as available because of the

strategic decisions on presentation, and make all of the presentations tic

handle Shell, but an expedited approach should be doable with the right 
spin.  However, I am concerned that the base case you agreed with Johanas is 
no longer accurate given the status of Laine's negotiations.

I did not understand specifically your question about cash below.  Could you

Hi Molly!!

1186,"The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains my notes on selected items on various days.

effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn

 submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for

 made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
 Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from

NOTICE: COH OFO/OMO

Date Issued: December 11, 2000 

As a result of returning cold weather and significant under-deliveries by 
shippers on the Columbia Gas of Ohio (COH) system, COH is calling an 
Operational Flow Order and an Operational Matching Order (OMO) for all COH 
Gas Transportation Customers. The OFO/OMO is effective on gas day December 
13, 2000 and will remain in effect until further notice. If conditions 
warrant, these orders will be lifted to reflect the changing conditions and 
COH will advise you of such changes. Customer and marketer banks are not 
available during the OFO/OMO period. 

This notice is applicable to the Customer Choice program. CHOICE deliveries 
should always equal the customers demand curve. The OFO requires the same 
level of delivery, but the tariff provides for additional costs for failure 
to comply.

Customers with daily measurement devices are subject to the OMO. Those 
customers or their shippers are directed to adjust the customer's consumption 
and/or their deliveries to COH so that their deliveries to COH are equal to 
the customer's actual consumption.

Customers without daily measurement devices are subject to the OFO. Those 
customers are hereby directed to adjust their daily scheduled deliveries to 
COH so that those deliveries are equal to 60% of the customer's maximum daily 
volume as specified in the customer's gas transportation contract with COH.

Those customers or their shippers who fail to comply with this OFO/OMO shall 
be subject to penalties for the difference as provided for in COH's tariff. 
COH will continue to monitor weather conditions and demand, in order to 
remove the OFO/OMO as soon as possible.

If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact your Columbia Gas 
Representative.

1243,"I'm forgot, what do you need at Tenn O&R for tomorrow?",,,
1244,"Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the 
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as 
possible.  This means using as few ""formula based"" curves as possible and as 
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or 
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but 
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating 
transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are 
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could 
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The 
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index 
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue 
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES 
business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using 
""formula based"" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport 
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and 
how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings 
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16
CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are 
two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which 
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other 
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more 
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.  
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads 
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know 
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it), 
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work 
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

Re: TETCO Phase II/PCB Filing 12/01/01

On October 31, 2001 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation 
(TETCO) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP88-67 to 
reflect an estimate of TETCO's Year 12 PCB related costs.  
Included in the filing were revised rates under TETCO's Rate 
Schedule X-28 which Transco utilizes to render service under its 
Rate Schedule S-2.  The revised rates have a proposed effective 
date of December 1, 2001, and if accepted as proposed would 
result in the following changes in Transco's Rate Schedule S-2 
rates: 

Demand Rate 			- $0.0100 increase
Demand Charge Adjustment - $0.0008 increase

1289,"This is just FYI-

I think we really need to ask Dan, Judy and Chris to dedicate some time to 
map the market area points accurately.  (What I mean is making sure each 
location has the proper valuation attached to it in Sitara.)  Just so you 
know, when I print out the market area transport p&l, there are 85 
tickets/paths set up, and only 19 of those show a positive p&l.  I know that 
we are not using that much transport that is out of the money--I'm sure this 
is just a case of no one going in and making sure the mappings for each 
location in the market area are accurate.  I would just go ahead and do this, 
but I I do not know the market area points and valuations well enough.  There 
are a few simple things I could point out that need fixing (i.e., TCO pool vs 
TCO citygate--as prices go up and cost of fuel goes up, no one is adjusting 
the curves between the two points, so your transport starts out in the money 
and ends up out of the money; another example is CNR--the gathering charge on 
CNR is now $.44, but we still have our curve set at TCO pool minus $.32.)

Anyway, I know the market area is a bit more difficult because of valuation 
issues, but I have to believe we could do better than 19 out of 85.  (And on 
some pipes, like Tennessee, the ration is 0/33).

I know this is a pain to fix, but one day I do envision that we will have 
automatic notification of capacity being in or out of the money, but that 
will be meaningless if we are not set up to value points properly.

of the protocols.

Currently, ERCOT calculates ancillary service obligations for each QSE
for a given trade day based on the QSE's aggregated Load Ratio Share as
of the same day of the prior week.  This results in the use of QSE/LSE
relationships from one week prior to calculate ancillary service
obligations.  When an LSE switches from one QSE to another, the
obligation associated with its load continue to be allocated to the old
QSE for one week after the effective date of the switch.  The same
obligation does not get allocated to the new QSE for the first week
after the switch.  QSEs also do not have access to Load Ratio Share data
per LSE that makes up their ancillary service obligations.

This modification will alter the way the QSE Load Ratio Shares are
aggregated so that ancillary service obligations are calculated based on
the QSE/LSE relationships that will be effective on the trade day for
which obligations are being posted.  Load Ratio Shares will be
calculated and saved by LSE during the data aggregation process run for
initial settlement of the trade day in question.  QSE Load Ratio Share
will then be aggregated and posted for a given trade day based on the
sum of LSE Load Ratio Shares calculated as described above corresponding
to the most current QSE/LSE relationships for that trade day.

Scheduled Extract Changes:  Billing determinants for LSE Load Ratio
Shares called LRSLSE will be added to the load extract.  Each QSE will
have the LRSLSE fields added to its load extract for each LSE it
represents.  Each LSE will also have the LRSLSE field added to its load
extract with its Load Ratio Share information.

Dynamic Extract:  The Settlement and Billing folder within the archive
extracts area of the portal will have an additional dynamic extract
folder added called ""Obligations"".  This dynamic extract folder will
have two extracts called ""QSE obligations"" and ""LSE obligations"" which
can be used to query Load Ratio Shares by QSE and LSE.  The following
ERCOT total quantities will also be added to the dynamic extracts above:

?        Total obligated non-spinning quantity (NSOTOT)

?        Total obligated regulation down quantity (RDOTOT)

?        Total obligated responsive reserve quantity (RROTOT)

?        Total obligated regulation up quantity (RUOTOT)

DVD time huh?  I like my player, but there is a substantial premium for it.  
And actually, Sony has come out with the next evolution of the mega DVD 
changer.  I think it lists for $900, but can probably be had for $600-$700 
range.  It is also huge.  I'm not trying to talk you out of it, just let you 
know of the downside.  Both models have identical specs, so quality is not an 
issue.  Let me know if you have anymore questions.

I met this man's wife, Nadia Rodriquez, in orientation.  Here is what she 
said about her husband's work experience.

""My husband just finished his MBA and his company's moving to Atlanta.  He 
has been offered two positions there but we would rather stay here.  His 
background has been in the securities industry, most recently in compliance 
where he ensures that brokers follow NASD and SEC regulations in all aspects 
(e.g. trading, marketing, etc.).  Prior to the compliance role, he was a 
broker with PaineWebber.  Also, he has extensive computer skills and is used 
to dealing with all levels of personnel.""

I found out that Silver Creek is a very small resort close to the town of 
Granby, CO.  It is acutally 15 miles north of Winter Park and 2 miles south 
of Granby along Hwy 40.  We are staying at a condo there from Sunday night 
(11th) thru Thursday night (15th).  I indicated we would like to go to Winter 
Park because we have been there and it is close.  We want to ski 2 days in 
Silver Creek and 2 days somewhere else.  If you can make it during the week 
to Keystone, then yes we will go there instead of WP.  I would love to go to 
an Avs game, but we will probably need to be on the road by late afternoon on 
Sunday.

Once again, we get in on Saturday (10th) about 9pm.  That's pretty late so we 
may or may not be able to do anything that night.  We will leave on Sunday 
(11th) for Silvercreek and be back in Denver at your place on Friday (16th).  
Then our plane back to Houston is early Saturday (17th) morning.  If you can 
get away during the week to ski, that would be awesome.  Thanks for all your 
hospitality.  See you soon.

Enron entity.  Under Enovate LLC I need two books:  FT-ENOVATE and 
INTRA-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  I also need a book which will fall under the 
current Enron MW, LLC counterparty:  FT-INT-ENOVATE (P,B,I & GD).  And as 
usual I need these as soon as possible.  I will be out of the office on 
Friday but will return on Monday.  I really need to get deals moved to these

1336,"Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Well i am glad that you are still with the firm. I know how you feel cause i
have friends at Enron who tell me the same thing. Infact my brother works
for UBS Warburg in London and he does not know whats going on also.

I am working with a few recruiters but have not received good leads from
them. Actually I never thanked Andy Zipper for referring me to MRE so i
would appreciate if you could let him know how much that helped me out.

<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

The Dollar stood strong and Equities were boosted by a positive
consumer sentiment survey as trading slowed down ahead of the
Christmas holiday.  A late flurry in Cattle, Hogs and Bellies
featured commodity markets, with Cattle pushing to a two-week 
high.  Silver continued to shine as lease rates stayed firm, 
and Gold followed in symnpathy with the Argentina situation a
background factor.  Another rally attempt by Coffee on Thursday
was dashed, Cocoa ended quietly mixed, while Cotton ended with
small gains but a soft undertone.  Book squaring jimmied Energies.
Soybeans were flat, Wheat mixed and Corn down on export
uncertainties.

1375,"Dear Leaf and Mark,

",Leaf Mark,,
1376,"We have some new opportunities with Modesto Irrigation District in Northern 
California.  MID is their own schedule coordinator (SC id for caps -- MID1), 
and has a very flexible system that we can frequently help them run more 
efficiently.  MID has partial ownership in San Juan, and can buy in the SW at 
PV or Mead 230(some wheels to San Juan may be needed).  MID also has the 
capability to buy/sell in the SW or at Capt Jack in the NW and then buy/sell 
respectively with us in NP-15.  MID's real time # is 1-209-527-3185, the RT 
guys at MID are not marketers, they are system reliability folks(dispatchers 
like EPE--old school), be aware and prepared for this when talking to them.  
If we are going to make use of their system flexibility, we should set it up 
WELL ahead of time with Blair Jackson(209-526-7505) or Matt 
Ray(209-527-8001), it also would likely be helpful to reference these two 
when talking to the dispatchers.  

We have also had BPA build us some new account #'s that may help you.  They 
are as follows

1378,"Listed below are dates and actions required to finish the year-end PRC 
process.  Please make a note of these dates and perform any required 
actions.  If you have questions, please contact me.

December 15:  All PRC meetings and ratings will be finalized for Sr. Director 
and below positions.
January 25:  Performance reviews must be completed by this date.  All 
performance review information, including bonus payment and salary increase, 
must be communicated to employees.
February 5:  Bonus payment made to eligible employees.

Since we have many new employees, I thought I would provide the following 
information and philosophy about our performance review system.  Enron is 
very proud of its employees and is known for hiring the most talented people 
available in the marketplace.  I believe that is true in West Power Trading.  
The challenge for managers is to provide valuable feedback, and the most 
accurate rating, to employees so they can enhance their performance and 
progress in their current roles and within the company.

There are basically two objectives to our performance review system.

Career Development/Feedback on Performance:  This part of our performance 
review system includes the meetings and discussions surrounding the following 
four documents that are in each review package:  Goals, Expectations, 
Accomplishments, Feedback.  Employees prepare a listing of their Goals to 
accomplish by the next review period and a list of their Accomplishments 
since the previous review period.  Managers prepare Feedback and prepare a 
list of Expectations during the next review period.  These documents are the 
cornerstone for constructive two-way feedback during a performance review.

Performance Rating:  Enron uses a merit-based approach to determine 
promotions, raises, and bonuses.  This is accomplished in the PRC 
(Performance Review Committee) meetings.  In these meetings, the ENA 
management team assigns a performance rating to each employee.  We attempt to 
make this process as fair and objective as possible.  For West Power Trading 
employees, each person's performance is assessed relative to responsibilities 
defined in the ""Expectations"" document.  Performance is also gauged relative 
to your peers throughout ENA--Portland, Houston, and Calgary.  Each person's 
manager had tremendous input into this process.  I personally represented 
each person in our group in the final ENA PRC meeting in Houston.  I feel 
confident the process was fair and that the tremendous achievements of our 
office were acknowledged.

The following is a review of the various rating categories.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Does not meet most expectations.  Demonstrates some of 
the criteria.  Further development needed in most areas.

SATISFACTORY:  Meets many but not all expectations.  Demonstrates most of the 
criteria.  Further development needed in many areas.

STRONG:  Meets most and exceeds some expectations.  Role model for some of 
the criteria.  Further development needed in some areas.

EXCELLENT:  Exceeds most expectations.  Role model for most criteria.  
Further development needs are minimal.

SUPERIOR:  Consistently goes above and beyond expectations.  Role model for 
criteria.  Very little need for growth and change at current level.

My commitment to you is that by January 25, you will receive your 
career/development feedback and your performance rating.  Hopefully this 
information aids you in understanding the PRC review system.  If you have any 
questions about the process, please see your manager or me.  Also, Amy 
FitzPatrick would be happy to answer any questions you have or provide 
assistance with the PRC Process.","Amy 
FitzPatrick",,Sr Career Development/Feedback on Performance Feedback Enron Performance Review Committee ENA ENA PRC the PRC Process

1380,"Did you know a $96 donation provides two school-age youth access to programs 
that foster resiliency by developing caring relationships, demanding high 
expectations, and providing opportunities to participate in family, school, 
and civic life?  The United Way-funded Youth Development Program at the Boys 
& Girls Clubs of Portland Metropolitan Area promotes positive values, useful 
skills and self-esteem.  It is one of many United Way-funded programs that 
help youth achieve success.

Visitors to the Boys & Girls Club in Hillsboro fell youthful energy in the 
air the moment they step through the front door.  Children ages 6 to 12 flock 
to the club each morning during the summer to shoot pool, play air hockey, 
practice kickball and much more.  Youths ages 12 to 18 serve as junior staff 
members, lending a hand to regular staff and retreating to the center's teen 
room when they need a break to chat with their peers.  Club Director Darrin 
Marks explains that the club hosts about 100 students everyday during the 
school year and 200 students daily in the summer.  The club has operated in 
Hillsboro since 1992 and offers a wide variety of programs for kids.  Summer 
sports activities include flag football, soccer, floor hockey, basketball and 
baseball.  Other features at the club include an arts and crafts room, a 
newspaper club, a science club, dance classes, and a Discovery Room with 
several computers donated by Intel.  For a nominal fee, the club provides a 
healthy lunch, a safe place to have fun and exposure to interesting sites in 
the metropolitan area that youth might not see otherwise.  The Hillsboro club 
is just one of eight sites sponsored by the Boys &  Girls Clubs of Portland 
Metropolitan Area.

I received this from my friend Chris who is a music lover and I thought this
was a worthy cause to pass on to you.  No Napster means no more downloading
music off the internet.  You can easily send an email from the Napster
website to your state representative.  So speakout! and pass it on.

1394,"There have been many occasions where individuals have not saved the model at 
the end of the day.  This means that the last one...two...FIVE hours are not 
updated.  I then have to go back and enter the data off the historical 
scrapes as well as the actual econ deals themselves.  You can imagine how 
frustrating this is for me......   It's VERY EASY to save the model and time 
consuming to update it all after the fact.  Besides annoying me, it also 
looks bad to EPE when they get a model that is wrong.  Do not forget to 
save!!!!!!  It is completely sloppy and totally unacceptable.  Save and save

1395,"Group,
A quick reminder.  When doing a buy/resale where we are purchasing from a 
counterparty, please make the buy price the price you pay the counterparty 
and the sell price the price the counterparty pays you.  So for a $5 
buy/resale at 130/135 the legs would be a buy at $135, and a sell at $130.  
In scheduling you will see a positive price of $5.  A negative price in 
scheduling represents US getting paid.  If you have questions please ask.

Thanks,

1396,"Hey Guys. 

I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the 
ZP26/NP15 Buy-Resale on a Realtime basis. We are not doing a profit split 
this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to 
shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has 
Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the 
SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA's capacity is 21MW, 
but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know 
about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So 
by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA. 

The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. 
And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour. 

IN CAPS:
We sell to NCPA in ZP26.  
We buy from NCPA in NP15.

We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to 
ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL).
PG&E is NCPA's SC, so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call.



NCPA's tel#: (916) 786-3520
PG&E tel# : (415) 973-1969

If you guys have any questions  just ask me.

how about them Lakers !!!     There is only one thing I can say..... or
maybe 3 words.     MEN AGAINST BOYS !!.      Didn't they just kick ass!
They are peaking at just the right time.     The Dodgers are in first place
and the Kings have gone beyond everyone's expectations.   Life is good in
Southern California.

On the down side,  Ramon got admitted into the hospital over the weekend.
It started out as a  problem with very low blood sugar but then escalated
into a weak heart problem with very shallow breathing.   They have him on a
respirator and plan to wean him off of that this morning.   Cita is all
stressed out but thank god that one of her neighbors is spending the night
with her.      We're getting an update today on some tests performed on
Ramon, so we'll know alot more.

Cita is doing fairly well.    I took her for a four hour heart exam last
week and it revealed that her last heart attack caused some arterial
damage.    The doctor said that if she was younger, he would perform
angioplasty.    In any case, her spirits are remarkably high and is still
mentally sharp.

On another matter,  I got a call last Friday from Ford Motor Credit
regarding your account.    They left a number and asked if you could call
them because ""they have not been able to reach you"".     The number they
left was 877-873-0085.      Apparently, you left me as a reference on the
application.

Hope you are doing ok and am looking forward to seeing you in June!

When importing/exporting or wheeling energy through California, it is 
important that the schedule ID is included in the inc or service sheet.  
Further, if an import/export or wheel is cut real-time (ie. over the phone 
after hour ahead finals are out), an email should be sent to volume 
management and such cuts or other occurrences should be noted in your day or 
night notes.  This information along with the real-time tag number allows 
other members of the West Desk (and those following you on shift) to do their 
job quickly and more accurately.  I understand that many of you are working 
long shifts and combating systems issues at the same time.  However, it is 
not acceptable to delay members of other groups because of a failure to 
communicate information readily available to us.

To make sure we are clear on this, the expectations are as follows:
      
 AN ORGANIZED AND COMPLETE INC/SERVICE SHEET AT START END OF SHIFT WITH 
SCHEDULE ID'S AND RT TAG #'S
 AN EMAIL TO VOLUME MANAGEMENT CONCERNING RT CUTS ON RT IMPORTS/EXPORTS AND 
WHEELS
 COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF THE DAYS EVENTS IN THE DISCUSSION NOTES

An inability to communicate with volume management or settlements is a 
performance issue.  I already receive reports on disputes and deal entry 
errors.  In addition, I will be asking volume management and settlements to 
provide feedback on each trader during the review process.

Thanks,
Bill

1460,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

of e-commerce initiatives made by the Association in the last year.

Quite a few members in attendance at the AGM expressed interest in acquiring
the CD Rom.  These members were sent follow-up materials regarding pricing
and the ordering process last week. Announcements were sent to Primary
Contacts and members of the Documentation and Operations committees as well.


ISDA would now like to give the Board the opportunity to acquire the CD Rom
for their organizations.  Below is a summary of some features the Library of
Interactive Documentation provides:

  * Installation on company intranets for use by employees
internationally

 * Search all documents in the library simultaneously

 * Locate key terms within and between documents quickly

 * Easy access to sections, subsections and appendices

 * Reduce expenditures on booklets by having one pool of
information to be used company-wide

The Library of Interactive ISDA Documentation is licensed for one year from
June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002.  However, ISDA is offering members an
additional month of free usage if a license is purchased now.  The license
fee for Primary Global members is $15,000 USD per year.  The fee for Primary
International members is $10,000 per year.  The terms and conditions of the
license are detailed in the license agreement attached along with the CD Rom
order form.

As the Board is aware, ISDA's goal is to listen to industry professionals
and its membership and address their needs. The release of the Library of
Interactive ISDA Documentation addresses the needs of the Association's
membership not only by providing pertinent information, but also by making
that information available in a format consistent with the way ISDA members
do business today.

To submit your order form please complete and return by reply email or by
fax on 212 332 1212. I can be reached by telephone on 212 332 1205 should
you have further questions.

ISDA backs push for legal certainty
IFR - April 28, 2001

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association is backing an
international movement aimed at increasing the legal certainty of
collateralised transactions. With cross-border collateralisation growing,
lack of clarity over which jurisdiction applies to dealings in
indirectly-held securities presents legal risks, said Kimberly Summe,
assistant general counsel at ISDA in New York.

ISDA has joined with 16 other international organisations and 119 legal
experts to put together a proposal aimed at recognising the law of the
location of the intermediary maintaining the account to which the security
is credited as the applicable law in collateralised transactions. They hope
to have a text for adoption within a year.

The current Basle bank capital reform process is putting collateral in the
spotlight.

""lf a bank views collateral as difficult to get hold of, then it will value
it less. And it may need to increase reserve requirements with respect to
the loan secured by that collateral."" said Morgan Burkett, chief legal
officer at Cygnifi Derivatives Services in New York.

Canadian Central Bank Downgrades Forecast for 2001 Economic Growth
BNA - May 2, 2001

OTTAWA--The greater than anticipated economic slowdown in the United States
has forced a downward reassessment of Canada's economic growth prospects in
2001 to between 2.0 and 3.0 percent, the Bank of Canada said May 1.

The U.S. economy is now projected to grow by between only 1.0 and 2.0
percent during 2001, even with the boost that will be provided by the
expected growth of between 2.0 and 3.0 percent during the second half of the
year, the central bank said in its semi-annual Monetary Policy Report. The
bank had indicated in a Feb. 6, 2001, update of its last semi-annual report
that it expected the Canadian economy to grow by about 3.0 percent during
2001, based on U.S. growth of 2.0-2.5 percent.

""It now looks as if growth over the first six months will average between
1.25 and 2.25 percent. For the second half of the year, we see growth
picking up significantly to between 2.5 and 3.5 percent,"" the latest report
said. ""The pace of activity in 2002 is expected to be somewhat stronger than
in the second half of 2001, with the economy expanding at a rate slightly
above the Bank's estimate of potential output growth of 3.0 percent.""

Meanwhile, the anticipated re-emergence of excess supply in the Canadian
economy will contribute to continued downward pressure on core inflation
during the remainder of 2001, and core inflation is expected to average
slightly less than 2.0 percent for the remainder of 2001, then to increase
to about 2.0 percent by the end of 2002, the Monetary Policy Report said.
Increases in the overall Consumer Price Index are expected to remain
volatile over the next few months, but then to also fall to about 2.0
percent by the end of the year if world energy prices remain near current
levels, it said.

The central bank stressed that the main risk to its projections for the
Canadian economy remain the timing and strength of the projected resurgence
of the U.S. economy, and the report noted that it will continue to monitor
developments closely and make further adjustments to its trend-setting Bank
Rate as necessary.

""For example, if consumer and business confidence in the United States does
not improve, this could lead to weaker consumption and investment spending,""
it said. ""Another development that the Bank will have to watch closely
because of its possible implications for aggregate demand and inflation in
Canada is the shift in international financial market sentiment that has led
to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar and other
currencies.""


SEC Urges More Use of Fair - Value Pricing
The Wall Street Journal - May 2, 2001
By Judith Burns

U.S. mutual funds can't rely on stale prices when calculating the value of
their portfolios, a senior Securities and Exchange Commission attorney said.

In a letter to the Investment Company Institute, a leading fund-industry
group, Douglas Scheidt, general counsel of the SEC's investment-management
division, said funds should be on the lookout for events that might require
them to use fair - value prices for certain securities, rather than relying
on the last quoted price.

Mr. Scheidt said funds can't ignore major changes affecting pricing that
occur after trading closes but before the calculation of the net asset value
of the securities in fund portfolios.

Mutual funds typically compute their NAV once a day, after the close of
securities trading in major U.S. markets, using readily available
quotations. When that isn't possible, funds must base calculations on the
fair value of a security.

When calculating fair-market value, the SEC said funds should use
appropriate methods to determine the price they might reasonably expect to
receive in a current sale. It recommended funds compare fair-market pricing
results with the next-day opening prices or actual sales prices to refine
their pricing techniques and avoid using market quotes from dealers and
pricing services that prove unreliable.

""Funds that automatically use market quotations to calculate their NAVs
without first verifying that the market quotations are readily available
cannot be assured that the resulting NAVs are accurate,"" Mr. Scheidt wrote
in his letter dated Monday.

Accuracy could be called into question if a fund ignores developments in
markets such as Tokyo or Hong Kong, which close 12 to 15 hours ahead of the
U.S. closing, the SEC attorney said.

Market swings, natural disasters, terrorist activity or a major change in
government or policy could have dramatic effect on foreign securities
prices. If a fund determines a significant event has occurred after a market
closes that would affect the value of a security it holds, the fund must use
"" fair value pricing methodology,"" rather than the closing price, when
valuing its portfolio, said Mr. Scheidt.

""Funds can't just put their head in the sand,"" Mr. Scheidt said yesterday in
an interview.

The ICI said it plans to distribute Mr. Scheidt's comments to its members.
""The letter will be useful in providing guidance to the funds on this
matter, "" ICI spokesman John Collins said.

Fair - value pricing isn't limited to non-U.S. securities. In cases where
trading in a U.S. security is halted, or there is a significant development
after an early market close, funds should no longer rely on the closing
price or last quotation when calculating their NAV, according to the SEC
staff letter. On the other hand, where market quotes are deemed reliable, it
said funds must continue to use them and can't switch to fair - value
pricing.

Fair - value pricing has been controversial for funds in recent years. In
the fall of 1997, there was an outcry from investors who complained they
bought and sold shares without realizing some fund companies, including
Fidelity Investments, relied on fair - value pricing after Asian markets
swooned. Fidelity calculated an increase in the value of its Hong Kong and
China fund using fair-market pricing.

Investors could be harmed if a fund doesn't use fair - value pricing, since
it could generate arbitrage activity that dilutes shareholder value, the SEC
letter noted. If the fund's NAV doesn't reflect up-to-the-minute changes,
shares could be overpriced, benefiting investors who sell their stake while
harming those who overpay to acquire shares. Conversely, if the fund is
underpriced, sellers would suffer at the expense of buyers.

"" Fair - value pricing can protect long-term fund investors from short-term

Additionally, the SEC urged funds to provide investors with more information
on when and how they will use fair - value pricing, saying ""plain English""
disclosure could reduce shareholders' complaints about the practice and
discourage arbitrage activity.

Small frys curbed
Business Standard - May 2, 2001
By Sangita Shah

The introduction of individual stock futures and options to replace the
carry forward system will drive out the small retail investors from the
stock markets, market sources said.

According to market participants, while derivatives as instruments have
always been an alien system to the Indian market, the technicalities
involved will leave domestic investors bewildered.

The introduction of index futures in June 2000 can be termed as anything but
successful. This can be proved by the fact that the average daily volume of
sensex futures has not crossed Rs 10 crore. Even Nifty futures, which has
performed better in terms of liquidity, has barely registered an average
daily volume of Rs 12 crore. This is a fraction of the cash market turnover
of Rs 5,000 crore collectively, in a stable market.

""Lack of understanding as to how the derivatives in stock markets are to be
operated is the major roadblock, in the success of the futures and options
market in our country,"" Bhavin Shah, a derivatives trader at a domestic firm
said.

In fact, even the LC Gupta Committee has noted in its report in March 1998
that "" derivatives are not always clearly understood. A few well-publicised
debacles (sic) involving derivatives trading in other countries has also
created widespread apprehensions in the Indian public's mind.""

While economic literature recognises the efficiency enhancing effect of
derivatives on the economy in general and the financial markets in
particular, the Committee felt the need for educating public opinion, as
also the need to ensure effective regulatory checks.

""It is worth mentioning that while regulatory checks have been implemented,
it has failed to educate public opinion. Under the circumstances, it is
probably high-handedness on the part of the authorities to thrust upon them
an alien system without giving an opportunity for smooth transition,"" a fund
manager said on conditions of anonymity.

However, the fact should also be considered that if futures and options in
individual stocks are introduced in the country, India will be among the
handful of global exchanges which have these systems. The problem is
compounded by the fact that there are few international precedents for India
to draw on in the matter of options and futures in individual stocks.


The difficulty of defining a default
Euromoney - April 2001

It's not difficult to see why the market is so taken with credit default
swaps. For the protection buyer, they are a quick and easy way for investors
worried about a particular credit risk - whether originally taken on via
bonds, loans, ~ trade notes, or derivative counterparty exposure - to gain
reassurance without having to dispose of assets. For sellers of protection,
default swaps provide the opportunity to buy into sectors to which they may
have little or no exposure, while avoiding the need to make a large capital
investment up front. The buyer pays a premium to the seller in return for an
agreement that, if a default occurs, the seller ~ pays a sum equal to the
value lost and assumes _ ownership of the defaulted assets.

For their part, dealers enthuse about being able to amalgamate limited
liquidity in different parts of the market and convert it into a readily
tradable instrument. ""One of the big advantages of credit default swaps is
that they are in pure derivative form,"" says Glenn Barnes, global co-head of
credit derivatives at Merrill Lynch. ""It's not like credit insurance where
you have to suffer a loss before you get paid.""

Credit default swaps have quickly become ~ the largest component of the
credit derivatives market, making up over two-thirds of global business.
According to Merrill Lynch, the credit derivatives market accounted for $893
billion of notional value in 2000, a figure estimated to top $1.58 trillion
by 2002. ""Derivatives are now absolutely central to the whole credit
benchmark,"" says Tim Frost, European head of credit derivatives at JP
-Morgan. ""Bond issues cannot be priced without knowledge of credit swap
prices.""

While the threat of a bear market lingers, -credit default swaps can only
grow in popularity as investors seek to insulate themselves against risk.
""Up until three years ago, the -only liquid protection from risk available
to bond investors was to -. go short on bonds and hope they got cheap enough
to buy before they had to deliver,"" says Gordon Black, a -managing director
in credit derivatives at Bear Stearns.

However, because the credit default swap market is now taking centre stage,
the structure of swap agreements is coming under much closer scrutiny.  At
the heart of the debate is the question how to define a credit event. In
1999, reacting to continued confusion in the market over the issue, the
International Swaps & Derivatives Association (ISDA) published a list of
conditions, each of which is sufficient on its own trigger a swap agreement.
These credit events are bankruptcy, failure to pay, restructuring
repudiation or moratorium, obligation default and obligation acceleration.
At the time of publication, ISDA stated that these definition ""were critical
to the growth in demand fro credit derivative transactions.

For a while, this kept market participant quiet. Although most felt that the
arrangement was by no means perfect, they were happy to use ISDA's list as
the basis of their credit default swap contracts. Having a blueprint for
swap agreements attracted greater numbers of investors with no previous
experience of default swaps, and liquidity boomed. But it wasn't long before
the flaws in the plan began to surface. At the end of 2000, following a year
of catastrophic results and event risk, US-based financial-services company
Conseco restructured over $~ billion of debt. With the agreement of its
banks, it extended the maturity of its bonds and loans until the end of
2003. Under ISDA rules, this triggered  default and banks that had written
protection for parties exposed to Conseco found themselves having to pay
out.

""Initially, we were fairly confident about ISDA including restructuring
instead of the old 'material change'. We saw it as a step on the road to
default,"" explains Black. ""But people failed to recognize at the start that
restructuring is not the same as default. You can't demand par value in the
case of a default. This exposed the seller not only to credit risk, but
market risk as well.""

In response to growing dissatisfaction with ISDA's guidelines, some market
participants have gone about simplifying matters unilaterally. Dealers at a
number of major US houses have decided to remove restructuring from the list
of credit events included in credit default swap contracts. There is a
liquid market for these swaps in the US, which trade at a discount to those
with a restructuring clause. Other institutions have attempted to establish
a market in swaps that carry a more limited definition of default. Enron, an
energy trader that is also a large dealer in credit markets, is trying to
build a market in pure bankruptcy contracts, where bankruptcy is the only
event that can trigger payment.

Regulators are warning investors to pay particular attention to the contract
when they enter a credit default swap deal. Even banks aren't immune from
confusion. Last month it emerged that UBS Warburg was suing Deutsche Bank
over an unpaid obligation. UBS bought protection from Deutsche on Armstrong
World lndustries, which meant that if AWl defaulted on its payment or went
bankrupt, Deutsche would have to pay UBS $so million. In December, A\XTI
filed for bankruptcy but in the meantime it had undergone a reorganization
and created a holding company. So when UBS applied for payment from
Deutsche, the German bank refused to pay on the grounds the name on the
contract didn't match the name of the entity that had defaulted. The dispute
nearly ended up in court.

In London in February at Euromoney Institutional Investor's International
Bond Congress, David Clementi, deputy governor of the Bank of England,
voiced concern about the rapid growth of the credit derivatives market.

""It is intrinsically more difficult to standardize the definition of a
credit event compared with that of a price or interest rate - the underlying
for most other derivative products,"" he said. ""Market participants will
therefore have to pay even greater attention to documentation.""

It's all in the contract
Credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service, too, has expressed concern
that investors don't always know what they are buying. ""When investors enter
an agreement with a derivatives trader, they're talking to someone who works
with these products full time. So they're getting into something fairly
technical with a dealer who knows much more about the subject than they do,""
says Isaac Efrat, managing director in the structured finance department at
Moody's. ""Investors always enter the market from the same direction, of
wanting to sell protection, whereas dealers tend to hedge everything. The
risk has to go somewhere and my guess is that it's going to investors,"" he
continues.

Bankers, unsurprisingly, dispute this, saying that the rating agency is
underestimating investors' knowledge of the structures. ""Frankly, I think
people do understand the risks very well,"" says Barnes at Merrill Lynch.
""Some of the most recent entrants to the market, pension funds and hedge
funds, have quickly picked up how credit default swaps work."" Others say
that the whole point ~f default swaps is the exposure to risk. ""Moody's is
raining on the parade,"" says a credit derivatives trader. ""Credit default
swaps-are supposed to synthetically create the risk profile of a bond. The
buyer acquires the risk and is paid for it.""

But most admit that there are kinks in the market that need ironing out.
Most of these are to do with one particular type of credit event.
""Restructuring is where things come unstuck,"" says a market participant.
""The current restructuring clause in credit protection is more in favour of
the buyer,"" says Antonio di Flumeri, director of credit derivatives at
Deutsche Bank. He believes that a company's restructuring shouldn't give
rise to a default. ""Banks holding loans and protection have the opportunity
to realise a windfall gain by restructuring those loans to trigger the swap,
then delivering a cheaper asset to the seller of protection,"" di Flumeri
says. Barnes agrees. ""From the dealer's perspective, it isn't fair if the
holder of the asset consents to the restructuring of a loan but this then
triggers a credit event payment,"" he says. ""This gives the bank

Without such protection, financial institutions would lose out on capital
relief. An alternative, which has found more favour among bankers, is to
place restrictions on what is deliverable in the case of a restructuring.
Under present arrangements, if a bank sells a five-year protection on a loan
or bond with the same length maturity and that debt subsequently needs to be
restructured, the original lending bank can agree to any terms it chooses.
It might, for example, allow a company to extend its debt to a maturity date
of 30 years in the future.

Because a restructuring has taken place, that bank can then exercise the
default swap and
the seller of the protection ends up owning 30-year debt. This can be a real
problem if that investor has been marking the bond or loan to market. ""What
is cheapest for the buyer of protection to deliver may cause problems for
those who have sold protection,"" says Black.

The answer may be for ISDA to set a limit to the time over which debt can be
restructured, perhaps restricting it to the same maturity as the original
loan, or two or three years beyond it.  This would limit bankers' discretion
and help redress the balance. ""The question is, can we convince the banks
that this isn't limiting their ability to restructure?"" asks one trader.
""They're going to say: 'What, you're telling me I can only restructure over
two years? That's not much of a restructuring'. They'll ask for 10, we'll
say three, maybe we'll settle on five.""

Whatever the outcome of this debate - as Euromoney went to press ISDA had
not yet announced its conclusions - it needs to be resolved quickly.
""Everyone realizes that something has to give,"" says a credit derivatives
trader. ""This market has only existed for three years and there's only been
any sort of meaningful liquidity for two. The last thing we want to do is
shoot ourselves in the foot."" Unless an agreement is reached soon, there's a
real danger that the emergence of default swaps without restructuring in the
US could lead to the establishment of a two-tier market. Certainly, the
possibility of Europe excluding restructuring is a remote one, ""I've tried
to do credit default swaps without it a couple of times in Europe and it
just doesn't work,"" says one derivatives trader. So that leaves it to the US
to back down. Or does it?

""European investors do often tend towards European names and the same
situation occurs in the US and Asia,"" says a banker. ""In theory, each
jurisdiction could have its own treatment. This wouldn't be a disaster, but
it would affect liquidity."" Moody's Efrat says: ""I can easily envision a day
when there will be a wide range of credit default swap contracts determining
what counts as a default.""

Stephen Selig, counsel at Baer Marks & Upham, goes further. There is no
reason why contracts shouldn't be specific to particular deals, he says.
""Unless I'm missing something, I really don't see why the scope of the
protection, and what gives rise to a trigger of the swap, can't be part of
the individual contract between the buyer and the seller. ISDA tries to
cover every eventuality and all you get is a long and unreadable list of
conditions.""

For the sake of practicality, not to mention liquidity, it seems likely that
ISDA will come down on the side of a single set of criteria. ""The market
needs a standard product,"" says Black at Bear Stearns. ""You don't want to
have to compare documentation every time you do a credit default swap
because different jurisdictions have different standards."" Participants want
to use credit default swaps for different purposes: some want to hedge
receivables, others use them as a synthetic asset class and others still to
hedge loans. So a blueprint is also essential to avoid exploitation of new
entrants in the market. ""At the limit, if everyone developed a contract
which suited their own needs perfectly, there would be no trading at all,""
says Frost at JP Morgan.

Opinions are divided on whether this debate is causing a slowdown in the
credit default swap market. Says Deutsche Bank's Flumeri: ""Volumes are the
highest they have ever been so I don't think the debate is having a
significant impact."" But, according to another trader, ""If there was a
universally accepted contract for credit default swaps, volumes would
explode.""

But whatever ISDA announces, this is likely to be some way off. ""If people
are expecting credit swaps to be as vanilla as interest rate swaps then they
are sadly mistaken,"" says Frost at JP Morgan. ""I expect to have retired
before there is one standard contract that everybody around the world uses.""

Ontario Treads Cautiously Along Its Toilsome Path Toward Deregulation



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis






[News item from Reuters] Ontario, Canada's plan to open its electricity mar=
ket to competition could happen earlier than the May 2002 target date, but =
the earlier timing is contingent upon the completion of a key report, a spo=
kesperson for the province's energy minister said earlier this week. ""It's =
opening. We're just waiting to set a date and full steam ahead,"" said Chris=
tine Smith, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Energy, Science and Technolog=
y. Ontario's government will make the decision regarding the start date for=
 competition once the readiness report, which documents the preparedness of=
 all the agencies involved in the privatization process, is completed and r=
eviewed by both Energy Minister Jim Wilson and Premier Mike Harris.=20

Analysis: The fact that the start of electric competition in Ontario, Canad=
a's most populous province, may actually be on the near horizon is a major =
development, considering that deregulation in the region has been in the wo=
rks-and has encountered several delays-since 1998. Shaken by the fiasco of =
direct access in California, along with the sudden price spikes that occurr=
ed in Alberta (Canada's only fully opened market), officials in Ontario hav=
e been rather reticent to proceed with dismantling the monopoly system in t=
his region. However, it now appears that Ontario is finally moving forward =
with its deregulation plan, despite concerns from some of the major players=
 in Canada that officials in the region have orchestrated what may become a=
nother troubled experiment in electric deregulation.=20

Before discussing the current deregulation plans in Ontario, it is necessar=
y to establish some key points about Canada as a whole, the province of Ont=
ario in particular and trends within the energy market of the Great White N=
orth. From a national perspective, electric deregulation in Canada is occur=
ring on a province-by-province basis (much like the United States is deregu=
lating its market on a state-by-state basis). At this point, only Alberta h=
as deregulated its electric market, which occurred in January 2001. Beyond =
Ontario, none of the other Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, =
New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Sas=
katchewan, or Yukon) have taken any definitive steps toward deregulating th=
eir electric markets and instead are approaching deregulation from a ""wait-=
and-see"" perspective. Part of this reticence toward deregulation among othe=
r Canadian provinces besides Alberta and Ontario relates to the generally l=
ow energy prices across Canada and the fact that the regions within the nat=
ion are vast and rather isolated from each other (thus making the issue of =
transmission interconnection a challenge). Ontario is an exception to this =
general rule, as the province has experienced relatively high prices and is=
 interconnected with other provinces and the United States.=20

As noted, Ontario is the most populous Canadian province, the home to 11 mi=
llion people with an average power usage of 155 terrawatt hours a year, and=
 representing a $10-billion electric market. The three main utilities in On=
tario are Ontario Power Generation, the former Crown-owned utility that was=
 formed by the replacement of Ontario Hydro Services Company with separate =
commercial companies in April 1999 and currently controls a total generatin=
g capacity of approximately 25,800 MW; Ottawa Hydro, which is owned by the =
city of Ottawa; and Toronto Hydro, which was created as a result of the con=
vergence between six utility companies serving Toronto. Toronto Hydro consi=
sts of a transmission and distribution unit and an energy services company,=
 but owns no generation of its own. Of the three, Ontario Power Generation =
has the market share in the province, reportedly serving about 85 percent o=
f Ontario's power market.=20

Deregulation of Ontario's natural-gas market took place in the late 1980s. =
Following plans that had been in the works since at least 1998, electric de=
regulation in Ontario was originally scheduled to begin in November 2000, a=
lthough it was postponed another 18 months due to concerns from officials a=
fter witnessing the well-documented problems in California. Energy Minister=
 Jim Wilson reportedly was also concerned about Alberta's experience with e=
lectric deregulation. Competition in Alberta's wholesale and retail power m=
arket began on Jan. 1, 2001, a time at which wholesale prices for natural g=
as were staggeringly high. High demand and short supply in Alberta caused r=
ates in the province to immediately double upon the onset of deregulation, =
a development that has naturally given great pause to other Canadian govern=
ments. Natural-gas and electricity prices in Alberta have since fallen dram=
atically, as elsewhere in North America, but not before the Alberta governm=
ent was forced to give hefty rebates to customers to compensate for the sha=
rp increases.=20

Under Ontario's evolving deregulation plan, retail markets will remain unde=
r the oversight of the Ontario Energy Board, the provincial power regulator=
, and are scheduled to open at the same time as wholesale markets. Under th=
e retail system, customers will have the option of arranging their electric=
ity purchases directly from suppliers at fixed-price contracts, or having e=
nergy purchased for them by distribution companies, agents, brokers, or mar=
keters at fluctuating prices. Most reports indicate that Ontario is well po=
sitioned to open its market to competition, at least from a supply perspect=
ive; in fact, Ontario government officials have claimed that the province h=
as adequate power supply, fueled mostly by hydro and nuclear energy, along =
with planned investments in new generation. However, other observers have c=
laimed that the delay in the start date for competition in Ontario is servi=
ng as a deterrent for new generation investments in the region. Reports fro=
m earlier in 2001 indicated that Ontario will need an additional 1,000 MW o=
f generation in addition to its existing capacity of 26,000 MW to meet dema=
nd, and only one 450-MW plant had been officially announced.=20

In addition, despite the assurances from the government, some companies hav=
e claimed that the deregulation policy outlined by the Ontario Energy Board=
 is fundamentally uncompetitive. For instance, one company that appears to =
have very little interest in the new opportunities in Ontario is Calgary-ba=
sed TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., Canada's largest natural-gas pipeline compa=
ny and a huge player in the country's regulated marketplace. One of the key=
 criticisms that TransCanada officials have raised is that the Ontario gove=
rnment is implementing a policy in which the bulk of Ontario's high-quality=
 generating assets will remain controlled by Ontario Power Generation, leav=
ing only undesirable plants on the auction block. In other words, even in a=
 deregulated market, Ontario Power Generation may continue to hold the mark=
et share of generation in Ontario. TransCanada claims that this approach wi=
ll diminish investment interest in Ontario and do little to entice new gene=
rating companies from entering the province. TransCanada, which has previou=
sly made acquisitions of natural-gas fired plants in Alberta and the northe=
astern United States, does not think that the province will offer a very co=
mpetitive market and appears to have little interest in moving into the Ont=
ario electric market. Note that in mid-October, Mirant Corp. (NYSE: MIR) an=
nounced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase the majority of t=
he gas marketing business of TransCanada, making it the largest natural-gas=
 marketer in Canada and the largest natural-gas exporter to the United Stat=
es.=20

Under the Ontario Energy Board's deregulation plan, Ontario Power Generatio=
n must sell or lease 4,000 MW of its non-nuclear power within 42 months of =
the opening of the Ontario market. Currently, Ontario Power Generation owns=
 9,700 MW of fossil-fuel capacity; 8,728 MW of nuclear power; and 7,309 MW =
of hydroelectric power. Obviously, the governmental mandate regarding the d=
ivestiture leaves the bulk of the province's generating capacity under the =
control of Ontario Power Generation, which is a major point of contention f=
or potential competitors.=20

It is important to note that the office of Ontario Energy Minister Jim Wils=
on does not share TransCanada's perspective. In fact, a spokesperson for th=
e office said generation assets such as the Mississagi hydroelectric system=
 and the gas-fired Lennox plant in southwestern Ontario, both of which Onta=
rio Power Generation will be divesting, represent very valuable assets that=
 should be a desirable way for companies such as TransCanada to enter the d=
eregulated market. Also note that TransCanada has expressed concerns only a=
bout opportunities in Ontario's electric market, and the company already ha=
s rather extensive gas-pipeline investments in the province. Nevertheless, =
enabling the opportunity for new companies to gain generating assets curren=
tly owned by Ontario Power Generation is a key factor to the success of Ont=
ario's deregulated market.=20

Moreover, Ontario inches ever closer to a competitive electric market, but =
a good number of concerns about the province's plan for deregulation remain=
 unresolved. There is great anticipation for the report that is expected sh=
ortly from the Ontario Energy Board, which may specifically address the div=
estiture policy for Ontario Power Generation that has troubled companies su=
ch as TransCanada. Certainly, there is great hope that no further delays of=
 the deregulation start date in Ontario, and that province officials either=
 maintain or accelerate the May 2002 start. Just as Canadian officials have=
 closely watched the move toward deregulation in the United States, U.S. co=
mpanies continue to monitor Canada's slow, province-by-province progression=
 toward competition. As noted, Mirant Corp. already has gained a market edg=
e in the natural-gas sector of Canada by acquiring the assets of TransCanad=
a. Duke Energy, Calpine Corp. and Devon Energy have also penetrated the Can=
adian natural-gas market with pending acquisitions of Westcoast Energy, Enc=
al Energy and Anderson Exploration, respectively. The next horizon for the =
Canadian energy market is electric deregulation, and industry eyes remain o=
n Ontario as the only Canadian province that is following Alberta into elec=

Please let me know the names of the people to be appointed to represent the Caycos in Brazil.  As a suggestion, I think that we have been appointing the following people on the POAs:  Orlando Gonzalez, Brett Wiggs, John Novak and you.

I will be happy to prepare the POAs--please confirm that you need them ONLY for the second group of companies listed below.  Currently I am involved in the CEG closing which should take place Monday and Tuesday, November 26 and 27.  (Also,  the office will be closed Thursday and Friday this week for the Thanksgiving Holiday.)  I will be able to focus on the POAs after that.  As you are likely aware, it will require the preparation of two sets of resolutions and POAs for each limitada.  Once the POAs are signed, and the we receive the check from accounting to pay the fees at the Brazilian consulate, the POAs will be at the consulate for 3-5 days.  Therefore, I would expect that if everything goes smoothly we could get them to you by sometime around December 7 or December 10.

If you need them before that date, perhaps we can find someone who can help me by preparing the documents for each company from a basic draft, which I already in a form which is very close to what we'll need.

IssueAlerts LIVE FROM THE CIS CONFERENCE NEXT WEEK 

Next week I will be attending the 25th Annual CIS conference in  Albuquerque, 
N.M. On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, I will be writing  SCIENTECH's daily 
IssueAlert directly from the floor of the conference,  providing you with the 
latest news and analysis about emerging technologies  in the energy industry. 
Key issues to be addressed at the conference  include CIS / CRM activities, 
billing strategies and billing software,  meter reading, the application 
service provider (ASP) model, and a  technology forecast for the industry. 
Each day at the conference I will  select the most important issue of the day 
and provide you with the  independent analysis that you've come to expect 
from IssueAlert. So even if  you can't attend the conference, you can still 
participate in the dialogue  and information exchange. --Will McNamara 

Peace Software announced that it will join with IBM Global Services to 
deliver large-scale and advanced technology solutions to utility and retail 
energy companies operating in regulated and deregulated markets. Using 
""state-of-the-art and proven approaches,"" IBM Global Services and Peace 
Software will plan, develop, test, and deliver customer-specific 
implementations of Peace's Energy suite. Services will span the life cycle of 
an installation from rapid deployment through production site enhancement and 
maintenance. Peace and IBM have secured a contract to provide full customer 
management services for Xcel Energy, which expands upon a strategic alliance 
that has already existed between the utility and IBM. 

Analysis: Both Peace Software and IBM have been aggressively pursuing the 
same customer management space for some time. The fact that the two companies 
have now come together to combine their unique skill sets establishes a 
strong competitive force in this fast-growing arena, which can include 
outsourced billing, meter reading, data collection, customer care, CRM, and 
CIS systems. IBM Global Services, as an information technology services 
provider, brings an operational and management capability for back-office 
requirements. In turn, Peace Software provides a unique suite of billing and 
customer data software that many utilities are purchasing as they move from 
legacy systems to more flexible solutions. 

As noted, Peace Software and IBM Global Services immediately followed the 
announcement of their partnership with a new multi-million, five-year 
contract with Minneapolis, Minn.-based Xcel Energy. Under the contract, the 
two companies will implement Peace's Energy suite to support Xcel's 3.5 
million regulated and deregulated electricity and gas customers located in 11 
Western and Midwestern states. In addition, the Peace suite will be used to 
support Xcel Energy's participation in Texas' deregulation pilot program, 
which begins in June. The project will replace Xcel Energy's mainframe and 
client / server legacy system. The implementation plan for Xcel Energy 
includes all customer management, commodity billing and Internet components 
that are offered in the Peace Energy software. 

The contract with Xcel expands upon an already-established alliance between 
IBM and the utility that dates back to 1995 (IBM originally contracted with 
Public Service Co. of Colorado, an early predecessor to Xcel Energy). Under 
the $400 million, 11-year alliance, IBM has provided data-center operations 
and disaster recovery for Xcel Energy, including networking, help desk, PC 
and LAN support, distributed services support, and application development 
and maintenance services. Through the agreement, Xcel Energy awarded IBM 
""preferred provider status,"" making IBM the vendor of choice for any IT 
products and services that the utility may need.  

In this next phase of the partnership with Xcel, IBM appears to be moving the 
focus on a mainframe and client-server system to a packaged product for Peace 
Software. This is a major step for Xcel, as many utilities still retain 
internal control over their own applications and are reticent to outsource 
these functions to an outside company. In addition, this is a huge deal for 
Peace and IBM as they may be planning to eventually extend the platform 
beyond the partnership with Xcel. 

In fact, Xcel Energy is just the latest in a growing list of competitive 
utilities and energy companies that have outsourced or replaced their billing 
/ customer care needs. In competitive markets, a prerequisite for the 
continued growth of an energy company or utility is a comprehensive billing 
software system that can handle the complexities of an unbundled environment, 
which is where the value of Peace Software comes in. Most competitive retail 
providers realize that they must be able to provide customers with online 
energy usage and billing data on a 24/7 basis. Further, as competitive energy 
providers operate in different states, it is important that they eliminate 
the different automated and manual processes that are common in legacy 
systems. This can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it 
can eliminate back-office functions such as taking calls for final reads and 
address changes, all of which can be handled directly by the customer through 
online software.  

An energy company basically has two options with regard to billing / customer 
care solutions. The first option is for the energy company to purchase the 
billing software directly from a software provider such as Peace and manage 
its own billing needs. The second option is to completely outsource the 
entire billing / customer care services to a company such as IBM Global 
Services. By joining forces, Peace Software and IBM are anticipating that 
energy companies will be inclined to not only select the Peace software, but 
also opt to use IBM Global Services' implementation and management services.  

Peace's Energy software, which reportedly is being rapidly deployed in 20 
transitioning energy markets around the world, is designed to provide several 
self-serve features, including customer enrollment, summary billing, more 
flexible due dates and electronic payment options. The Energy suite was 
developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling many 
functions required by retailers, from enrollment and registration to billing 
to settlement and load forecasting. The last two features are particularly 
noteworthy as, up to this point, they have been rarely found in billing 
software. Many systems in the United States today are building this 
competency or are ""bolting on"" the technology; Peace already offers it in an 
integrated tool. 

Peace's Energy Version 6 software, which was released in December 2000, is 
billed as the first e-business solution to integrate customer and commodity 
management. The upgraded features of Energy Version 6 include B2C e-commerce 
functions, an advanced third-generation browser user interface (BUI), 
enhanced billing capabilities and expanded industry-standard support for the 
Oracle 8i database system. The result of these technical improvements, 
according to Peace, is a ""capability to exploit the latest Web browser 
technologies to support and streamline large scale, mission-critical customer 
service operations."" Further, the Energy software is centered around the UNIX 
operating system and thus can be moved and upgraded from one hardware 
platform to another. The Energy software can accommodate billing services 
around natural gas, electricity, water, home security, and home mortgaging. 
The end result is that an energy service provider can group all of its 
services into one bill stating one cost, which is a market edge against 
competitors that only provide multiple billing. 

On its own, Peace Software has become a dominant player in the energy billing 
software market, offering its ""one-stop-shop"" billing tool to a variety of 
utilities and energy companies. Peace boasts customers such as AEP, 
MidAmerican Energy, Enron, BC Gas, Dominion Retail, Nordic Electric, Exelon 
Energy, and Pepco Services. Peace has also entered the Canadian gas market by 
implementing its Energy suite at BC Gas, headquartered in Vancouver. The 
company is based in Miami and maintains a large presence in its country of 
origin, New Zealand, the first country to deregulate its electric utility 
market. 

The company has used strategic partnerships as one method of growing its 
business. Prior to this partnership with IBM Global Services, Peace Software 
announced in early April an alliance with Exolink, a provider of retail 
energy business process integration services. Under this partnership, Peace 
and Exolink are marketing a platform for energy retailers in both regulated 
and unregulated markets in which customer data can be shared in and out of 
multiple markets. Peace also just signed a contract with Delinea, a vertical 
services provider, in which Delinea has licensed Peace's Energy software as a 
customer management application targeted at mid-sized utilities.  

However, the billing / customer care market is arguably one of the most 
competitive businesses to have emerged from electric deregulation. 
Consequently, the list of competitors that Peace Software and IBM Global 
Services face grows literally every month. I cannot list all of the 
competitors here, but a few are worth mentioning as they have grown at a 
similar pace to Peace and IBM. Such competitors include Alliance Data Systems 
(ADS), ConneXt, Enlogix, Excelergy, Itron's MV-PBS, LODESTAR, Orcom 
Solutions, SCT Banner, SPL Worldgroup, and US Power Solutions. Some of these 
companies offer just the software solution, which is licensed to utilities or 
energy companies, while others serve as the outsourced management company 
that implements the software package. The partnership between Peace Software 
and IBM Global Services runs parallel to similar partnerships between ADS / 
Excelergy and Enlogix / SCT software. 

Currently, SCIENTECH is witnessing a trend away from large license-only 
agreements and into Strategic Sourcing agreements. In the customer care field 
today, Enlogix is the largest application service provider with over 3 
million end customers in production today. Orcom is the second largest, with 
over 1 million ""live"" customers. Realistically, it will be about two years 
before Peace and IBM are able to fully migrate all of Xcel's 3.5 million 
customers to the Peace software. However, if this transition materializes, it 
could represent the largest outsourced customer care contract to date.

* Sri Lanka Plans To Deregulate Broking Industry
* Battle For The Benchmark Is On
* Swiss bank offers 'Gore' and 'Bush' derivatives

Reuters - November 9, 2000
Sri Lanka Plans To Deregulate Broking Industry

Sri Lanka plans to deregulate its broking industry and to allow for
specialised brokers who will promote new risk instruments, the director
general of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) said.

""We are looking at the deregulation of the stock broking industry to allow
free entry and exit,"" Hiran Mendis told a forum of business leaders late on
Thursday.

In the current system, the CSE board advertises slots for broking licences
and approves eligible applications.

""We will allow brokers to do more investment banking, margin lending and
dealing on their own account, and are also considering brokers doing their
own underwriting,"" Mendis said.

""Brokers' fees are too high due to the lack of diversification in
activities,"" Mendis said.  The CSE has been badly hit by an exodus of
foreign equity capital this year due to an escalation in Sri Lanka's ethnic
war.

Average daily trading volumes were down to about 25 million rupees last
month, half the volume from earlier this year.

The key Colombo all share index opened around 493 on Friday, up from the low
of the year of 427.62 in May but down from the year's high of 574.26.

The CSE also plans to introduce derivatives , short-selling and securities
lending from around September 2001.

At present, Sri Lanka's 15 broking firms act only as agency brokers while
having some leeway to extend margin lending facilities and to trade on their
own account.

Mendis said brokers would also be allowed to segment their activities, with
some offering trading facilities and others, clearing and settlement
services.

""We also hope to introduce Internet trading in the next three-four months,""
Mendis added.

Financial Times - November 10, 2000
Battle For The Benchmark Is On:

The French government bond market has benefited from the launch of the euro,
but possibly not as much as it might have liked to, according to market
strategists. When the introduction of the European single currency did away
with currency risk among the participating countries, France set out to
topple Germany from its position as the benchmark provider for the European
government bond market.

Germany has maintained that position mainly as a result of the strength of
its currency, the D-Mark, as well as the reputation of its central bank, the
Bundesbank.

But, with the first no longer an independent entity and the second stripped
of its monetary policy remit, the battle for providing the new euro-zone
benchmark has been thrown open.

So far, the outcome is inconclusive. Market participants praise the French
government debt agency France Tresor for its transparent information policy
and efficient debt management at a time when falling budget deficits and
windfall earnings from the sale of mobile phone licenses are reducing
European
governments' need to borrow.

""It is certainly the case that the information policy of France Tresor is
better than that of the various bodies in Germany,"" says Daniel Pfandler,
bond strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. ""But Germany remains the
benchmark in 10- and 30-year issues, whereas in the two-and five-year
maturities one could argue that France is ahead.""

France's deficit is expected to fall to 1 per cent of gross domestic product
next year, excluding the projected receipts from UMTS mobile licences.
Including those receipts, France expects a small surplus.

However, there should be little impact on bond issuance as UMTS receipts -
expected to amount to some Euros 20bn - are spread over several years.
France has also embarked on an active debt management programme in order to
boost liquidity even as financing requirements fall.

That includes the activities of agencies such as the Caisse d'Amortissement
de la Dette Sociale which re-finances the debt of France's social security
system and will continue to be active in the market.

But although France has emerged as the leading European issuer in some
maturities and some types of bonds, many investors especially outside the
eurozone, continue to regard Germany as the point of reference for
euro-denominated government bonds.

Germany's competitive advantage in the 10-year maturities is underpinned by
the liquidity in the Bund futures market on Eurex, the Swiss-German
derivatives exchange, which is perceived as the European market leader.

But the French policy of releasing issuance schedules up to a year in
advance with bond auctions held regularly every month is seen as superior to
Germany's quarterly schedules. France has also traditionally provided a more
regular supply of liquid issues over the whole range of maturities from 2-to
30- year
bonds.

""France has always had liquid issuance's spread much more evenly across the
whole of the yield curve,"" says Nathalie Fillet, bond strategist at BNP
Paribas.

The five-year BTAN is now widely regarded as the benchmark trading at the
same or a slightly lower yield than its German counterpart, the Bobl.

France has also led the way in launching the first euro-denominated index
linked bond, known as ""OATi"" and runs the most developed market for
""strippable"" government bonds - which can be split into their component
parts of coupons and principal. Even so, French bonds in parts of the yield
curve still trade at a
spread over the German government's Bunds, meaning that France is borrowing
at a more expensive interest rate than Germany.

""The French curve offers more steady large issuances, it is very transparent
and from the French Tresor's point of view, that should certainly be
producing narrower spreads,"" says Padhraic Garvey, senior bond strategist at
ABN Amro in Amsterdam. ""But the French curve is regarded as a spread
product, because the German market is seen as the anchor to the system for
historic reasons.""

Mr Garvey said that this year, spreads between German bunds and other
European government bonds have widened as a result of increasing worries in
the market over the quality of European monetary union.

Those fears were exacerbated by the relentless slide of the euro on the
foreign exchange markets.
Greece's decision to join the euro next year, while Denmark has decided to
stay out, has further shaken investor confidence. The launch of euro notes
and coins in 2002 is likely to help allay fears that monetary union could
break up, and that is likely to produce tighter spreads between European
government bonds.

documentation where appropriate.  But a lawyer needs to review all power 
confirms for the time being (physical and financial) to make sure that the 
product is being properly defined.

2.  In terms of power product definition, Milly has raised valid concerns 
which warrant legal review, which are market opening risk, change in market 
rules between now and market opening, and the size of the transactions being 
entered into.  There is also the inherent risks of the PPA, in essence 
interrutible risk.  All these risks need to managed at the front end.  i.e. 
Once a deal is executed by the trader, the lawyer cannot fix it after the 
fact.  Although the power traders or originators should already understand 
these risks for the product when they are transacting, please meet with 
Davies and Zufferli ASAP to ensure that they are cognizant of these risks 
when they are transacting.

3.  Please check our corporate resolutions to make sure that they cover off 
execution of confirms for power transactions in a similar fashion to gas 
transactions (i.e.  anything over a year must be signed by Milly, if it is 
less than a year it can be signed by Zufferli as the responsible trader or 
Davies as the responsible originator).  I note, however, for the time being, 
at least until the market opens, Milly wants to see all power trades 
regardless of tenor.

SmartEnergy Rounds Up $15 million in Financing; Is an IPO in the Works?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

SmartEnergy announced that it had completed its Series A round of financing,
having received funding from an investor group including strategic utilities,
venture capital and global banks. SmartEnergy, a privately held Internet-based
energy service provider active in New York, plans to use the funding as
working capital to ""rapidly ramp up to meet an aggressive deployment 
schedule.""

ANALYSIS: You may recall that I discussed SmartEnergy about a month ago
(IssueAlert, Oct. 11), when I drew attention to the fact that the online
start-up was taking customers away from ConEdison. In existence only since
April 1999, SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential
and small business customers. Under a promotion currently under way in
New York, SmartEnergy has guaranteed savings of up to 40 percent on energy
through the winter months for natural-gas customers in the boroughs of
New York City and Westchester County. Capitalizing on ongoing threats about
low supplies of oil and natural gas, SmartEnergy is using the so-called
""energy crisis"" to lure customers away from the traditional utility by
locking in current natural-gas rates over the course of the next 12 months
under its ""Smart Fixed Rate"" plan. As a policy, SmartEnergy hedges the
products that its sell to customers, so that neither the company nor its
customers is exposed to energy market price risks. In addition, SmartEnergy
has offered 500 United Airlines Mileage Plus Reward Miles as an enticement
to secure customers.

As I discussed last month, an advantage that online energy providers such
as SmartEnergy have over traditional utilities is their agility. As utilities
try to disengage themselves from regulatory-bound rate structures, online
companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products
and billing options to customers. In addition, operating online allows
SmartEnergy to easily operate in geographically disparate markets. Up until
now, SmartEnergy's marketing efforts have been concentrated in New York
state. However, the company claims that it will be serving six states,
including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, by the end of this year. SmartEnergy
expects to be serving all 25 deregulated states by the end of 2001, and
the financing that it has received from investors undoubtedly will support
this anticipated growth.

Venture capitalists apparently agree that a company like SmartEnergy offers
a unique business model that could potentially lead to financial returns
as the energy industry continues to become deregulated. Investors that
are bankrolling SmartEnergy include Alliant Energy, WPS Resources Corporation,
Avian Securities and several other unidentified private investors. In 
addition,
there is a European contingent that is part of the Series A round, including
Dexia Ventures, the private equity arm of Dexia Bank, a USD $211 billion
asset bank based in Belgium; KBC Bank; and venture capitalist groups Trust
Capital, Proseed Capital Holdings and Technoledge Ventures. The inclusion
of both American and European investors is important. Coupled with 
SmartEnergy's
intention to operate in all 25 U.S. states that are deregulating, the fact
that the company also has European investors suggests that SmartEnergy
plans to be an energy provider on both sides of the Atlantic. The fact
that SmartEnergy operates completely online lends itself to a platform
of worldwide service. In fact, Alliant Energy identified ""the strong growth
of the Internet and technology in the energy segment"" as a key reason why
it is financially supporting the growth of SmartEnergy.

In fact, the alliance between SmartEnergy and Madison, Wis.-based Alliant
has been in existence for several months. The utility's non-regulated 
subsidiary
Alliant Energy Resources formed a strategic partnership with SmartEnergy
to expand a decidedly e-focused business. The partnership with SmartEnergy
represents Alliant's new drive to forge strategic alliances with companies
offering state-of-the-art technology and new products and services for
customers. In fact, Alliant has referred to SmartEnergy as ""the energy
company of today and tomorrow"" and believes that it has a platform that
can be replicated for fast growth in markets around the world.

Of course, my question is whether or not we are seeing the wheels turn
toward an imminent IPO from SmartEnergy. It would certainly be an obvious
move for the private company to head in this direction, especially now
as technology stocks are being received favorably by Wall Street. I've
written pretty extensively over the last few weeks about companies like
Evergreen Solar, Active Power and Capstone Turbine all issuing very solid
IPOs as a result of, in my opinion, their business models in new technologies
and / or alternative fuels. There is arguably a general perception within
the financial community that energy companies incorporating new technologies
into their business models will gain an increasingly strong lock on the
energy market in the next two years. With few exceptions, energy companies
exploring new technologies that have issued IPOs over the last several
months have performed comparatively well.

As commercial and industrial customers want various service options that
reduce their dependence on traditional utilities and the transmission grid,
start-up companies like SmartEnergy might find a very profitable niche.
Perhaps the greatest marketing edge that SmartEnergy has is its customer
service, again resulting from its online presence. Customer interaction
can be conducted via the telephone or over the Internet, enabling 24/7
account access and the ability for customers to check their accounts at
any time.

The downside, of course, is customer reluctance to sign up with a start-up
company that they may not know. In addition, SmartEnergy faces tough 
competition
from other online energy providers that also are gaining momentum in 
deregulated
markets, including Utility.com and Essential.com. None of these companies
has yet gone public, and are instead focusing on building critical mass
and establishing their brand identities. Yet, of the three, SmartEnergy
may be the most aggressive in terms of expansion, and could be on the fast
track to an IPO in the near term.

Top Legal Risks

1.  Power Forms -  Trading contracts in the power industry are very weak.  
Typical problems include, trading under multiple masters, no liquidated 
damages for non-delivery, no events of default or calculation of termination 
damages, broad performance outs.

2. Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent 
acting on behalf of several operating companies. This creates uncertainty as 
to which entity is liable for which trades.

3. Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities.

4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a 
result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing.

5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on 
a very tight time schedule.

6. Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on 
how to document transactions involving power.

7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure 
everybody understands risks associated with transactions.

Documentation Projects

1.  EEI - cont'd work to make EEI the trading contract for power/lessen 
reliance on WSPP.

2.  One-off Power Form - creation of contract to be used for individual 
transactions that are not part of a master.

3. Product Definition - cont'd work on creating/building acceptance for power 
product definitions.

4. Platform Trading - Encourage use of EEI as trading platform for all 
e-trading.

5. Single master contract for all physical commodities/financial trading  -  
work with ISDA to develop single contract for physical trading and then roll 
that into single contract for physical and financial trading",,,WSPP ISDA

I know that we will talk on Monday but thought that I would give you some 
preliminary thoughts on Randy's e-mail.

I can work with Randy's proposal that South America report directly to you.  
I respect Randy's ability to be a ""honest broker"" (a function of both his 
""stature"" and the fact that he is an ""Enron guy"").  I don't know John Novak 
as well but, from his reputation, believe that he could probably serve the 
same role if and when Randy transitions to a new role at Enron.

I see two competing considerations for me.  

First, India may make the same argument given their support of Sanjay's 
broadband efforts and I'm less confident that Sandeep Katwala will have the 
political muscle (given his personal desire to do more broadband work across 
Asia, his fairly imminent return to Linklaters and Sanjay's influence on 
India) to maintain the ""honest broker"" role.  If Frank Sayre ends up staying 
with Global Assets to help with Central America, he may want the same 
reporting structure.

Second, Rebecca and Jim are going to expect me to have an ability to 
direct/influence legal activities in Global Assets -- they already have 
concerns about their own ability to direct commercial activities (given the 
lingering influence of former regional business heads) and are not going to 
want to compound these difficulties with legal reporting problems.  I'm a 
little concerned about the responsiveness of lawyers in South America to me 
if I'm completely outside their reporting structure.  That being said, I 
think that we can probably work this issue out with Randy.

I look forward to our conversation on Monday.

1511,"Hello, Everyone -

This Notice postpones our tentatively scheduled  RTO West Regional 
Representatives Group Meeting from April 20 to May 4.? As  most of you know, 
substantial work is on-going in the areas of congestion  management and 
contract conversion.? With respect to congestion management,  the RTO West 
filing utilities are working together with other stakeholders to  consider 
refinements to the Stage 1 congestion model.? There is an  additional effort 
among the filing utilities to develop a possible alternative  to the Stage 1 
model.? These efforts will be among the topics at the May 4  meeting.? When 
we get closer to the meeting date, I'll send a notice on  specific time and 
location.

At our March 23 RRG meeting, I briefed  everyone on my discussions with a 
FERC staff member on the status of the RTO  West October 23 filing.? I was 
told that the FERC Commissioners wanted to  hold a meeting in the West to get 
the views of western states' representatives  on RTOs (and critical pricing, 
grid enhancements, generation, and other  infrastructure issues) before they 
took up the RTO West filing.? In its  Order issued March 16, Docket No. 
PL01-3-000, entitled ""Removing Obstacles to  Increased Electric Generation 
and Natural Gas Supply in the Western United  States,""? FERC stated that it 
saw a west wide RTO, or a seamless  integration of Western RTOs, as ""the best 
vehicle for designing and implementing  a long-term regional solution.""

This past Tuesday, April 10, FERC hosted  a meeting in Boise to get the views 
of western states' representatives on  western electric price volatility, a 
western regional transmission organization,  and generation and transmission 
infrastructure.? During the time allotted  to RTOs, the states' 
representatives unanimously opposed moving immediately to a  west wide RTO 
and supported moving forward with the regional RTO initiatives  (RTO West and 
DSTAR) that are currently before FERC. This position on RTOs was  essentially 
uniform among all of the states' representatives attending.? In  addition, 
the states' representatives strongly encouraged the FERC to move  forward 
quickly and get orders out on the current RTO filings.? State PUC  
Commissioners Roger Hamilton (Oregon), Marsha Smith (Idaho), and Marilyn  
Showalter (Washington) were particularly forceful and eloquent in opposing a  
west wide RTO and supporting moving forward with the regional  proposals.

My hope is that FERC heard the message from the states'  representatives and 
will act on the compliance filings very soon.? The next  opportunity for RTO 
West to be on? FERC's agenda is April 25.? We  should know by April 18 
whether RTO West is on the agenda.? If it is, then  an Order could issue from 
FERC on April 25 or 26, and this will give all of us  about a week to review 
and digest it before the RRG meets on May  4.

During this time of uncertainty and crisis in the western energy  markets, 
your continued support for RTO West is very much appreciated. 

Thanks very much.

EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous 
aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP) 
and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in 
APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically 
insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of 
generators in the following provisions:

 -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order 
to seek interconnection
 -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot
 -- Specific milestones must be added
 -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA
 -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load 
 -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study
 -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a 
generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal)
 -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm
 -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to 
satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator 
of      information that affects the generator
 -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety

FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all 
pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation.

Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and 
CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to 
pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may 
incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in 
VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC.  
((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest.  
FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some 
confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing 
customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.))

Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides 
that ""Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long 
as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by 
Transmission Provider up to that point.""  FPL's unfiled procedures allow 
withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers 
includes similar procedures.  

What are ""material changes"" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's 
provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2) 
in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the 
move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions 
(unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more 
than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3) 
change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the 
length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however, 
that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can 
result in loss of queue spot.  

Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&L 
will provide workpapers used in the studies on request.",VEPCO,,FERC EPMI DENA Arizona Public Service's IA APS CP&L EPMI/Duke Transmission Provider FPL Consumer's IAs

Dissension at FERC:=20
Commission Divided On Price Caps, Future Leadership

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from Reuters, March 20] The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
(FERC) said it remained divided on whether it should impose a temporary cap=
=20
on wholesale prices in the western United States to prevent summer blackout=
s=20
and price spikes. The three FERC commissioners, who regulate interstate=20
electricity markets, testified at a House of Representatives Energy and Air=
=20
Quality subcommittee hearing as California braced for another day of=20
blackouts.=20

Analysis: Since the start of deregulation in the early 1990s, FERC's variou=
s=20
positions on how competition should unfold across the country have been=20
fairly consistent. Despite its changing members, as a whole the five-member=
=20
commission (with two positions currently open) has taken a ""hands-off""=20
approach to its regulatory role, preferring instead to allow free market=20
forces to drive competition in the energy industry. In fact, Curt H,bert,=
=20
appointed as FERC chairman in January by President Bush, told me in an=20
interview during his tenure as a commissioner that he envisioned a time whe=
n=20
FERC would step out of its regulatory role altogether. However, significant=
=20
structural and philosophical changes within the FERC have surfaced since=20
January, dovetailing with the departure of former chairman James Hoecker. A=
s=20
the federal regulatory body for the energy industry, FERC has the=20
responsibility for setting price caps in all regions across the country. Th=
e=20
debate over whether or not to take this controversial step seems to have=20
exposed some inherent dissension within FERC at the very time when the futu=
re=20
leadership of the commission has been cast in doubt. =20

At the House of Representatives meeting on March 20, H,bert, a Republican,=
=20
reiterated his objections to price caps. Chairman H,bert has maintained his=
=20
long-standing opinion that wholesale price caps have done and can do=20
""long-term damage."" In January, H,bert told me, ""I have seen no evidence th=
at=20
price caps will have any positive impact in creating a balanced market.""=20
Although still generally opposed to wholesale price caps on a federal or=20
regional level, H,bert is willing to consider them as one possibility among=
=20
other short-term resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California.=
=20
Reuters reported that H,bert said at the hearings that ""such controls are n=
ot=20
a long-term solution and would discourage the industry from building more=
=20
power plants to supply the West."" Rather, H,bert believes that power=20
generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants, both in=
=20
California and elsewhere. H,bert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as=
=20
saying, ""Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand, thus=20
correcting the current imbalance. Capping prices through regulation or=20
legislation will have exactly the opposite effect.""=20

Despite H,bert's opposition to wholesale price caps, fellow Commissioner=20
William Massey, a Democrat, asserted that California and the western region=
=20
were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary ""time out"" or price cap=
=20
was needed to let the market stabilize. ""The commission must act forcefully=
=20
and decisively to reassure market participants, policymakers and consumers=
=20
that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and ju=
st=20
and reasonable rates,"" Massey said. In addition, Massey reportedly also sai=
d=20
that ""such a price cap could be calculated on a generator-by-generator basi=
s=20
at each generator's variable operating cost, plus a reasonable capacity=20
adder, perhaps in the range of $25 per megawatt hour."" Massey reiterated th=
e=20
severity of the crisis in California, noting that whereas wholesale power i=
n=20
the state cost $7 billion in 1999 it increased to $27 billion in 2000 and=
=20
could exceed $70 billion for 2001. =20

Rounding out the commission's divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key=20
Breathitt, a Democrat, who said that all possible options should be analyze=
d=20
and debated. Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for pric=
e=20
controls.=20

Chairman H,bert's stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary=20
Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration. In fact,=20
Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will ""discourage investmen=
t=20
in new generation at a time when it is most needed"" and drive power produce=
rs=20
to other regions of the country (and further away from California). The=20
Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price=
=20
caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California. ""The=
=20
only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price=
=20
caps,"" Abraham said. =20

Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearin=
g=20
is scheduled for later this week. Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, a Texas=
=20
Republican, noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether o=
r=20
not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the=
=20
next few weeks. =20

This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FE=
RC=20
over major issues facing the energy industry. The commission also became=20
divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission=
=20
organizations (RTOs). FERC's December 1999 vote on the Alliance RTO=20
illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies=
=20
that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be=20
regulated. Then-Commissioner H,bert was of the opinion that the Alliance RT=
O=20
met FERC guidelines for RTO formation, and was the sole member who=20
successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an=
=20
RTO. However, H,bert stood as a minority. The other three commissioners at=
=20
FERC at the time (Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt) preferred to wield a tight=
er=20
regulatory hand and monitor how transmission owners comply with current=20
transmission policy. While H,bert supports the ownership of RTOs by utiliti=
es=20
and letting free market principles rule, the other commissioners at FERC=20
appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities.=20

Meanwhile, speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat=
=20
Wood III, chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), to the=
=20
position of FERC chairman. H,bert was named chairman in February by Preside=
nt=20
Bush after James Hoecker resigned shortly before the new Republican=20
administration took office Jan. 20. At that time, the president did not=20
indicate that H,bert's appointment as chair was temporary. Wood was appoint=
ed=20
by then Texas Governor Bush to the PUCT in 1995 and played a primary role i=
n=20
the development of that state's restructuring plan. (Electric choice begins=
=20
in Texas on June 1, 2001, with the start of a pilot program and then the=20
market opens fully to competition on Jan. 1, 2002). =20

The possible shift in leadership at FERC appears to be politically motivate=
d.=20
There are two ""Republican"" openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush.=
=20
As noted, presently H,bert is the only Republican among the current three=
=20
members. Wood, reportedly a close ally and advisor to the former Texas=20
governor, has been repeatedly named as a strong candidate for one of the=20
Republican openings on FERC for some time. However, the Washington Post and=
=20
Reuters have reported that Wood will be appointed as FERC chairman, forcing=
=20
H,bert to step back into a role as commissioner. The report in Reuters=20
indicated that H,bert, a friend and prot,g, of Senate Majority Leader Trent=
=20
Lott (R-Miss.), is personally ""fighting the planned move."" The nomination=
=20
would require Senate confirmation.=20

Moreover, as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC, th=
e=20
issue of price caps remains unresolved. The debate over price caps also has=
=20
divided others involved, strictly along party lines. Generally speaking,=20
Democrats believe that the federal government should step in to prevent wha=
t=20
has been called ""price gouging"" on the part of  energy companies. Republica=
ns=20
believe that the government (including FERC and the Bush administration)=20
should maintain a ""hands-off"" approach and allow the marketplace to determi=
ne=20
prices. Speaking from a non-partisan point of view, some economists now=20
question whether=01*and not just how=01*deregulation of electricity markets=
 should=20
occur at all. For instance, Alfred E. Kahn, the Cornell University economis=
t=20
who helped deregulate other industries, says that electricity markets may n=
ot=20
lend themselves to full competition and that there may be a value in=20
retaining vertical integration among utilities (allowing a single regulated=
=20
power company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity). The movemen=
t=20
toward re-regulation certainly throws an additional wrinkle into the debate=
=20
over wholesale price caps. =20

Yet, in any event, once again California remains the catalyst for=20
decision-making on this issue. As rolling blackouts threaten to continue in=
to=20
a third day in the state, federal lawmakers may be pressured to issue a=20
definitive position on wholesale price caps for California, which of course=
=20
would set a precedent for the rest of the country. As the industry's top=20
agency in charge of wholesale markets, FERC's ultimate position on price ca=
ps=20
carries tremendous influence. Despite the apparent dissension within the=20
commission and possible changes in its leadership, FERC is presently=20
challenged to formulate a solid policy on how wholesale transactions will b=
e=20
conducted, or once and for all absolve itself from jurisdiction in this=20
area. =20

1532,"I would like to keep you informed on the issue of small generation 
interconnection to the BPA transmission network. I am trying to find sites to 
locate some mobile generators that Enron has available. There are several 
Public Power utilities (BPA customers)  in the Region that are interested in 
having these units located in their service areas. My understanding is that 
BPA is requiring small generators to go through an interconnect process if 
they want to sell the power on the market. But, if the utility owns the 
generation, or if the utilities industrial customer owns it, and they are 
displacing BPA power then they don't have to go through this interconnection 
process.  That seems to me like self-dealing in that BPA's Power Business 
Line gets the benefit of this load that the Transmission Business Line is

Ron and I discussed this some more and decided that we should file re

1560,"I believe there is a potential ""anti-trust"" issue brewing at BPA. I know BPA 
is subject to different rules than most other entities, however, I have 
sought to understand how they are acquiring power from customers, or allowing 
some customers to install small scale generation and BPA buys that power, 
without it hitting the federal transmission system. 

It may not be an issue in as much as Enron, or other marketing entities, may 
not want to compete with BPA to purchase power from these small generation 
units. 

However, if we were interested in buying this energy that's too bad because 
we can't get access to it.

BPA's Power Business Line (PBL) is making arrangements with local utilities 
and with those utilities industrial customers through which the customer 
installs small generation units and the PBL is purchasing the output. In this 
instance the customers load is not reduced. BPA is concerned that if the 
customer reduces load they (BPA) will lose revenue, as will the host utility 
(distribution costs). So the concept is that the generator simply continue to 
buy ""priority firm"" energy through the host utility and they sell the output 
of the small generator to BPA. But, because it takes so long to get through 
BPA's Transmission Business Line's (TBL's) interconnection and system study 
process, the PBL is simply going around that process. This treats the output 
as though it is going to BPA's grid without reducing the host utilities load. 
However, the PBL is not seeking to ""interconnect"" these loads with the 
federal grid because it takes too long to do that. 

If Enron wants to buy power from a small generator, either Enron or the host 
utility or the industrial customer will have to go through BPA's extensive 
analysis process.  In one instance I am aware of, the industrial customer 
would like to get a market price for the output of their generator but BPA is 
telling them they will only pay a price much lower than market ($90-110 MWhr) 
for the next year. The generator feels they are held hostage to BPA's offer 
because they are not able to get onto the federal transmission network.

Seems like anti-trust to me. Or, at a minimum, self-dealing which I believe 
FERC has sought to avoid.

March 12th.  Eric previously worked as a  financial advisor at Paine Webber.
Please join me in welcoming Eric to the West Desk.

B. Williams",Eric Linder Eric Paine Webber B. Williams,,
1562,"Are you putting words in my mouth Tim.  

The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy markets 
with a ""real supply curve"" and a ""real demand curve"" such that hourly 
clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity.   With 
respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is 
necessary, that is subject to much debate.   Although I prefer a zonal model 
for simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in 
the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time 
energy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricing 
is necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created in 
zones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.

Our views, I believe, are still very much aligned, however, I need to make 
some progress on the creation of real time energy markets.   The zonal 
markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a 
mis-priced commodity with no ""real"" price signal sent to the market.   Out of 
merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion 
is managed through energy uplift payments (congestion price signal is not 
sent to the market).   This results in a very inefficient commodity market 
where the consumer gets screwed and market makers can't price the commodity 
or transportation on a forward basis.

I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding.",Tim,,LMP NEPOOL ERCOT

DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.

I had a meeting with Dan Pribble and Barney Brasher this morning reviewing the current status of the TW Operation forecast.  It appears, at this point in time, that we have been able to clear up and cover all the unplanned expenditures, except for a remaining stretch of approximately $1,000,000.   We are working with all entities within ETS Operations on NNG and TW to find ways and means to cover this remaining stretch between the two companies (TW) and (NNG) during the month of December.

Since late October, Barney and his team have uncovered expenses on TW in the amount of approximately $3 million that was not covered in the Fourth Quarter forecast.   We have cleaned up all but the remaining $1 million.

Dan and Barney have both held meetings face to face with the parties involved in forecasting, or lack of it, and are implementing corrective actions.

We really appreciate the massive effort all personnel are taking to help alleviate this situation and we within OSS have implemented tighter controls and reviews on all the Business Units.   We will initiate weekly flash reviews and monitor closely the processing of all expense invoices during the month of December.

   1. A subversive group or device placed within enemy ranks.

   2. The hollow wooden horse in which, according to legend, Greeks hid
      and gained entrance to Troy, later opening the gates to their army.

   3. A set of instructions hidden inside a legitimate program, causing
      a computer to perform illegitimate functions.

[From Troy, a ancient city of northwest Asia Minor near the Dardanelles.]

   ""Some upholders of academic tradition argue that the universities
   have been too ready to allow a Trojan horse inside the walls of
   learning.""
   Science has enriched the university, The Economist, 4 Oct 1997.

1628,"Well our first week in our new office has been quite an experience.  Armin
is only in the office late at night, so I am up here on this hill all alone
during the day, just me and Angus.  On Monday a man came from some
department of the government to ""control"" the office... he wanted to check
that we have everything required by law for our employees.  Since only the
office is finished he kindly said he would come back in the fall, he was
very nice.

On Tuesday another man came from the government, once again to ""control"" the
employees, same kind of stuff as the 1st man, just another branch of the
government.  Since only the office is finished he kindly said he would come
back in the fall, he was very nice too.  Both of these men showed me ID,
even though it meant nothing to me.

Then on Wednesday, there was loud knocking on the office door and I walked
down the stairs to see about 15 MEN CONVERGING ON MY WHOLE BUILDING!  They
were all dressed in plain clothes, jeans and stuff, and had arrived in
several dark colored cars and a white van.  I opened the door and some of
them came in.  The one in charge spoke to me but I only  understood the
words customs and control the employees!  They were looking everywhere and
looking at me quite strangely.  I was very uncomfortable not know WHO OR
WHAT they were.  When the leader realized that I spoke better English than
German, he spoke to the others..""ENGLISH!"" and then another one came from
the rear and began questioning me in English.  He wanted to know where the
employees were, if I was alone, what I was doing...he then realized that
there was a business working out this building and asked if it was mine, I
QUICKLY said NO, IT'S MY HUSBANDS!  He then wanted all the details about our
buisness, what we did, how many employees etc.  I was so puzzeled and he
could see it.  They all started smiling at each other then just said, this
IS your address for the buisiness, Schleehofstr. 14?  I said yes and he said
OK, fine.  Then, they all packed up and left.

I didn't see or talk to Armin until he came home for lunch.  I explained to
him what had happened and he was shocked too.  He said that's never happened
to his business before.  Then the more we talked about it, it began to
become clear what they had really been there to do and why.  Our building
looks and is still very much under construction, even though no one but me
is working here right now.  But the company that built the structure still
has their mobile office here and their workers meet here each morning before
going in company trucks to their new jobsite, leaving their autos out front
on the street.  The men had been with the german immigration police.
Someone must have called in that there were illegal aliens working at this
address!  When they arrived they saw all the cars and came in to carry off
any illegals in there van that were working on the jobsite, they really had
no interest in our buisiness or employees!  So yes, I got raided on my 3rd
day here in our new office.  Armin said that they should have shown me some
ID and never open the door again unless I see ID...LIKE GERMAN ID IS GOING
TO MEAN ALOT TO ME THRU A GLASS DOOR?!?!?  What an experience.

So how's things going with you?  I got the aol thing and will try to get
that set up.  But mostly when you are online at your house, I'm asleep.
Write when you can!

> DIAGNOSIS: AIDS THEN AND NOW



While scientists concede they may be far from a cure, today's AIDS drugs ""are
nothing short of miraculous,"" says Dr. Jim Curran, head of the first government
task force on what was later called AIDS. Diagnosis of AIDS in the 1980s was

workers have finished installing our toilet flushing system?? We have 6
toilets and they have been set up where they can be flushed with water from
our rainwater cistern (it holds like 30,000 gallons).  cool huh, water is so
expensive here and rain is free!  Armin is talking with the customers about
doing it, but they are thinking they want to wash their clothes with it
too...i don't think that's such a good idea, the water is not purified...but
the washingmachine does heat itself, it doesn't use a hot water heater...so
I ""guess"" it could be ok...

Love ya'll

Coco

Sally was only eight years old when she heard Mommy and Daddy talking about
her little brother, Georgi. He was very sick and they had done everything
they could afford to save his life. Only a very expensive surgery could help
him now and that was out of the financial question. She heard Daddy say it
with a whispered desperation, ""Only a miracle can save him now.""

Sally went to her bedroom and pulled her piggy bank from its hiding
place in the closet. She shook all the change out on the floor and
counted it carefully. Three times. The total had to be exactly
perfect. No chance here for mistakes. Tying the coins up in a kerchief, she
slipped out of the apartment and made her way to the corner drug store.

She waited patiently for the pharmacist to give her attention but he was too
busy talking to another man to be bothered by an eight year old.Sally
twisted her feet to make a scuffing noise. She cleared her throat. No
good.Finally she took a quarter from its hiding place and banged it on the
glass counter. That did it!

""And what do you want?"" the pharmacist asked in an annoyed tone of voice.
""I'm talking to my brother.""

""Well, I want to talk to you about my brother,"" Sally answered back in the
same annoyed tone. ""He's sick ... and I want to buy a miracle."" ""I beg your
pardon,"" said the pharmacist. ""My Daddy says only a miracle  can save him
now. So how much does a miracle cost?""

""We don't sell miracles here, little girl. I can't help you.""

""Listen, I have the money to pay for it. Just tell me how much it
costs.""

The well dressed man stooped down and asked, ""What kind of a miracle does
your brother need?"" ""I don't know,"" Sally answered. A tear  started down her
cheek. ""I just know he's really sick and Mommy says he needs an operation.
But my folks can't pay for it, so I have my money.

""How much do you have?"" asked the well dressed man. ""A dollar and eleven
cents,"" Sally answered proudly. ""And it's all the money I have in the
world.""

""Well, what a coincidence,"" smiled the man. ""A dollar and eleven cents--the
exact price of a miracle to save a little brother. ""He took her money in one
hand and with the other hand he grasped her mitten and said ""Take me to
where you live. I want to see your brother and meet your parents.""

That well dressed man was Dr. Carlton Armstrong, renowned surgeon,
specializing in solving Georgi's malady. The operation was completed without
charge and it wasn't long until Georgi was home again and doing well. Mommy
and Daddy were happily talking about the chain of events that had led them
to this place. ""That surgery,"" Mommy whispered. ""It's like a miracle. I
wonder how much it would have cost?""

Sally smiled to herself. She knew exactly how much a miracle
cost...one dollar and eleven cents ... plus the faith of a little child.

1649,"Subject:  Pancakes

Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents
pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter,
opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it
on  the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands,
mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail
on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  Brandon was
covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something
very good for his Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't  know
what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove, (and
he didn't know how the stove worked)!

Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and  reached to
push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried
to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his
pajamas white and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.
Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was
something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was
coming, maybe even a spanking.

But his father just watched him. Then, walking through the mess, he picked
up his crying son, hugged him, and loved him, getting his own pajamas white
and sticky in the process.

That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it
turns into a mess sometimes. Our marriage gets all sticky, or we insult a
friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we
just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.

That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some
of our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't
stop trying to ""make pancakes,"" for God or for others.

Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...


Please pass some of this love on to others.

I plan to participate on tomorrow's conference call on your behalf. 

I met with Rae earlier today and had a quick preview of this document.  The 
crux of the recommendation is that Rae would like to take a procedural vote 
at the March 2 Board meeting on whether the Board intends to move forward 
with pursuing retail standards.

If the procedural vote is ""yes,"" then she is proposing to have Jay Costan and 
Bill Boswell start drafting the governance documents.  I mentioned that I 
would like to participate in reviewing the Bylaws and Certificate as your 
representative.

I think that the attached backround and Feb. 14 meeting summary is fine.  I 
have lots of thoughts on the possible organizational structure document -- 
but these are probably best saved until the Board votes on its intentions.  
I'd say the procedural vote is too close to call at this point.   Rae reports 
that Warren Mitchell of SoCal Gas, Reliant, End-Users and a number of state 
commissioners are firmly behind moving forward.

1670,"Attached is a spreadsheet that compares our original plan (budget plus
overview) to our forecast for the 2nd quarter with actuals for April and May
and last months forecast for June.  We are in the process of completing our
May closing but the IBIT number for May is 99% complete.  The June forecast
was prepared last month and we are now in the process of updating our forecast
of power cost and IBIT for June.  We should complete that next week.   Curves
in the west continue to come down which will potentially reduce our IBIT for
June, but I will know more next week.  

The spreadsheet shows 70.1 million IBIT compared to what I provided you early
this week of 65 million.  The primary difference is power cost and our view
that given the current movement in wholesale prices from May 8 that power cost
could rise by an additional 5 million from that level.  We are currently in
the dead band zone for the PCA so any change in power cost go right to IBIT.  
There is one other issue related to power cost concerning our need to
potentially increase our reserves for the California receivables.  AA
continues to push us on this issue to increase the amount of reserves.  If we
have a good June we might want to increase our reserves, however this is
something we will talk with Bob Butz about early next month when June results
are available.

Please call if you would like to discuss this further.  We will have a better
look at June next week once the updated forecast is completed.",Bob Butz,,IBIT PCA

Central America/DR:

Guatemala:  MARAD will reply this week as to their position vis-a-vis the r=
eduction of Enron's contingent support from $28 to $10 million.  It is poss=
ible they will ask for additional information. =20
=20
Nicaragua:  Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6=
.3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to swee=
p the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped b=
y the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project).  Partners to re=
imburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron's ultimate outflow will=
 be approximately $2.2 million.  Team tried to get MARAD to agree to altern=
ative solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and pol=
itical implications.
=20
Panama:  Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elekt=
ra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama).  Three issues are wor=
th noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) wi=
ll likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can't get bid bonds on its o=
wn although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM's mar=
ginal costs are among highest in Panama.  A preliminary strategy has been m=
apped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit ""one-sided"" in favor of the distri=
butor.  BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the =
distco to change terms without success. =20
=20
Dominican Republic:  El Paso confirmed it can't work with us.  Operationall=
y, the plant is working well.  As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI's fuel su=
pplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.=
  Enron rejected the request.  SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol.  We =

 Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they underst=
and that Mirant's insurance package is the result of market conditions.  Le=

that we have in place the required permits, ROW, and all permanent material

Also, we will be asking FERC for clarification, or in the alternative for

1.  FERC misunderstood a request by FDEP that construction across water

morning.  Let me know if you have any trouble getting your copy.  Michael 
Ratner is now building a baseline economic model for each of the four (4) 
assets using data presented in the information memoranda.  Once the model 
works, we will be able to modify the data to run various cases for various 
asset combinations.  We need to identify all synergies and any other areas of 
special consideration that could impact our valuation (i.e. does ownership of 
Minnegasco provide any strategic opportunities, any value in the AC line 
access to northeast pipelines, etc.)  

You should soon receive another smaller packet from Merrill Lynch describing 
two different deal structures for our consideration - one is a ""prepaid 
lease"" arrangement, the other a ""leveraged partnership"". 

I am trying to set up a meeting with Robert Eichenroht to discuss PUHCA 
issues and how this deal would be impacted if we were to include either the 
Arkla LDC or Minnegasco package. 

Non-binding EOI's are due next Wednesday and time is short.  Bill Cordes will

must respond with a non-binding indication of interest by 5:00 PM, March 15.  
If we are selected to go on to the next phase of the process, we will be 
scheduled for a 2 day data room visit.  These sessions will begin on or about 
March 20.  It is a fairly fast track deal.  REI wants binding offers by April 
20, with final execution of a definitive agreement in late April/early May.

The assets are being offered either as a total package, or in any subset(s), 
broken down as follows:
 Reliant Energy Gas Transmission and Mississippi River Transmission  (to be 
viewed together as a single asset)
 Reliant Energy Field Services (gathering and processing)
 Reliant Energy Arkla (LDC)
 Reliant Energy Minnegasco (LDC)

We will need to find a solution to the PUHCA problem if we seriously want to 
buy either the Minnegasco or Arkla LDC assets (this could be very 
difficult).  The transmission and the field service assets would be ""easier"" 
to own from that standpoint.  In any event, we may want to go to all the data 
rooms just to learn about these assets.

Bottom line, if our preliminary bids are good enough to get into the data 
room phase of this deal, we will need a lot of help from the operations 
side.  These assets start with field gathering & processing, and end with 
retail gas deliveries to the homeowner ... truly a ""stem to stern"" asset 
package.  I'll keep you up to date on our progress, but we should be thinking 
about the team we'd put in the data room, and on site visits, etc. if given

Please note Les' latest summary of Elba.  Things seem to be coming to a head 
there.  Southern Co. was in town last Thursday to visit us and Les agreed to 
start working on a letter of intent with Southern Co for the sale of gas from 
the terminal.   We have been asked to work up a good price for gas at Elba by 
Les.  I have started working with John Hodge and John Griffith on this.

So. Co.'s latest offer was Hub + $.12 for all 160,000 dt/d.  So. Co. wants 
100,000 dt/d at Elba and will give us the option of selling to them the 
remaining 60,000 dt/d at Elba or Destin at our option.  We have not discussed 
what a price at Destin should be.  So. Co. has some leverage with El Paso 
that can be instrumental in helping Les with his negotiations below.  
Additionally, they may be the only party that can burn the high btu gas and 
significantly improve the btu issue at Elba.

We should be better prepared to talk about this by Wednesday.  Let me know if 
you have any questions.

In accordance with our discussion, attached you will find a blacklined and

incorporate those of the changes we discussed.  The only item that I changed

between the parties that the waiver is effective.

If these changes meet with your approval, please have the agreement reviewed

even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be 
enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be 
enforced in court?

2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process 
agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or 
maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct

Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted 
into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master 
database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft 
form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to 
manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the 
Australian agreements plugged into the system.

This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of 
contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take 
a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with 
and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a 
global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take 
on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if 
someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and 
asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in 
another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the 
same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort 
on the counterparty front.

In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no 
way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.

Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside 
auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.

For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master 
agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. 
Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract 
records and approval for online trading.

For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our 
Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside 
legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the 
confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The 
database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have 
found helpful.

You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator 
requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you 
get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can 
figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..

Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good 
time for me to do a full review of this database with you.  ",David Mark Taylor Mike Neves,,"Legal and Credit the

1818,"A seemingly unresolved issue is our right to prepay before the end of the 
term of the swaps.  I believe this is something we want commercially, but 
what is not clear to me is how we envision this working commercially.  In 
other words, although any swap can be bought out, I do not believe the ISDA 
documentation contemplates agreed terms for buy-out.  Rather, the party 
seeking to get out early asks for the counterparty's offer and hits the offer 
or not.  If RBC or Swapco was not willing to make an we are willing to 
transact at, we might not be able to get out.  Perhaps Sara could advise if 
my interpretation of the ISDA is right and, if so, Brian and Soma can confirm 
how they see prepayment working without a specified prepayment right.

TO:
COMEX Division Floor Community

FROM: Michael Campanelli, Vice President, Floor Operations, COMEX Division

RE:
New Trading Card Recordation Procedures Related to the Implementation of th=
e=20
Trade Management System (TMS) on COMEX

For trading card images mentioned as examples in the text below, please ref=
er=20
to:
http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/ntm_353.htm

Introduction
As you are aware, in the near future, the Exchange plans to merge the two=
=20
divisions onto one trade processing platform.  The COMEX Division will=20
replace its On-Line Trade Entry (OLTE) system with the NYMEX Trade Manageme=
nt=20
System (TMS).

While final details are being determined; certain procedural aspects of the=
=20
transition process can begin. Therefore, effective immediately, the followi=
ng=20
should be considered:



Single Sided Concept
The source document for TMS will be the trading card.  Floor staff will=20
collect the original white copies and forward them to the Exchange Trade Da=
ta=20
Entry area where operators will key the sell side trades.  The trading card=
s=20
will no longer be forwarded to the Primary Clearing Members (PCM=01,s); ins=
tead=20
they will be retained by the Exchange (THIS WILL BEGIN WITH TMS=20
IMPLEMENTATION ON COMEX).  Each sell side will generate a buy side.  The=20
broker=01,s staff will be responsible for Account Assignment, Trade Checkou=
t and=20
Corrections (in addition, for buy side trades it will be necessary to add t=
he=20
execution time).



Implementation
In accordance with the implementation of TMS, members must begin to use new=
=20
trading card recordation procedures developed to facilitate data input.



Implementation Schedule
The COMEX Division will implement TMS for ALL COMMODITIES in the near futur=
e.
WE ASK THAT ALL MEMBERS BEGIN USING THESE RECORDATION PROCEDURES IMMEDIATEL=
Y,=20
to ensure readiness when TMS implementation takes place.

This will allow members to familiarize themselves with the new recordation=
=20
procedures and enable the Exchange=01,s Trade Processing staff to review th=
e=20
handwriting/recordation techniques of the COMEX Division=01,s membership pr=
ior=20
to launch.  During this interim period, if necessary staff will contact=20
members regarding their handwriting or lack of adherence to procedures.  In=
=20
addition, staff will begin to familiarize members=01, clerks with TMS=20
functionality.



Spread Processing
TMS will process all the legs of a spread as one transaction.  To accomplis=
h=20
this it is essential for the broker to clearly designate seller status on t=
he=20
trading card when he/she is the seller of the spread (see recordation=20
procedures noted below). This indication will inform data entry personnel t=
o=20
enter the entire spread (buy and sell components).  Opposite buy spreads (n=
ot=20
keyed by the Exchange) that are linked to a seller status will be generated=
=20
by the system.


NOTE: When submitting cards for data entry, the differential must be=20
indicated or it will be rejected.  If the differential is noted without=20
prices for either leg, the system will assign the appropriate market pricin=
g=20
to both legs based on the most recent price reports.  If the differential i=
s=20
noted along with the price of one of the legs, the system will assign an=20
appropriate price to the other leg.



Recordation Procedures
For the purpose of standardization within the community, the following=20
trading card recordation procedures must be used by the brokers:

ALPHA CODES ONLY
*TMS does not recognize numeric broker codes, therefore use only the=20
appropriate alpha broker codes for trading card recordation and trade=20
processing.

SPREADS (MULTIPLE LEG TRADES)
*Place the value of the spread (differential) in the bottom portion of each=
=20
entry line=01,s center field.  Circle the spread value. This will inform da=
ta=20
entry personnel that the trade is a spread (see e.g. 1).

NOTE: Failure to place a circled differential in the spread box will result=
=20
in the entry of the sell leg only as an outright trade.

*Place a slash through the circled differential if you are the buyer of the=
=20
spread.  This will inform data entry personnel to ignore the spread (see e.=
g.=20
2).

*Attach a line to either of the above mentioned indicators when a multiple=
=20
leg spread is involved; for example:  Butterflies; this will convey that al=
l=20
the components are part of one entity (see e.g. 3).

CABINET TRADES
*Place ""CAB"" or ""C"" in the premium column (see e.g. 4).

CONVERSIONS
*Place the option components on one line.  The futures component price must=
=20
be written on the next line, across the Strike and Premium columns (see e.g=
.=20
5).

MATCHED ORDERS
*Place ""MO"" in the price column (see e.g. 6).

Trades submitted to the Exchange as MO transactions will initially receive=
=20
the previous day=01,s settlement prices until the current day=01,s settleme=
nt=20
prices are determined and immediately applied.

EXCHANGE FOR PHYSICAL ""EFP=01,S""
*Place ""EFP"" or ""E"" in the (SPD) box (bottom portion of each entry lines=20
center field) (see e.g. 7).

Crossing of Orders
Place a ""Y"" in the spread (SPD) box (see e.g. 8 line A), except when crossi=
ng=20
an EFP, at which time the letters ""EFP"" must be indicated instead.  (see e.=
g.=20
8 line B).  Additionally, it will not be necessary to denote a ""Y"" for cros=
s=20
trades that require the recordation of a differential.

Note:  The clearing information related to a short code that is data entere=
d=20
by the Exchange will only apply to the sell portion of the cross trade.  Th=
e=20
buy side will require subsequent allocation in a typical manner.

Strip Trades
Place the beginning and ending months in the month columns of successive=20
trade lines, with the average price indicated in the price column.  Write=
=20
*STRIP* adjacent to the bracketed trade data to highlight the trade type fo=
r=20
data entry personnel. (see e.g. 9).

Note: The reccommended recordation procedures for various additional types =
of=20
trades are shown in examples 10 through 20.

Short Codes
When it is possible the account area on the card should be used to indicate=
=20
the appropriate short code.  The Exchange will data enter the sellers short=
=20
code and the corresponding account assignment information will be generated=
.

Note: When a short code is provided as part of spread sellers sell leg=20
information, the allocation will be applied to both the sell leg and the bu=
y=20
leg.  If the buy is intended for the same customer but a different clearing=
=20
member, a reallocation will be necessary.



Trading Months
1st occurrence - month symbol
2nd occurrence - circled month symbol
Beyond 2nd occurrence - month symbol plus the last digit of the appropriate=
=20
year.

Trading Card Submission Requirements
Cards must be submitted within 15 minutes of the time of execution of the=
=20
first trade (buy or sell) recorded on the card.  For example a trade execut=
ed=20
at 10:15 a.m. must be submitted no later than 10:30 a.m. Submission=20
performance will be monitored by the Exchange and those brokers deemed=20
non-diligent will be subject to disciplinary action.

Note: Cards that include trades executed during either the close or=20
post-close, must be submitted within 5 minutes of the bell marking the end =
of=20
each period.

Trading Ring Change Submission Procedure
Cards must be submitted to the ring in which the trades appearing on them=
=20
were executed.  Therefore, in cases when a broker intends to leave one ring=
=20
to trade in another, prior to leaving if he/she has a partially completed=
=20
card it must be submitted in the ring he/she is departing.



Trading in a Multiple Commodity Ring
Trades that are recorded on a trading card that differ from the commodity=
=20
indicated on the heading of the card, should include the commodity name, fo=
r=20
example: ALUMINUM, written adjacent to the trade details on the same entry=
=20
line (see e.g. 21).

Audit Trail Timing
Every trade whether buy or sell, must have an accurate trade time.  There i=
s=20
no change to the audit trail timing methodology.  Just as is current=20
practice, the execution times indicated by the broker on his/her trading=20
cards will continue to be compared to the Exchange Times and Sales as well =
as=20
the opposite broker=01,s execution times.

Questions?????? If you have questions regarding the new trading card=20
procedures please call Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David Sherma=
n=20
at (212) 299-2061.

looking forward to the cooler weather.  I got some good bargains on post 
winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about 
buying a sweater!  I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one 
sitting!

My backyard is really looking good.  It's almost all planted, maybe 90% 
done.  I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer 
Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).  It will be a 
while before they look like trees, though.  Right now they kinda look like 
tall bushes.  I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft. 
plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little 
little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about 
7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.  They're in pots, because I'll have 
to take them in during hard freezed.  I've planted lots of climbing pink, 
yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.  It will take a while before 
they fill out.  Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot 
of color.  Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over 
Houston.   I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds 
and butterflies.  I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a 
bit.  Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit.  
I need a little sun to make them bloom.  And then there's my St. Francis 
fountain.  He's just lovely!

Also, the central air is done.  No more noise from window units.  Now he's 
painting my bedrooms, the front one a real pale blue, and the back one a real 
pale pink.  I hope when I get back from Europe it will all be over and I can 
start cleaning up all the dust.  I'll have 3 days to recuperate because of 
the 4th of July holiday.

You and Sue were going to spruce up your garden a bit.  Have you been able to 
do anything?  I'm so glad I got to see your house.  Now when you talk about 
things I can picture what you're talking about.

Also, when I get back from Europe I'm going to get some cats again.  I'm 
looking forward to that.  I think I'm finally over mourning the demise of 
poor Willow.

Mark said he didn't have a lot of time to visit with you when he was there 
because you were in Teeside a lot of the time.  I'm sorry he didn't get a 
chance to see your car.  I was trying to describe it to him and I don't think 
I gave it justice.

NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to
court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World
Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press
conference earlier today.  They were joined by members of the Major League
Players Union. ""We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,""
said the Mets batting coach.  ""We were confused by the irregularities of the
pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit.""

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the
press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of
the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the
Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. ""The fact remains that
some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit,"" said the 
Mets
batting coach. ""The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are
celebrating prematurely.""Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of
all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the
umpires of each game. ""While some of the strikes called against the Mets
were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of
the World Series,"" the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal
claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won
the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.

""It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees,"" said

a Mets spokesman.  ""The World Series crown is rightly ours.""The manager of
the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging
for exercise.  He has stated that he believes ""we need to let the process
run its course without a rush to judgment.""

1982,"Dear Vince,

I hope you are well and that things round at Enron aren't too hectic. It is
my pleasure to invite you to speak at Energy & Power Risk Management
Magazine Conferences' new event, Australian Energy 2000, addressing the
second Industry Briefing - ""Learning from US experience: Lessons to be
learned from the restructuring North American markets"". I appreciate that
you are speaking a lot for us at the moment (for which I am of course
grateful) but, when researching, yours was a name that came up repeatedly
as someone the market would like to hear from. I am hoping that perhaps you
might need to see Paul Quilkey at some point in July and that we can
provide you with another reason to cross the globe.

Rather like the industry briefing that you are giving at Power 2000 this
year in Houston, this address will be presented to the entire conference
before breaking into their streams.

Australian Energy 2000 will take a focused look at the latest problems
facing energy players, with the two in-depth streams I mentioned above: one
dedicated to energy pricing and trading and the other looking at risk
management and the latest business issues.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that people have come
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage participation
from speakers in modifying the programme to suit the audience and issues at
hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please let
me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy & Power Risk
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to attract the
leading market players by providing a first-class programme with top-rated
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy industry.

I have attached a copy of the programme for your information.

Unfortunately my schedule for this event is very tight. Please let me know
if you would like to participate by reurn email as it is unlikely that we
can speak on the phone as I am currently based in Hong Kong. If you would
like to send a colleague, then I would be happy to discuss this but it
would be great if you could complete the EPRM grand slam by addressing our
three major annual events on three different continents!

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

The Henwood runs for Dabhol are, at least temporarily, over.  However, the 
main modeller for Henwood (David Yumigada) works out of their California 
office.

It maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs, and 
explain the modelling algorithm to the larger group.

In aparticular, now that I am going through some of the comments people have 
raised on the PSIM model, I think there is value in understanding the way 
Henwood deals with Hot and Cold Starts, ramp up costs, and with issues of 
cycling plants.

I think understanding these will help in developing the next version of the 
PSIM, and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models.  
This is a suggestion, and so please let me know if you see value in this.

I participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning.  There 
was a possibility Enron would invest in it.

Their product appears to be a GUI interface over the top of ILOG Solver (and 
possibly ILOG CPLEX) which allows problems to be expressed in high level 
terms.  I do not see any immediate application at Enron, but I am interested 
in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo.  Maybe it would be 
useful for general modelling projects here.

They do not even have a user manual for their software, so it will be 
difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged.  The 
possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ILOG software is a 
modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that 
market.  I think the scheduling tools in SAP, i2, etc are more likely to 
succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information 
system.

Because of the small market for this software, the many competitors, the 
absence of any clear use for it at Enron and the early stage of development, 
there is very little prospect of us funding this company.

2018,"Hello from Texas,

We are trying to set up our meeting date for the 2001 conference and have run 
into a snag.  We cannot get our San Antonio hotel on the first weekend in 
April (as last year).  However, we can get the hotel and make all our ""fun"" 
arrangements for the second weekend in April.  However, this is Easter 
weekend.  The good news is that the room rates are substantially lower 
because it's a holiday.  However, we are concerned that holding the meeting 
on this particular Friday-Saturday will interfere with family plans such that 
some or many of you may not be able to attend.  

My related question to you is this:

Does holding the meeting on the second weekend in April (Easter weekend) pose 
a problem for you?  Please give us your thoughts ASAP even if you think you 
may not be able to attend this year's conference.  We need your opinion to 
guide our decision.

Thanks and I hope to see you all again next April (sometime)!

FYI.

Prof. Gabriel Bitran of the M.I.T. management science department is planning 
to visit EBS on Wednesday, Aug. 9, to discuss research topics which might be 
of interest to EBS.   (This is Amit Dhadwal's advisor.)   He still has 25K of 
funding to use for research, but we are having a hard time coming up with a 
mutually suitable topic.   I have asked Samer to work with him in trying to 
come up with a research subject.


Stinson",Gabriel Bitran Amit Dhadwal's Samer Stinson,,Vince FYI M.I.T. EBS

I am sending you a recommendation regarding our cooperation with the Wharton
School, following my visit with Tom Piazze in May. Tom is a Corporate 
Relations Officer
at Wharton.

Recommendation.

I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership.
The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate
Wharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation. Currently,
the partnership supports alliances with approximately  200 companies 
worldwide.

The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $100K-150K,
that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE, 
Citigroup,
Goldman, Sachs & Co., Intel, and many others.  The contribution is executed 
through
grants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron. The 
choice
of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time
depending on the business needs.

Benefits to Enron. 

Enron can benefit from the Partnership by:

 - gaining advance access to current academic research  
 - significantly increasing our presence  and visibility on the campus,
   enhancing   our recruiting efforts
 - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant
                   influence on public opinion
        - gaining access to high quality executive education programs

Specific Programs.

The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects. 
I have
identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron.

1. WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative). This programs provides an umbrella
    for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research 
and 
    corporate engagement related to e-commerce.

    Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and
    enhanced recruitment opportunities.

2. Emerging Technologies Management Research Program. Interdisciplinary
    program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing 
intellectual
    property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal
    organizational structures.

    Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of 
valuation of
    intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.

3. Risk Management and Decision Process Center. Development of techniques for
    assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the 
scope
    of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments). 

    Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination
    of information about our capabilities in this area.

Potential users of the program at Enron.

My group could coordinate the cooperation with the Risk Management and 
Decision Process Center.

Greg Whalley is a potential customer for WeBI. Several different units of 
Enron can be involved 
with  Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.

2025,"Erin,

A book by Martha Amram and Nalin Kulatilaka is an excellent
non-technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most 
important
references to more advanced books and papers.
The book has an endorsement  by Jeff Skilling on the cover page.

The Research Group offered  several one-day seminars on real options
and applications to the energy industry. We still have a few binders with
the presentation materials available if you are interested.
We plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall.
The first part of the seminar (about 4 hours in the morning) covers general 
concept of real options
and their applicability to the energy business.
The second, more technical afternoon session, covers stochastic processes used
to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case
studies (valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas-fired 
power plants).

The real options approach has been developed specifically to address the 
problem of making
investment decisions under uncertainty. Nobody in this field claims that this 
is a
perfect tool, but it represents a significant progress compared to other 
techniques developed
earlier.

Discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through
analysis of several, in most cases, arbitrary scenarios (most likely, 
optimistic,
pessimistic). These scenarios don't identify explicitly the risk drivers
and don't specify the future proactive management decisions.

The real, option approach is very powerful because it allows to (1) capture
uncertainty in an explicit way and  (2) to design investment projects that
allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to 
downside risk.
This approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and 
future
operational decisions. Forward-looking investment decisions create options 
that are exercised
in the future through active management of a project.

The real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to 
come
up with the representation of future possible states of the world. The real 
challenge is
to use these tools in a sensible way. I have seen in my career (almost 30 
years
of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems) many quants 
armed with 
powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers. The 
challenge is not
to run mechanically  thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions
but to translate in a  creative   way the insights of people who understand 
specific  businesses
into parsimonious quantitative models. It is especially critical to 
stress-test the assumptions
of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends 
critically on any set of assumptions.
If this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying 
assumptions.
I remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the 
dynamics of oil prices,
but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very 
optimistic  upward trend.
One would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question 
what Economics 101
teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand.

2028,"Dear guys

Having been out of the office for a couple of days, I've found myself the 
victim of theft (again).  This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from 
its ""hiding place"" under my telephone.  I *always* lock my drawers and keep 
the key in the same place, but on arriving in the office today I found the 
drawers unlocked, and the key missing.  Although there's nothing sensitive on 
or around my desk, I'm concerned about the security implications of someone 
sniffing around the office in this manner.  I also found the papers on my 
desk extensively reshuffled last week.

Last year, in our old office, I had my only two real options books stolen 
from among the many and varied books on my desk.  That couldn't have been a 
random theft, and I fear this isn't either.  I can't understand who'd be so 
interested in a Research guy's belongings!

Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious 
activity around my desk?

I can reserve 2 to 2:30 time slot  but there  is really not much that
I can tell you at this point.

The commercial groups are still interested and are moving 
towards the test of the package.  As soon as they will decide
to move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the 
product. As I have  said, we are not the 
decision makers in this case. 

I think that we should allow simply the process to run its course.

Today's focus: Two Linux fixes and a PHP patch

By Jason Meserve


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* Debian patches enscript

Enscript, a tool for converting ASCII files into other formats,
has been found to use insecure temporary files in its
operation. Debian users can download a fix and get more
information from:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-105


* Chuid program patched

Two bugs in chuid, a small program designed to solve a problem
created by PHP's safe_mode - which makes it so that non-Web
server-owned PHP scripts can't accept file uploads - could
allow a user to change uid of files outside the designated
upload directory and change files owned by root or the Web
server. An updated version of chuid can be downloaded from:
http://srparish.net/scripts/chuid-1.3.tar.gz


* Linux-Mandrake updates jmcce

There is a problem with the way jmcce, a tool for displaying
Chinese text on the console, creates temporary files. A
malicious user could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files
on the affected system. For more, go to:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/security/2002/MDKSA-2002-008.php


Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* WM97/Dig-C - No, this is not about Boston's notorious Big
Dig. This is a harmless Word macro virus that uses a temporary
file to replicate and may display a message in Cyrillic
characters. (Sophos)

* Top 5 viruses for the week of Jan. 14 to 20, as reported by
CA:

1. Win32.Badtrans.29020
2. Win32.Magistr.29188
3. Win32.Magistr.24876
4. Win32.SirCam.137216
5. Win32.Hybris.B


>From the interesting reading department:


* ScanDo pokes, prods, secures Web apps

Web application security firm KaVaDo Tuesday beefed up its line
of products when it announced a new vulnerability-assessment
tool for Web applications called ScanDo. ScanDo approaches and
probes Web applications the same way an attacker would and in
doing so, discovers vulnerabilities in the applications,
reports on them and allows companies to patch the holes,
according to Tal Gilat, CEO of KaVaDo.

IDG News Service, 01/22/02


* Subscription snafu angers Norton users

It's a rare company that turns away customers, but Symantec's
subscription renewal service for Norton AntiVirus appears to be
doing just that to some users - albeit unintentionally.

PC World, 01/24/02


* Schwartau: Cyber ethics in the workplace

While moderating a game of ""Cyber ethical Surfivor"" at a large,
financial conference recently, I posed the following conundrum:
""You receive an anonymous e-mail which includes all the
technical and business details of a key competitor's project.
Your company is way behind. If you use the information, you
will likely beat your competitor and you will be a hero. If you
don't use the information, your company will lose a great deal
of money and you will likely be the scapegoat. If you use the
information, no one - except you - will ever know. What do you
do?""

* Gibbs: Let's do IT with a dongle

If I build something physical, say a chair, and you steal it, I
have lost the benefit of my labor. Now I think no one in their
right mind would suggest such an action is ethical or
defensible.

Title: Atlantic Basin Heating Oil Markets Well Supplied Before Winter
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2800;


***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market
boosted distillate demand.

Title: The Spanish Gas Auction: A Precedent for Europe?
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2811;


***********************************************************************

A SMALL STEP FOR SPAIN, BUT AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR EUROPE

The recent auction of contract gas in Spain represents an early initiative both
to release gas from preexisting long-term contracts and to make it available to
aspiring market entrants. As such, CERA believes it could provide a precedent
for other European markets (and for their regulators) where release gas
programs have not so far been on the public agenda.

*  The Spanish gas release program, as currently devised, will have limited
impact on domestic competition. However, pressure will grow in Spain to extend
the program.

*  By setting a unique precedent across Continental Europe, Spain has signaled
a possible path for the reforms needed on the supply-side to complete the
European gas internal market.

*  The role of credit risk and sovereign guarantees will be critical in any
reallocation or renegotiation of long-term contracts.

Hot Off the Cyberpress!
A new Grant's publication is now available at www.grantspub.com.
Here are highlights of the newest


THE EPIDEMIC THAT WASN'T
    This country was founded in terror. The 17th-century Puritan settlers
confronted the New England winter and King Philip's braves. They lived in
fear of the pope and his legions of Frenchmen. In the summer of the signing
of the Declaration of Independence, smallpox posed a greater danger to
American patriots than the redcoats did. . . .

AT ANY RATE
    On the train from Narita Airport to downtown Tokyo, a uniformed girl
sells drinks from a cart. Reaching the end of an aisle, she pauses, turns to
face the inattentive passengers, smiles broadly, performs a deliberate, steep
bow and wheels her drinks into the next car. Commerce works differently in a
society in which rank and deference sometimes precede supply and demand.


YIELDS WITH HAIR
    The bear market in credit has created opportunity as well as loss,
distress, apprehension and a general flu-like malaise. Following are some
interest-generating investment ideas contributed by knowledgeable high-yield
practitioners, starting with one from Anand Iyer, head of convertible-bond
research at Morgan Stanley.


CROSSED UP
    Not one visionary expected that anything so pedestrian as debt would
thwart the technological destiny of Global Crossing, the Western Union of the
21st century. Yet the company hangs by a thread.


DATING GUIDE
    Asserting that the U.S. has entered a new age of productivity growth,
defenders of the bullish faith are fond of citing the 2.5% annual growth rung
up in the golden years, 1995-2000. This record they compare to the lamentable
1.3% annual growth posted in 1973-95.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm

Today's focus: Panda: Virus authors getting trickier

By Jason Meserve


I got a couple of interesting items in my inbox this week. The
first was an antivirus vendor press release doing the annual
look-back-at-last-year and look-forward-to-this-year pitch.

The Panda Software release says virus authors are getting more
tricky in their attempts to spread viruses, using social
engineering techniques to get unsuspecting users to open their
malicious wares. Panda is hoping that 2002 will not be a repeat
of 2001, when a number of simple ""bait"" messages caused mass
mailing viruses to spread like wildfire.

Panda also suspects that viruses in 2002 will go after known
system exploits like buffer overflows to run code on infected
machines. Users are urged to keep systems and antivirus
software up-to-date with the latest patches and updates. Sounds
like common sense to me. For more, go to:
http://www.pandasoftware.com/

The second item was an e-mail alert sent around by the authors
of the SiliconValley.com newsletter warning that their systems
had been hacked and used to send messages infected with
Magistr.B virus. Not good when a major media outlet's systems
are hacked and used to attack unsuspecting readers. Let's hope
Network World's systems never suffer such a fate.


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* More mutt updates available from Linux vendors

A buffer overflow in mutt's e-mail address parser could be
exploited by a malicious user to overwrite arbitrary bytes in
memory. Red Hat users can download new versions of mutt from:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-003.html

Linux-Mandrake users can get more from:
http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/advisories/2002/MDKSA-2002-002.php

Conectiva users:
http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000449

SuSE users:
http://lists2.suse.com/archive/suse-security-announce/2002-Jan/0000.html

Trustix users:
http://www.trustix.org/pipermail/tsl-announce/2002-January/000045.html


* Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router vulnerability

According to an alert from Cisco, three vulnerabilities have
been discovered in Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router software
releases up to and including 1.1(5). Two of the vulnerabilities
can cause a denial-of-service attack. The other allows access
to the SN 5420 configuration if it has been previously saved on
the router. There is no workaround for these vulnerabilities.
For more, go to:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/SN-multiple-pub.shtml


* SGI reports NQE vulnerability

The Network Queuing Environment (NQE) that shipped in the past
with SGI contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow
vulnerability that could lead to a malicious user gaining root
access. SGI considers this product retired and will not be
releasing a patch for the problem. For more, go to:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20020101-01-I


* Sun releases patch for CDE Subprocess Control Service

A buffer overflow flaw in the CDE Subprocess Control Service
(dtspcd) daemon could be exploited by a malicious user to gain
root access on the affected system. Sun users can download the
appropriate patch from:
http://sunsolve.sun.com/securitypatch


* Debian patches libgtop

Two flaws in the libgtop daemon could allow a malicious user to
gain privileges of the application, usually those for the
""nobody"" user. Debian users can get more information and
patches from:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-098


* Microsoft investigating alleged flaw in IE browser

Microsoft said it's investigating an alleged flaw in recent
versions of its Internet Explorer browser software that could
allow attackers to spoof legitimate Web sites, steal content
from browser cookies and gain access to certain types of files
on a victim's system.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0108ieflaw.html
Computerworld, 01/08/02


* Linux-Mandrake updates BIND

Previous versions of BIND 9.x that shipped with Linux-Mandrake
8.0 and 8.1 contain insecure permissions, configuration files
and executables. This new release tightens things up a bit. For
more, go to:
http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/advisories/2002/MDKSA-2002-001.php


* Red Hat fixes exim

A flaw in the way exim handles some incoming data could expose
the affected system to arbitrary malicious code. For more, go
to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-176.html


* Patch available for stunnel

Red Hat has released a patch for stunnel to fix a format string
vulnerability that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code
on the affected system. For more, go to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-002.html


* Conectiva patches proftpd

Two vulnerabilities in proftpd could allow a malicious user to
bypass some security features or launch a denial-of-service
attack against the affected machine. For more, go to:
http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000450


Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* First virus identified that infects Shockwave Flash files

Antivirus software vendors say they have spotted the first
computer virus that uses Macromedia's Shockwave Flash files to
transmit itself once a victim clicks to run the Flash movie.
Identified as SWF/LFM-926 by antivirus software vendor Sophos,
this virus is not yet ""in the wild,"" infecting computers. The
Shockwave Flash virus was sent to Sophos as a sample via
anonymous e-mail, and this specimen is now being shared and
analyzed among several antivirus vendors.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0108flashvirus.html
Network World, 01/08/02

* XM97/Bdoc2-A - An Excel macro virus that displays a message
on April 26 and attempts to shut down the current Windows
session if the day is a multiple of 5. (Sophos)

* WM97/Opey-AX - A Word macro virus that changes user summary
information in the infected document. It also makes changes to
the autoexec.bat file to display a Happy Birthday message on
certain days of the year. (Sophos)

* W32.Donut - A virus only Homer Simpson could love. Symantec
reports this is a concept virus designed to test potential
weaknesses in Microsoft's .Net architecture. (Symantec)


>From the interesting reading department:


* Suggested fix for AIM hole has back door, spyware

Software recommended by security group w00w00 to plug a hole in
AOL's Instant Messenger opens the user's system to hacker
attacks and can direct the user's Web browser to pornographic
Web sites,"" w00w00 said Tuesday.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0109aimhole.html
IDG News Service, 01/09/02


* Many U.S. companies at risk for cyberattacks

U.S. computer systems are increasingly vulnerable to
cyberattacks, partly because companies are not implementing
security measures already available, according to a new report
released Tuesday.
http://digitalmass.boston.com/news/2002/01/08/cyber_attack.html
Reuters, 01/08/02


* Wireless LAN security fix on tap from IEEE group

Network executives worried about the security of their wireless
LANs may soon be able to sleep a little easier: The standards
committee responsible for the broken wireless LAN encryption
algorithm, Wired Equivalent Privacy, has approved a fix to the
system that can be applied to existing equipment.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/128615_01-07-2002.html

IDG News Service, 01/08/02


* Secure IM software proliferates

The market for secure, business-grade instant messaging
software is picking up steam, with several start-ups now
offering packages that automatically encrypt real-time chat
sessions between users. However, these packages do not yet
offer secure communications with users of popular consumer-
oriented IM systems from AOL, Microsoft and others.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0109secureim.html
Network World Fusion, 01/09/02


* NetScreen offers new VPN-firewall gear

NetScreen this week introduced VPN gear that makes it possible
for users to tailor-fit protection for specific network
resources without having to buy multiple boxes. Four new
NetScreen VPN appliances have at least four 10/100 Ethernet
ports, each of which can oversee a separate, independently
configured security domain.

rashed By Tax Selling

                  But are there bargains among the discards?


                  By Michael Santoli


                  Here it is more than six months since even the most 
intransigent last-minute
                  filers wrote checks to the IRS to render to the government 
its due for their
                  financial good fortune in 1999. By rights, this should be a 
season relatively
                  free of concerns about taxes, notwithstanding the 
presidential candidates'
                  parrying over whose tax-cut math features more fuzz.

                  And yet, for anyone with a dollar in the stock market 
(which in recent weeks
                  has likely been reduced to loose change), the looming 
demands of this year's
                  levies on capital gains have helped to make this month yet 
another taxing
                  October for investors.

                                                 The jump-and-stumble course 
the
                                                 major stock indexes have 
taken this
                                                 year is being blamed for a
                                                 particularly intense effort 
among
                                                 mutual-fund managers and 
other big
                                                 investors to sell their 
losers. The
                                                 steep ramp-up in stocks that
                                                 persisted from the fall of 
1999
                                                 through the first quarter of 
this year
                                                 -- led by the technology
                                                 must-haves -- left funds 
with ripe
                                                 profit-taking opportunities 
when the
                                                 Nasdaq surge flagged in 
April. This
                  sell-high activity generated heavy capital gains in many 
portfolios -- tax
                  liabilities that managers have been rushing to offset with 
realized losses by
                  selling stocks that have cratered.

                  The fact that so many funds are enduring a flat-to-down 
year in this difficult
                  market has only added to the urgency. Investors aren't fond 
of getting stuck
                  with taxable distributions in even the most flush years of 
a bull market. So
                  managers are now trading in fear of how their shareholders 
will react to funds'
                  kicking off gains distributions in a year when the value of 
their holdings fails to
                  appreciate or, worse, falls outright. With the majority of 
funds operating on an
                  October 31 fiscal year end, and given a trend toward 
letting investors know
                  their estimated tax hit well before year's end, much of 
this selling has been
                  concentrated in a brief period of weeks.

                  One fund executive attending a Fidelity mutual-fund 
conference last week
                  reported that, oddly, some managers have resolved to be 
contrary and
                  ""overdo it"" in selling even their winners. The theory, he 
reports, is that if
                  they're going to have a capital-gains distribution anyway, 
the most skittish
                  shareholders will sell the fund to avoid the payout and its 
tax liability, whether
                  it's, say, either 10% or 12% of net asset value. So the 
idea is to take profits
                  and ""reload"" for the benefit of those investors who will 
stick around.

                  Now, with the Nasdaq off 22.7% since Labor Day and 8% so 
far in
                  October, much talk is bubbling about suggesting that the 
assault is ending.
                  This line of reasoning counsels that it's time to peek out 
of the foxhole and
                  survey the wreckage for some badly damaged stocks to pick 
up in
                  expectation of a late-year rally.

                  Not so fast. While it's true that in past years, these 
hard-hit tax-selling victims
                  tend to recover in the early part of November, the move 
often proves fleeting.
                  Like a ball being held under water, these stocks jump when 
the downward
                  pressure is released, but that doesn't mean they escape 
gravity's pull for long.
                  Soon enough, they're hit by a secondary wave of selling by 
investors who tidy
                  up their tax situation closer to the end of the year.

                  The quantitative equity research team at Lehman Brothers 
has studied recent
                  market history in search of patterns in tax-driven selling. 
In the process, the
                  analysts came up with a list of 131 stocks that look 
vulnerable to persistent
                  weakness through most of the fourth quarter. The study 
scanned the Russell
                  3000 index -- basically the 3,000 largest U.S. stocks -- 
for those that had
                  fallen at least 40% this year through September, and had 
lost at least 10% in
                  the prior six months. They also plucked only those stocks 
that had seen rising
                  trading volume over that period. The idea was to find only 
those names that
                  seem to be in the throes of a selling crescendo. In 1997, 
there were just eight
                  such stocks. In 1998, there were 202 and last year 101, on 
a par with this
                  year's tired crop.

                  Murali Ramaswami of Lehman says, ""There's both a tax-loss 
story and a
                  momentum story. Losers continue to be losers."" At least 
through the fourth
                  quarter they do.

                                       The negative momentum of these stocks 
tends to
                                       gather speed from the first week of 
November to
                  Christmas. In this period, from 1997 through last year, the 
Losers Portfolio
                  dropped an average of 20% more than did the Russell 3000 
index.
                  Bottom-fishers, beware.

                  The resulting list, which Lehman billed to its 
institutional clients as a menu for
                  hungry short-sellers, features numerous stocks caught in 
the major downside
                  themes of the year. Name a major telecom-services provider 
and the odds
                  are good it's in this bunch, the result of a stampede away 
from the group. Big
                  retailers also dot the down-on-their-luck roster, as the 
slowing economy has
                  ravaged shares of Circuit City, Dillards, Saks and others. 
And of course there
                  are plenty of dot.com names experiencing the ugly side of a 
mania undone, in
                  a reversal that has made some mere flyspecks on the 
market's windshield.
                  Witness Barnesandnoble.com and Razorfish.

                  An intrepid prospector surveying this list in a quest for 
next year's Comeback
                  Stock of the Year will encounter no shortage of companies 
that appear, for
                  the moment, broken and in need of an inspired strategic 
revamping, some
                  slick investor-relations work and plenty of luck. Former 
blue chips such as
                  Lucent Technologies, Bausch & Lomb and Dial seem to fall 
into that club,
                  where for investors a love of dirt-cheap stocks and a 
strong backbone is the
                  price of admission. DuPont, which recently ratcheted down 
its 2001 growth
                  forecast and is beset by high raw-materials costs, is 
arguably apt to remain in
                  the investors' time-out chair for a while as well. That its 
shares failed to sell off
                  after a limp earnings report last week is perhaps the most 
hopeful sign one can
                  seize on with regard to the chemicals giant.

                  Still, for the investor patient enough to endure what could 
be a stormy
                  November and December, a few sizable companies with 
temporary problems
                  but solid long-term growth stories are attracting some fund 
managers looking
                  to buy. As detailed in Barron's last week (""Retailers on 
Sale,"" October 23),
                  there is reason to expect better performance from selected 
retail chains.
                  Federated Department Stores, the parent of Macy's and 
Bloomingdale's,
                  merits attention both for its buoyant same-store sales 
growth in a retail
                  headwind and for its repair of the addled Fingerhut 
catalogue division, which
                  suffered a spike in delinquencies. The shares are off their 
trough levels in the
                  low 20s, but a recent quote of 28 still seems a 
better-than-fair price for a
                  company that some pros believe could earn more than $5 a 
share next year.

                  The advertising business this year is being given the cold 
shoulder by investors
                  after a torrid love affair through 1999. Fearing that the 
dot.com washout and
                  resultant cash drought would wither the bottom line of ad 
firms, investors
                  abandoned Interpublic, the third-largest owner of ad 
agencies after WPP and
                  Omnicom.

                  But Mark Greenberg, manager of the Invesco Leisure fund, 
saw a chance to
                  pick up a ""good, solid company"" inexpensively when 
Interpublic hit the low
                  30s. Now at 39, Interpublic is still fetching just 22 times 
forecast 2001
                  earnings, which are expected to grow 15%, faster than 
profits for the overall
                  market.

                  ""I bought some early this year and added to it just 
recently. The bad news is
                  probably priced into the stock, and then some,"" he says.

                  Madison Avenue markdown

                  Interpublic, parent of McCann Erickson, among other firms, 
has always
                  suffered a bit in comparison with Omnicom, a market darling 
considered the
                  class operator in the industry. But Interpublic now trades 
at a discounted
                  valuation, and is briskly expanding its direct-marketing 
and public-relations
                  business, which are growing faster than the traditional 
Madison Avenue game.
                  Add in the fact that only a sliver of its business comes 
from dot.coms and that
                  half its revenues are collected overseas, and Interpublic 
appears well insulated
                  from crippling economic forces.

                  In a more prosaic corner of the ad business sits Valassis 
Communications, a
                  big coupon distributor, which produces the colorful inserts 
that fall out of your
                  Sunday paper. A well-loved growth stock that pleased many a 
small and
                  mid-cap fund manager in 1999, Valassis this year ran into a 
nettlesome
                  combination of higher paper prices and stiffer price 
competition in one of its
                  insert categories. Investors bailed out in droves, halving 
the stock from a high
                  above 44 to just north of 20. Now at 25, the shares are 
""absurdly cheap,""
                  says Greenberg, who also owns Valassis.

                  Another fund manager points out that the company has taken 
control of its
                  troubles, with hedged paper prices and a move to cut supply 
in products
                  where pricing declined. Even with its growth forecast 
revised downward,
                  Valassis is still expected to increase profits at a 10%-15% 
long-term rate, and
                  earnings next year should rise close to 12%, to $2.50 a 
share. That leaves the
                  stock at a mere 10 times next year's profits. And it's 
worth noting that in times
                  of slower economic growth, coupons are among the things 
that companies
                  continue to offer to bargain-hunters.

                  With a new wave of tax selling due to bear down on haggard 
stocks any
                  week now, it might feel as if the typical first-quarter 
rebound in the year's
                  losers that's been documented by Lehman Brothers is 
hopelessly distant.

                  If you're tempted nonetheless to plunge ahead and buy a 
beaten-down mutual
                  fund, check first to see if it will be among those making a 
capital-gains
                  distribution later this year. In that case, you'll be on 
the hook for the tax even
                  though you didn't participate in the gain. (You can take 
the plunge without
                  worrying about payouts if you're buying the fund for a 
tax-deferred account
                  such as a 401(k) or an IRA.)

                  But at least in selected stocks, it seems the machinations 
of tax-fearing
                  investors have created the stock market equivalent of a 
25%-off sale, and you
                  don't need to redeem a manufacturer's coupon to take 
advantage.

This is just a short reminder about the four letters of recommendation. 

I have attached an envelope with each recommendation. Once you 
seal each envelope, please don't forget to sign it (over the adhesive 
seal) and to label the front, e.g. ""Columbia - Joseph Hrgvocic"". Also, 
I will be mailing everything in one package to each university, so 
please don't mail them out.

That is all. As always, I really do appreciate the time you're taking to 
do this.

Thank you,

Please see below some of the ideas being bounced, FYI.  Please keep this 
confidential.

The unused capacity in Maharashtra should be dispatched on a merchant basis, 
ON BEHALF OF MSEB to any customers outside MSEB's current purview.  I would 
like us to look at the whole issue as one of MSEB's poor credit, and hence ( 
as Jeff pointed out on the call), one where we need to identify all deep 
pockets in and out of Maharashtra.
Secondly, there is (as Shubh and I had pointed out) the ability to evacuate 
about 700-1000 MW to customers other than MSEB.  The challege is - at what 
price, and in coordination with which agencies.  As always, in India your 
greatest challenge will be in dealing with govt. agencies.  
Another point to consider is that in-all we have about 5-7 customers 
identified.  Will all the customers we have earmarked bite ???  This is the 
reason why systems need to be set up with a bulletin board on pricing 10-15 
day power on the screens of the different SEBs we can connect up with.  This 
also substantially gets around the credit quality issue, as this would be an 
arrangement akin to cash-and-carry.  I see a lot of hope for such a 
strategy.  I do not see much hope for a strategy of selling blocks of power 
to either NTPC or PTC.  I would agree however, that we not put all our eggs 
in one basket, and hence you could designate a team to look into the NTPC 
sale issue inparallel.
In order to set up the trading sytems, however, we need to start by the end 
of Q1 2001, and just start doing small deals where we break even, simply to 
test the waters and introduce liquidity into the market.
Hand-in-hand with this we need a fuel risk management strategy, as I have 
been pushing for.  For this to happen, we need to get the Special Import 
Licence reinstated.  If that is not possible, we need to lobby with the 
highest authorities within govt. and RBi to allow for hedging, irrespective 
of whether we have an SIL.  The discussions being held with IOC are therefore 
very important in this regard, and I am going to get Anshuman and Mukesh 
involved with the same.
Finally, I do not see much hope for your strategy of asking ENE management 
for $75 Million to build transmission lines in a country where the regulatory 
framework on transmission access is even less defined and understood than the 
generation side of the equation.  I would refrain from stating this in any 
senior management forum until we are able to clearly demonstrate the 
cost-benefit of this.  I have some ideas on that side which I need to develop 
further.

Sandeep.","Jeff Anshuman Mukesh

                    Do the math. The slogan favoured by Jim Clark, creator of 
Silicon Graphics,
                    Net-scape and Healtheon, has become the mantra of a 
generation of
                    consultants and investment bankers. The new economy, they 
claim, requires
                    new principles of valuation. 

                    C.com is one of the most exciting prospects in 
business-to-business
                    commerce. It is the world leader in a growing market - 
annual sales by 2010
                    are likely to be Dollars 500,000bn. If C.com can maintain 
a 5 per cent share
                    and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective 
annual earnings will be
                    Dollars 250bn. 

                    If we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent 
and discount future
                    revenues at 10 per cent, the prospective value of C.com 
is Dollars 5,000bn -
                    about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of 
Microsoft, Cisco or General
                    Electric. 

                    You don't have to wait for the IPO. You can buy shares in 
C.com right now for
                    less than 5 per cent of that value. C.com is called 
Citigroup and in addition to
                    its foreign exchange trading, which is the business I 
have described, you get
                    its other wholesale, retail and investment banking 
activities and a leading
                    insurance company thrown in. 

                    Of course, nobody would be so stupid as to value 
Citigroup in this way. Yet I
                    have followed more or less exactly the methodology 
recommended in the
                    latest McKinsey quarterly for the valuation of new era 
companies. They use
                    precisely analogous calculations to arrive at a valuation 
of Dollars 37bn for
                    Amazon.com. 

                    Paul Gibbs, head of merger and acquisition research at 
J.P. Morgan, recently
                    used similar principles to confirm that assessment of 
Amazon. He then
                    performed the same calculation for internet service 
provider Freeserve. 

                    Assume that UK retail sales grow at 5 per cent a year, 
that 25 per cent of
                    sales take place on the net, that portals capture 50 per 
cent of these, that
                    Freeserve gets 30 per cent of the portal share and 
maintains an 8 per cent
                    commission on sales. Multiply these together and you 
establish that in 2017
                    Freeserve will make profits of o2bn (Dollars 3.2bn). 
This, he argues, justifies a
                    value today of o6.50 per share. 

                    But I prefer T.com to Freeserve. T.com has a customer 
base four times larger
                    than Freeserve. Its franchise is stronger. Its customers 
are concentrated in
                    the affluent south-east of England, where it faces 
virtually no competition.
                    Market research shows that more than 95 per cent of its 
customers use its
                    essential services every day, many of them several times 
a day. 

                    T.com also has ambitious plans for expansion. At present, 
its geographical
                    coverage is less than one-quarter of the market in 
England and Wales. T.com
                    has an interest in south-east Asia. The population of 
China is 100 times the
                    number of people who today can access T.com services. 
Even after the recent
                    market correction, T.com, better known as Thames Water, 
still has a market
                    valuation below that of Freeserve. At the widest point 
between the old and new
                    economies, Freeserve was worth four times as much. 

                    The reason the Citibank calculation is nonsense is 
simple, but fundamental.
                    The margins Citibank makes on its forex business vary 
widely. If you buy
                    small quantities of notes from a bank, the spread is much 
wider than 1 per
                    cent. If you are a large corporation trading major 
currencies, the margin is
                    wafer thin. Entry and competition force prices down to 
the related costs. 

                    In Mr Gibbs's model, Freeserve earns profits of o2bn, 
about equal to the
                    current profits of Tesco, J. Sainsbury and Marks and 
Spencer together. And it
                    earns these on revenues of only o2.5bn, so that profits 
are 80 per cent of the
                    value of its sales. No established business earns margins 
of that size. 

                    Thames Water is one of a tiny number of companies whose 
market position is
                    so strong, whose output is so necessary to life, that if 
it charged five times the
                    current price we would have little choice but to pay. We 
do have one option -
                    to insist the government intervenes. It confines Thames 
Water to a return on
                    its capital employed of about 6 per cent. 

                    The idea that profit is a return on capital invested 
still has some role in new
                    economy valuation, at the level of the overall market. 

                    There is a key formula in the new math. The required 
yield on a security is
                    equal to the difference between the rate of return 
demanded from that class of
                    securities and its expected rate of growth. So, if you 
expect a return of 5.5 per
                    cent from a share whose dividends will grow at 5 per 
cent, calculations show
                    that the dividend yield should be 0.5 per cent. 

                    This is the calculation done by James Glassman and Kevin 
Hassett in their
                    book Dow 36,000*. Claiming that sustainable dividends 
average half of
                    earnings, this yield equates to a price/earnings ratio of 
100 - implying a target
                    of 36,000 for the US index. 

                    The trouble with this theory is that it takes too long to 
produce what the
                    investor is looking for. Investors will receive only 
two-fifths of the cash
                    sustaining the valuation this century. One-third of the 
total depends on
                    dividend cheques that will arrive after 2200. 

                    Two hundred years ago, well before the Dow Jones average, 
prudent,
                    diversified investors would have owned slave traders and 
sugar plantations, or
                    perhaps a bold speculation in that symbol of the then new 
economy -a canal.
                    The next 200 years may be more stable than the last and 
Microsoft and Cisco
                    may prove more enduring than plantations. But we can 
hardly be sure. 

                    While 5 per cent may be a reasonable assumption for the 
growth rate of
                    dividends in the US economy as a whole, it is likely that 
well before 2200
                    most of these will come from companies not yet founded. 

                    Suppose we accept Glassman and Hassett's protests that 
their dividend
                    growth expectations are conservative. If you raise them 
only from 5 per cent to
                    5.25 per cent, the anticipated value of the Dow Jones 
average is 72,000. At
                    5.5 per cent the formula breaks down because the shares 
of US companies
                    are infinitely valuable. Not even the most credulous 
dotcom investor believes
                    that. 

                    The math also works in reverse. If expectations of return 
are 6 per cent rather
                    than 5.5 per cent, the market p/e ratio falls to 50 and 
the value of the Dow
                    Jones from 36,000 to 18,000. And if equity investors 
require a return of 8 per
                    cent, you would have to conclude that shares are worth 
only half their current
                    level. 

                    An 8 per cent expected total return is not ambitious for 
an equity investor. A
                    day trader might think you were talking about a weekly 
profit rather than
                    annual. Glassman and Hassett use a figure as low as 5.5 
per cent - the return
                    on Treasury bonds - because they argue that equities have 
so consistently
                    outperformed bonds that there is now no risk associated 
with equity
                    investment. In other words, because equities are sure to 
offer higher returns
                    than bonds, the expected yield on equities should be the 
same as on bonds. 

                    You do not have to be Wittgenstein to spot the flaw. The 
rules of logic hold
                    even in cyberspace, and so do the principles of 
economics. Profits are hard to
                    earn in competitive businesses, and markets that are not 
competitive are
                    usually regulated. The value of companies ultimately 
depends on their
                    capacity to generate cash for shareholders. Distant 
returns are uncertain.
                    Share prices are volatile, and investors need to be 
compensated for the risks.
                    These truths are as valid in the new economy as the old. 

                    By all means do the math. Isaac Newton, who could do the 
math better than
                    most, gave up an annuity of o650 per year to invest in 
the South Sea Bubble.
                    In addition to the math, you need the econ, the pol, and 
perhaps the
                    psychology.

The Rofr option, which grants the shipper the right to lock in the 
transportation rate (max rate) for next
a few years, is priced as a spread swaption. 

I priced two scenarios for you:  the strip starts 1) Nov.1-00 and 2)Nov. 1-01.
For the first one I assume that the shipper makes decision on Oct. 31,00 (54 
days  to maturity)
and  on Oct. 31,01(419 days to maturity)  for the second case.

The second case has longer time to expiration, therefore larger option time

2151,"Hi Stinson, as per our discussion, here is the e-mail from Jim on the 
subject.  I convinced Jim that this type of modeling effort is our gig and he 
completely agrees.  As per Jim's suggestion, he and I will talk more on the 
product while we are in Denver. I suspect that we will arrange for the vendor 
to come to Houston and do a presentation on the product and install the 
product on our machines.   As for additional development we should get John 
Bloomer and Jim together in a meeting and hash out the requirements from John 
Bloomer's perspective.

Using Vince's analogy, this tool allows us to deternime the size of the cargo 
space needed for Fedex-like delivery (our streaming media products). Whereas, 
the optical light path switching (DS-3, OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48) based trading 
will reserve the underlying airline routes, etc.  So the packet based stuff 
is looking at the required capacity from IP layer (Network and Transport: 
level 3 and 4) requirements. The optical light path is Level 1 & 2 based 
requirements.  That is this tool will allow John Bloomer to size (actually we 
will do the analysis for him) the capacity requirement that he would need for 
the products that he is developing.

That is my take on the difference, we'll find out otherwise.

Once I finish off this discussion with Jim in Denver, I suggest putting 
Martin Lin on the job to find out more about the product and do the leg work 
to arrange for vendor demo and software installation.  Martin will keep Samer 
and Chonawee updated on the information that he gathers.  Martin please start 
checking on the web about this company and other similiar produts. I will get 
you contact number for EBS and the vendor as soon as Jim provides them to 
me.  

Avici uses this product. Avici is a next generation router vendor that is 
selling Terabit routers. EBS is an investor in that company.

You are representing Martin Lin, an associate currently in the research

promotion at the PRC meeting for us.

Martin has spent the last four months supporting EBS.   His primary project 
has been development of a simulation model for analyzing the capability of 
the media-cast product running on the EBS network.   This type of analysis is 
critical to understanding what types of bottlenecks we might encounter in 
trying to service, for example, the Blockbuster deal.   Martin has already 
come  up to speed so that he is able to largely replace an expensive 
contractor from Lucent who is under contract to support this modelling 
effor.   Prior to supporting EBS, Martin used his engineering skills (B.S. 
Caltech, Ph.D. U.of Texas in EE) to create models of regional power 
transmission networks in order to better understand possible congestion 
constraints.  

In our internal pre-ranking meeting we felt that Martin was deserving of a

and work ethic, and his ability to move projects forward with minimal

***********************************************************************

STRUCTURAL RISK AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY GROW IN INFLUENCE IN REGIONAL GAS
MARKETS.

The dramatic increase of participants in the daily market for natural gas over
the past several years has brought with it the demand for pricing indices that
are increasingly regional and selective in nature. These published indices
provide a valuable service to the market, but the high level of confidence that
the general trading community has bestowed upon them may be misplaced.

*  Current economic conditions are masking hidden volatility potential,
especially at local index points that have unrealized demand potential.

*  Large, volatile demand in the form of new gas-fired generation utilizes the
existing pipeline system in ways that were never envisioned in the original
system design.

*  Control of pipeline infrastructure has moved from the relatively benign
local distribution companies to economically driven traders and asset managers.

*  As demand grows, physical flexibility in the system and the number of buyers
and sellers decrease on the margin.

2161,"Vince,

  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
more about this.

  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
prices.

  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London.
We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate 
this process.
Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around 
him
any longer.

I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase.
I would like to offer him a significant increase that
goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility.
A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.
 We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in 
practically every location
where we operate.

A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false 
security for
both an employee and the company.

I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc

Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards 
understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no
bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated
credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the 
code.

Regarding Tanya's attitude. Just a few points. 

1. I don't think she has the skills to do the system administrator's work
and she does not have the
necessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help. 
It's
not that the work is beneath her.

2. Some members of Tanya's team came to me complaining about Winston.
He effectively told them to go away and work on the ""research projects""
and that he would take care of the IT issues. I don't think that it's just 
Tanya's issue,
though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.

3. The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat  on 
Tanya and
me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively
disagree with the results of a run. They could not care less about the
demarcation line between IT and Research. They also want Tanya
to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.

The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya and
Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that 
it happens.
Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and
the system cannot fail.

A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.

I. Projects (in the order they suggested it).

	1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market
	factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.

	2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without
	full trade automation.

	3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.
 
II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments 
   per project on completion, and   fees per transaction.

	1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of 
	    Enron's participation.

	2. Payment per project would look like consulting fees.

	3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through
	    fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support
	    tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify
	    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.


Recommendations:

	1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.

	2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship
                with UBS.

	3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to Enron from
	    Prediction Company.

Glynn:

Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing 
included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was 
apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is 
nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on 
April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured 
claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and 
state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as 
uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the 
claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the 
court determines the validity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity 
to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several 
reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) 
we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the 
real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as 
significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers 
... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on 
the creditors committee anyway).",Glynn,,Enron CTC PGE PG&E the Creditors' Committee PX ISO

N48875.DTL 
Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of 
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power 
crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share 
of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of 
California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private 
energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the 
state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting 
to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting 
against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and 
simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most 
of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying 
the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators 
who have also gouged California. 
""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across 
their face because they are robbing us blind,"" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state 
Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from 
Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are 
made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually 
used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most 
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and 
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped 
as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events 
that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover 
from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in 
receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, 
an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents 
subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged 
market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, 
received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged 
higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 
million.

i have a slightly different view on your point #4.  the israelis are actually 
pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the 
israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks.  the 
PNA is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more 
access to aquifers under the land.  the isaelis want a desal project for the 
PNA so that they can claim that the PNA has a larger water base, and thus 
does not need to have more land for access to more water.  the issue is that 
there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently 
reach the west bank, thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot 
point in this discussion, although it will not be due to the lack of 
rationale to their discussions.

i think that it is worth pointing out that the US consulate and embassy in 
israel have been helpful to us.  from the macro level, there needs to be more 
proactive cooperation between the PNA and GOI on this project (due to the 
logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below).  furthermore, 
it it worth noting that the PNA need to be more willing to adapt their 
standards to be more in line with large international transactions, as the 
local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome, and will not 
benefit the PNA by attracting large scale foreign investment.

please let me know if you wish to discuss this further.

 I hope this is not too presumptuous, but I'd like to directly advise you of 
my organization within Corporate HR.

 I am the Senior Director of the Office of Labor and Employment Relations 
(formerly known as the Fair Employment and Labor Practices Group).  I joined 
Enron in February after spending 11 years with MCI WorldCom where I was 
Associate Litigation Counsel in Atlanta representing MCI, and then WorldCom, 
in all of their employment law matters in the Southeast.  Before MCI, I 
practiced labor and employment law with two large law firms, including Vinson 
& Elkins here in Houston.  

 As you will note from the attached org chart, there are seven primary 
functions for which my staff and I am responsible.  In summary fashion, they 
are:

1. Executive Programs (i.e., Impact & Influence, Power of Communication, 
Executive Forums, etc.)

2. Resource Management (i.e, Redeployment, New Hire Orientation)

3. Workforce Development (i.e., diversity efforts such as recruitment, 
training, mentoring, succession planning, etc.)

4. Employee Relations (i.e., EEO charges, internal grievance investigations, 
policy review, advice, etc.)

5. Labor Relations (i.e., union awareness, collective bargaining negotiation, 
M&A advice, etc.)

6. Government Programs (i.e., affirmative action plans, gov't reporting 
requirements, gov't audits, etc.)

7. Employment Law Training (i.e., discrimination, sexual harassment, 
performance management, interviewing skills, etc.  -- all from a risk 
management perspective).

 I hope to be able to spend some time with you filling in the details and 
answering any questions you have.  In the meantime, please let me know if 
there is anything I can provide for you.

following entities: members of the Operations Committee (Enron, Atco, Enmax, 
Engage, IPCCAA, IPPSA), SaskPower, Powerex, CalPx, and WattEx.  Dale intends 
to take these rule changes to the Power Pool Council for approval at their 
meeting on Wednesday Nov 15 at 11:00 am.  He said this is part of the ""Pool 
Rule Change"" elements of the 10 point plan released by ADRD on Nov 3.  I 
asked Dale if I should copy any comments we may wish to submit to the ADRD 
and he indicated that would be a good idea.  

We can discuss how to proceed further at our meeting this afternoon.

See highlited section of story below.  PG&E's got it right.  Recall that DWR 
was only buying power that it determined was ""priced reasonably.""  
Consequently, the net short wasn't getting picked up.  That meant that the 
ISO would have to go to the real-time market to close the gap.  The ISO would 
then charge the utilities for the power purchased.  Recall that Bob Glynn 
referenced the $300 MM/month that continued to pile up on PG&E's balance 
sheet as one of the several reasons that PG&E put itself into bankruptcy.  
Now that PG&E's in bankruptcy, the state is now responsible for the full net 
short, and can't continue to sluff it off onto PG&E's balance sheet.  So it's 
therefore no surprise that the State's daily bill for power purchases has

2261,"Once again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity 
legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other 
interested parties including industry segments, public power and state 
regulators.  The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve 
Largent and Chip Pickering.

After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an 
agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an 
electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package 
that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next 
week.  Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the 
discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine 
whether to proceed further.  There is a general perception that committee 
leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in 
the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported 
legislation.

In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained 
over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines.  As the drafts 
progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language 
that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and 
federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action 
in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case.

A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together 
a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the 
understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to 
our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal 
siting.  However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant 
interest groups not willing to go along.  Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to 
link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO.

There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection 
and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the 
details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the 
minimalist package.

There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks 
floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have 
made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market 
rates.  Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others.

As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up 
occurs.  In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and 
other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will 
take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday.  That package will 
have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and 
reformulated gasoline.  Details to follow once legislative language is 
released.","Tom DeLay Steve

CalPX Told To Release Confidential Trade Data To State 
  
09/22/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California's Electricity Oversight Board has 
ordered the state's Power Exchange to hand over confidential information to 
the board regarding the trading activities of utilities, generation companies 
and other market participants who traded power at the exchange since June, 
according to a copy of a subpoena obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. 
The subpoena marks the first time the state will gain access and learn how 
each company traded power in the day-of, day-ahead and block forward markets. 
Moreover, the EOB subpoena requests the CalPX release the names of the 
participants who traded power at the exchange since June to better understand 
how and why the participants conduct business in the various markets at the 
exchange. 
The CalPX has until Wednesday to hand over ""aggregate supply and demand 
curves, individual firm bid dates, final schedules for each firm by 
generating unit, injection point and take out point,"" from June 1 through 
September and continue supplying trading data through Nov. 1. 
In addition, the subpoena requests ""block forward trade positions by firm for 
June, July, August and September"" and that this information continue to be 
supplied through October and November. 
The subpoena is part of the state's ongoing investigation into California's 
troubled deregulated electricity market, which has resulted in high wholesale 
power prices in San Diego, landmark legislative action and accusations of 
collusion, price gouging and market power. Gov. Gray Davis ordered an 
investigation in June, when power prices soared to near record levels and 
rolling blackouts wreaked havoc in the Bay Area. 
The CalPX said it will comply with the EOB request and that a subpoena to 
access the confidential information is required according to the rules of the 
exchange. But the EOB will be required to protect the confidentiality of each 
trade it gains insight into as well as the identities of the participants who 
traded. 
If the trading activities of a company or other participant is leaked or 
becomes public it could have a devastating affect on the company and the EOB 
would be held liable, according to the CalPX. 
The CalPX said it must notify each and every participant who traded power in 
its various markets to alert them of the EOB subpoena.

Enron Offers to Lend $275 Mln to Take Azurix Unit Private

     Houston, Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, offered to provide $275 million in
financing to take Azurix Corp., its struggling water affiliate,
private.
     The proposal would let Azurix buy back shares from private
investors at $7 apiece, a 96 percent premium to yesterday's
closing prices for the Houston-based company, Enron said.
     Azurix would buy back one-third of company. Enron already
owns a third of the water company it created two years ago, and
controls another third through an investor group called Atlantic
Water Trust.
     Azurix shares have fallen more than 80 percent since Enron
took the company public last year as part of a plan to exploit an
expected boom in water treatment projects worldwide.
     Rebecca Mark, once considered in line for the chief
executive's post at Enron, resigned in August as Azurix's chairman
and chief executive because of the company's poor performance.
     Shares of Azurix halted trading at $3.94 on the New York
Stock Exchange today. They've fallen from a high of $23.88 in July
1999. The company now has a market capitalization of $462 million.
    Shares of Houston-based Enron rose 88 cents to $77.38 in early
afternoon trading.

As you requested, the following is a detailed update on pipeline safety 
legislation currently moving through Congress:

Pipeline safety reauthorization legislation

Authorization for pipeline safety programs, as administered by the U.S. Dept. 
of Transportation, Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), is currently set to 
expire at the end of FY 2000.    At the beginning of the 106th Congress, 
industry was focused on securing a simple, two year re-authorization bill 
that basically extends current pipeline safety programs with some modest 
increases in funding levels.  In fact, the House Commerce Committee (who 
shares jurisdiction over pipeline safety with the Transportation & 
Infrastructure Committee) acted early in 1999 to pass a simple, two year 
reauthorization bill (H.R. 1378).

Unfortunately, the issue became more complex from that point.   A serious 
liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham, Washington that occurred last summer, 
killing several children, dramatically changed the debate over pipeline 
safety.   Members of the House and Senate from Washington state (backed by 
the governor and numerous state and local officials) moved swiftly to 
introduce legislation that they feel is designed to address some of the 
shortcomings in federal pipeline regulation that they believe may have 
allowed the Bellingham incident to occur.

In the Senate, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) has introduced S. 2004, which is 
designed to expand State authority over interstate pipelines in several new 
areas, such as inspection and testing, emergency response plans, leak 
detection, and operator training and qualification.   The bill also would 
authorize a large increase in OPS funding through pipeline user fees, to 
increase the amount of grants to the States, allow for hiring of additional 
inspectors, and increase R&D for inspection and leak detection technologies.  
The current OPS budget is around $36 million (with $30 million from user 
fees) -- the Murray bill would authorize $50 million in FY2001, which would 
require a sizeable increase in user fees.  Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) has 
recently decided to co-sposnor the Murray bill, and will be actively involved 
in trying to gain Republican support for the bill.   On the House side, Rep. 
Jack Metcalf (R-WA) has introduced a similar bill, H.R. 3558, which a number 
of the Washington representatives have co-sponsored.

Interstate natural gas pipelines have been placed in a very difficult 
situation.    The Bellingham incident was a liquid pipeline accident, and 
liquids pipelines generally have less stringent regulatory requirements than 
natural gas pipelines.   The Washington delegation has highlighted the fact 
that 280 deaths and 1500 injuries have occurred over the past 14 years 
related to natural gas pipeline incidents, but they fail to distinguish the 
fact that almost all of those incidents were on LDC systems (which 
ironically, are entirely State regulated).  Only 39 fatalities in that period 
were natural-gas related, and the majority of those accidents were caused by 
third party damage.  In short, the INGAA crowd is being dragged down by the 
poor records of the LDCs and the liquid pipelines.    

The calls for more state regulation of interstate pipeline are largely 
misguided, based on the fact that the interstate pipelines under federal 
regulation have an exemplary safety record.   In addition, OPS is already 
working on a ""Pipeline Integrity"" Rulemaking that would implement a number of 
additional measures to prevent accidents on federally-regulated pipelines.

As you mentioned, INGAA has not been doing the best job representing us on 
these issues.  They have been working in a group effort with API, AGA, and 
the Association of Oil Pipelines (AOPL) to try and deflect the negative 
claims of the Murray and Metcalf legislation, but have not been forceful 
enough in distinguishing interstate natural gas pipelines' positive record 
from the liquids and LDCs.  Thus, they have given the impression that INGAA 
companies might be willing to submit to additional regulation that liquids 
and LDC are under political pressure to submit to due to Bellingham.  We have 
been working with other major INGAA companies (El Paso, in particular) to 
make sure that the perspective and positive record of our natural gas 
pipelines is heard clearly by the key legislators.

The odds of these measures (S. 2004, H.R. 3558) passing on their own is 
fairly slim.   They will get a great deal of attention, however.  The Senate 
Commerce Committee held a field hearing in Bellingham, Washington yesterday, 
at which Senators Gorton and Murray testified along with OPS and the families 
of Bellingham victims -- the press coverage was not good (i.e., USA Today 
cover story ""When Pipelines Are Time Bombs"").   These bills (or portions of 
them) will likely be offered and considered as amendments to Pipeline Safety 
Reauthorization legislation as it comes before the House Transportation & 
Infrastructure and Senate Commerce Committee later this year.   

The increased controversy caused by these bills will likely doom efforts to 
pass a pipeline safety reauthorization bill this year.   The leadership of 
the House and Senate Committees will not likely want to face a bitter debate 
between safety advocates, OPS, States, and industry in their committees in 
this tough election year.   While this is probably a good sign, there is an 
increased risk that industry may face some large hurdles in the 
appropriations process.

Appropriations Legislation

While Members of Congress push for their stand alone bills and/or amendments 
to reauthorization bills, the greater danger is that some of these issues 
will be dealt with in an appropriations context.    In particular, the fact 
that Senator Slade Gorton is now actively engaged in pushing for extensive 
pipeline safety reforms is troubling -- he is a key member of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, is close to Republican leadership, and has a tough 
re-election fight coming up.   Senator Murray is also on Senate 
Appropriations.  Both are on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, 
which funds OPS.

It is quite likely that the Senators will make a push to get increases in the 
OPS budget for FY 2001 that would enable the kinds of reforms contemplated by 
their stand-alone legislation (more state funding, more inspectors, more 
R&D).  Much of this increase would be funded through increases in user fees.  
INGAA indicates that it expects we could be facing increases in the range of 
10-15% from FY2000.   There is also the possibility that an attempt will be 
made to add legislative riders to the OPS appropriations -- such as requiring 
OPS to mandate inspections, increase operator qualifications, or allow 
increased state authority.   I would predict that legislative riders can be 
prevented, but it will be very difficult to avoid some kind of increases 
(beyond mere adjustments for inflation) in the OPS budget and user fees.  

The reauthorization will indeed receive attention in 2000, but our advocacy 
efforts will clearly need to be focused on the appropriations process, in 
order to minimize the impact on interstate pipeline user fees and prevent 
other harmful mandates.  

We will continue to work with key members of the authorizing and 
appropriations committees to ensure that the interstate natural gas 
perspective is clearly heard and, if possible, we avoid being dragged down in 
attempts to impose more strict regulation on liquids and LDCs.

 We had a good meeting with OPIC last week.  They are sympathetic to our 
situation and inclined to support the PNT, with certain particular concerns 
stemming from the fact they are a government agency, as I am sure you have 
been briefed.  But an issue they raised - how do we plan to proceed so as to 
get the Indian players to the table as we move to issuance of PNT - is a 
critical one now to ponder as we ratchet up the signals through the legal 
steps we are taking.
 If I might, some thoughts on this process, and I hope they help your 
thinking.

  1.  My conversations with the Embassy last week indicate that they 
understand the message we are sending and are eager to get into a dialogue 
beyond the discussions with Wade about the invocation of the counter 
guarantee for each month's payment.  That is one reason they are eager to set 
up a meeting with Ken for the 27th with the Finance Minister. The Ambassador, 
I think reflecting a view of the Centre, was seeking assurances that we were 
not going to leave the country but remain engaged with them in seeking a 
""typically convoluted Indian solution to the problem"" (His words).  I think 
at very senior levels the government does not want to be left having to sort 
out the solution themselves, while also bearing the international political 
ramifications of the departure of a major American investor.
       So I think the Centre wants now to engage with us in a dialogue to 
find a solution.  But I think they do not know quite where we stand at this 
point and whether we want to talk.  The legal steps certainly can point to an 
intent to leave, and I think the Indians now need a signal from us - 
preferably in private.
 2.  The Centre also does not genuinely know how to solve the problem.  So I 
think we need to have ready a proposal that can serve as the basis for 
concrete discussions, and that we not give up a lot in the process.  But we 
need to convey to the Centre that we have concrete ideas for solving the 
problem.
 3.   There needs to be a political communication path between Delhi and 
Houston that parallels the legal/payment communication path Wade is so ably 
handling.  The Centre cannot differentiate the roles Wade is handling so I 
think they undervalue the more political messages.  They are looking for Ken 
and yourself to handle the higher level communications, or an agent directly 
representing you to do so.  Only such a person will be able to meet with the 
Finance Minister at the end of the month.  I understand Prabu is viewed as 
competent technically but not a power within the BJP, so a decision on 
negotiations will not be his.  The critical player at this point is Jashwant 
Singh, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defense and now also overseeing the 
Prime Minister's Office.  Sinha, the Finance Minister, will be more reluctant 
to engage on our issue because its politics are not in his realm - except for 
the finance issues.  But the timing of his visit and willingness to meet are 
positive to moving the dialogue forward.      
 4.  The GOM is the real problem.  The Embassy made some interesting comments 
about this issue.  It noted that we had not really called upon the support of 
the USG to date, and then, without directly saying so,  encouraged us to get 
the President and his Administration to weigh in.  The objective, I think, is 
to provide ammunition for the Prime Minister to call Deshmuck in and direct 
him to negotiate in the national interest.  We also need to underscore to the 
Centre that we have a window and that negotiations need to go forward now 
before we get boxed into our respective corners.

I hope this helps. Thanks John  ","Rebecca Wade Ken Ken

          offer network service, flexible point-to-point service, or non-

          firm service.  Thus, it did not provide customers with the same

          flexibility that AEP itself has.  Nor did it provide a service

          priority equivalent to that enjoyed by native load.  The

          Commission set AEP's tariff for hearing and, on rehearing, held

          that in order not to be unduly discriminatory, the tariff had to

          offer comparable service.  American Electric Power Service Corp.,

          alleged discriminatory practices. 1/  AMP-Ohio is an

          association of municipalities in Ohio, some of whose members

          depend on AEP for transmission and partial requirements service.=
=20

          IMPA is an association of municipalities in Indiana, and many of

          IMPA's loads are captive to the AEP transmission system.  The

          witnesses alleged as follows:=20

                    1.  In anticipation of high peak demands, AEP would

               contract for large blocks of available short-term power,

               withhold sale of short-term power, refuse to transmit third

               party short-term power, and require purchases from AEP at

               the emergency rate (100 mill/kwh) when an emergency might

               not exist.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 6.

                    2.  In December 1989, AMP-Ohio negotiated a 20 MW

               purchase of short-term power from Louisville Gas & Electric

               Company (LG&E).  AEP refused to wheel because LG&E had

               earlier that day told AEP it had no power to sell to AEP.=20

               AEP then bought the power from LG&E and offered to resell it

               to AMP-Ohio.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 6-7.

                    3.  In January 1990, AMP-Ohio solicited bids for

               February power purchases from a number of utilities

               including AEP.  AEP was not the winning bid.  AMP-Ohio made

               arrangements to purchase the power from four winning bidders

               and sought transmission through AEP.  When AMP-Ohio gave AEP
                             =20

          1/   After the Rehearing Order expanding the scope of the
               proceeding, AMP-Ohio and IMPA withdrew this testimony as no
               longer necessary.  This withdrawal does not change the fact
               that the testimony was sworn to under oath.

               the schedule for delivery, AEP refused to transmit the

               power, matched the average price of the winning bids, and

               made the sale itself.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 7.

                    4.  In August 1993, an AMP-Ohio member (Columbus, Ohio)

               was purchasing 10 MW of hourly non-displacement power from

               AEP and, after AEP raised its price to 60 mills/kwh, sought

               another source for the next hour.  Consumers Power Company

               and Detroit Edison Company both offered non-displacement

               power at 40 mills.  AEP refused to transmit, saying it had a

               600 MW unit out and could not resell power from another

               source. 2/  Columbus cancelled the transaction and had to

               buy 10 MW of power from AEP at 100 mills/kwh.  Ex. AMPO-1 at

               7-8.

                    5.  In July 1993, two AMP-Ohio members (Columbus and

               St. Mary's) had been buying hourly non-displacement power

               from AEP when the price rose to 35 mills.  Dayton Power &

               Light Company (DP&L) offered to sell at 23 mills and AEP

               agreed to transmit for one hour.  But for the next hour, AEP

               said it had problems with its system, refused to transmit

               the power, kept the power from DP&L for itself and offered

               to sell power to AMP-Ohio for Columbus and St. Mary's at 100
                             =20

          2/   AEP generally limited its offer of short-term transmission
               to buy/sell transactions; that is, AEP would buy the power
               from the seller and resell it to the purchaser.=20
               Supplemental testimony of AEP Witness Baker (Ex. A-73) at
               27-29.  Often, the terms of the buy/sell transaction
               required transmission dependent utilities (TDUs) to maintain
               reserves and meet contractual commitments for at least a
               year.  Id.   =20

               mills.  Columbus increased its local generation, but St.

               Mary's purchased 8 MW at 100 mills.  For the next hour, AMP-

               Ohio arranged with DP&L for another 8 MW, hoping AEP would

               transmit under the 24 hour buy-sell agreement.  AEP did

               transmit this power.  Seven hours later in the day, St.

               Mary's Greenup Hydro project power was available and the 8

               MW from DP&L was no longer needed.  If St. Mary's had been

               receiving the hourly power that AEP had refused to transmit,

               St. Mary's could have switched to Greenup power.  But

               because AMP-Ohio had changed to daily service, St. Mary's

               had to pay a demand charge for the entire day, even though

               it used the power only 7 hours and would have paid less

               under the hourly rate.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 8-9.=20

                    6.  In January 1994, AMP-Ohio sought to transfer power

               from one member with generation to other members, which

               required transmission over AEP and Toledo Edison lines.=20

               Toledo Edison said yes, AEP said no.  AMP-Ohio's northern

               members purchased emergency power from Toledo Edison.  AMP-

               Ohio then reminded AEP that it had agreed not to deny

               transmission and AEP agreed to transmit.  Ex. AMPO-1 at 9. =
=20

                    7.  IMPA arranged to buy 80 MW of short-term power from

               LG&E and have it wheeled, using buy-sell arrangements,

               through Public Service Company of Indiana (PSI) and AEP to

               serve IMPA's load at Richmond (an IMPA member).  The

               delivered price was $.292 per kW-day plus a 1 mill adder.=20

               At the same time AEP arranged to buy 300 MW from PSI at $.30
=0F,






                                        - 5 -


               per kW day plus out-of-pocket energy costs.  Hence, PSI was

               shipping a total of 380 MW to AEP with 80 MW of that amount

               to be delivered to IMPA's load at Richmond.  Then, on a day

               when IMPA should have received the 80 MW, AEP told IMPA that

               PSI had sold everything to AEP and that IMPA would have to

               buy from AEP at $.63 per kW day plus the cost of energy from

               AEP.  IMPA purchased from AEP under protest.  AEP used its

               control over transmission to intercept the 80 MW at a lower

               price and resell it as short-term power to IMPA.  AEP

               claimed that PSI had terminated its sales to AEP on that

               day.  But the 80 MW was independent of PSI's other sales to

               AEP and would not have been interrupted if AEP had not

               interrupted it.  IMPA-1 at 7.

                    8.  IMPA has combustion turbines owned by and located

               at one member, which IMPA would like to connect to the Joint

               Transmission System owned by IMPA, CINergy and Wabash Valley

               Power Association.  To do so, IMPA needed a metering

               agreement with AEP, to which AEP would not agree.  IMPA-1 at

               6.

                    9.  In January 1994, IMPA had power to sell from its

               turbines when AEP and others needed power.  IMPA offered

               power to AEP but AEP it said could not purchase the power

               without an existing contract.  Moreover, since there was no

               short-term tariff, IMPA could not sell the power to another

               utility.  IMPA-1 at 6. =20

               dilatory tactics that raised the customer's transaction

               costs and effectively denied transmission is the ""sham

               transaction"" provision proposed by AEP.  As filed, AEP's

               tariffs permitted it to deny service merely because a

               portion of the transmitted power might be used to serve a

               former retail customer of AEP.  See, e.g., Ex. BR&WVP-1 (J.

               Bertram Solomon testimony, February 23, 1994).  (As part of

               a settlement AEP filed the pro forma tariff and withdrew

               this provision.)=20

                    11.  Finally, AEP's originally filed tariff contained a

               ""prodigal customer"" provision.  Under this provision,

               transmission customers who sought to convert back to

               requirements service had to give AEP five years' notice, in

               which case AEP and the customer would enter into

               negotiations to determine whether AEP will provide service

               at all and if so under what rate, terms, and conditions.=20

               Ex. S-39 at 1 (Staff testimony).  AEP did not require notice

               from all new customers, only from prodigal customers.  Id.

               at 2.  That a potential customer was previously served by

               AEP is not a reason to treat the customer differently.  (AEP

               withdrew this provision when it filed the pro forma tariff.)

                    B.  Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy)=20

               Entergy filed a partial settlement largely adopting the NOPR

          pro forma tariffs except for two provisions (headroom and

          ancillary services).  Because the settlement predated the filing

          date for customer testimony before the ALJ, the customers did not

                                        - 7 -


          address the need for Entergy to file a tariff.  However,

          customers did make allegations of discriminatory practices, as

          follows.    =20

                    1.  Customers alleged that Entergy flat-out refused to

               wheel.  Louisiana Energy and Power Authority (LEPA) witness

               Sylvan J. Richard testified that LEPA's predecessor systems

               could not obtain interconnections from Entergy.  Ex. SJR-1

               at 50.

                    2.  Customers also alleged that Entergy refused to

               provide service priority equal to native load and refused to

               provide service flexibility equivalent to the utility's own

               use.  For example, LEPA witness Richard testified that even

               after state commissions ordered interconnections and other

               coordination services, LEPA's predecessors were still not

               able to obtain coordination services because Entergy was not

               willing to coordinate and because the transmission service

               it did offer was inflexible, unidirectional point-to-point

               service, which prevented economic coordination with others.=

                    3.  South Mississippi Electric Power Association

               (SMEPA) witness J. Bertram Solomon testified that Entergy's

               original ""open access"" tariff was restricted to point-to-

               point service, proposed separate charges for each operating

               company, and required the cancellation of existing

               agreements in order to take service under the proposed

               tariff.  Ex. SMEPA-10 at 28.  Entergy eventually filed a
=0F,






                                        - 8 -


               network tariff, but proposed different local facilities

               charges for the various Entergy public utility operating

               subsidiaries.  Id. at 29.  Since these local facilities

               charges were higher than the transmission component of the

               subsidiaries' bundled rates, Entergy obtained a competitive

               advantage.  Id.

                    4.  The Arkansas Cities and Cooperatives (ACC) is a

               group of cities and cooperatives that own or operate

               electric generation or distribution systems in Arkansas.=20

               ACC Witness Steven Merchant testified that Entergy has

               segregated the wholesale market between two of its

               subsidiaries, Arkansas Power & Light Copmpany (APL) and

               Entergy Power, Inc. (EPI).  Ex. SMM-1 at 16.  In marketing

               power and energy in Arkansas, EPI is subject to an Arkansas

               Commission order that bars EPI from competing with APL for

               wholesale loads without first obtaining a waiver.  Id.=20

               Recently, EPI requested this waiver for all wholesale

               transactions in Arkansas except for wholesale customers

               currently served by an Entergy subsidiary; in other words,

               EPI requested the Arkansas Commission to expand competition

               for all wholesale customers except where EPI might compete

               with APL.  Id.  ACC witness Merchant concluded that, since

               EPI does not compete with APL, Entergy insulates APL's

               wholesale business from competition and denies those

               wholesale customers access to EPI as a source of power,

               thereby limiting alternative generation sources available to

               ACC.  Id. at 17-19.  (Entergy's witness Kenney stated that

               Entergy has recently filed a joint motion with ACC to the

               Arkansas Commission seeking to extend the waiver and permit

               EPI to sell to APL's wholesale customers.  Ex. JFK-11 at 14-

               15.)

               C.  Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E)

               Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) attached several

          documents to its 1988 complaint in Docket No. EL89-4.  These

          documents were provided to support NCPA's claim that PG&E's

          unreasonable practices under the PG&E/NCPA Interconnection

          Agreement (IA) effectively denied NCPA access to transmission

          properly requested under the IA.  Although the parties eventually

          settled and the Commission terminated the docket with a letter

          order dated May 18, 1988, these documents provide allegations of

          PG&E using dilatory tactics that so protracted negotiations as to

          effectively equal a refusal to wheel. 3/      =20

                    1.  PG&E stated that since transmission was not

               currently available, it was entitled to wait 72 months

               before providing transmission; that is, transmission access

               could not be granted before the passing of the 72-month

               notice period.  NCPA 1988 Complaint, Ex. 3.  However, the IA
                             =20

          3/   All of these incidents are related to and examples of PG&E's
               conduct described in the NOPR (FERC Stats. & Regs. =0F4 32,5=

               at 33,073 n.151), that is, the history of PG&E's attempt to
               avoid its commitments made to the California owners of the
               California Oregon Transmission Project (COTP).  However,
               these incidents are not exactly the same as the incidents
               described in the NOPR, because NCPA is not one of the owners
               of the COTP.

               provided that transmission be provided when it becomes

               actually available.  PG&E also requested substantial

               additional information, which NCPA considered beyond that

               reasonably necessary for a study, but still provided.  PG&E

               then determined that transmission was not available,

               reasoning that transmission was unavailable unless all the

               transmission requested could be provided 8760 hours per year

               without restrictions or limitations, extending through the

               expiration of the agreement in 2013.  NCPA 1988 Complaint at

               January 28, 1988, PG&E filed an interconnection agreement

               D.  Northeast Utilities Service Company (NU)

               This is the case where Northeast Utilities acquired Public

          Service of New Hampshire (PSNH) (Docket No. EC90-10).  New

          England Power Company (NEP) witness Robert Bigelow's direct

          testimony expressed concern over the ""relatively restrictive

          transmission policies of both"" NU, on behalf of Northeast

          Utilities' public utility subsidiaries, and PSNH.  Bigelow Direct

          Testimony at 21 (filed May 25, 1990).  In his cross rebuttal

          testimony, Mr. Bigelow testified that ""NU has a poor track record

          as a provider of transmission service"" and ""PSNH also has an

          abhorrent track record as a provider of transmission services.""=

          Bigelow Cross Rebuttal Testimony, at 3 (filed June 20, 1990).=20

          Mr. Bigelow described both NU's and NEP's (his own company)

          failure to provide service flexibility equivalent to their own

          use.  Except for NEP's TDUs, both NEP and NU historically

          provided only point-to-point transmission, which required

          separate scheduling for each transaction.  Bigelow Cross Rebuttal

          instances of Edison's conduct.  Richard Greenwalt was the power

          supply supervisor for the City of Riverside, California.  He was

          responsible for scheduling all purchases of energy for Riverside

          and for the cities of Azusa, Banning and Colton, California.=20

          Greenwalt testimony at 1 (November 1989).  (These four cities and

          Anaheim, California, are collectively referred to as the Southern

          Cities or Cities.)  Joseph Hsu was the Director of Utilities for

          Azusa.  Hsu testimony at 1 (November 1989).  Gale Drews was the

          electric utility director of Colton.  Drews testimony at 1-2

          general manager of the Anaheim power department.  Hoyt testimony

          at 1 (November 1989).  Dan McCann was the power coordination

          supervisor for Anaheim.  He supervised Anaheim's load scheduling

          and is a former Edison employee, having worked for Edison for 20

          years.  McCann Testimony at 1-2 (November 1989).  These witnesses

          testified that Edison refused to wheel as follows.

                    1.  Edison's policy was to curtail the Cities any time

               it could be justified using any of a list of acceptable

               reasons to deny interruptible transmission service.  Id. at

               22-23.=20

                    2.  Edison would not generally provide transmission

               service when Edison could save money by itself purchasing

               the economy energy that would be wheeled.  McCann testimony

               at 19.  The Cities called Edison every hour to request

               interruptible transmission service.  Id..  Edison often

               refused to sell energy available in the Western Systems

               Power Pool to the Cities and then made available higher cost

               contract energy or partial requirements service.  Id. at 19-

               20. =20

                    3.  When Anaheim requested Edison provide firm

               transmission of power from neighboring states, Edison would

               often agree to provide non-firm service but would not

               integrate the capacity for many years in the future, saying

               that its control area did not need capacity at that time.=20

               Hoyt testimony at 9.  Since the selling utility was

               interested in a sale of capacity, not just energy, the

               transaction would not occur.  Id.  Edison repeatedly used

               its control over transmission to deny Anaheim access to low-

               cost firm power.  Id. at 9-10. =20

                    4.  While Edison provided short-term firm transmission

               service to the Cities, it would only provide long-term firm

               service for three specific resources:  the SONGS nuclear

               plant, a specific IPP, and Hoover Dam power.  Hoyt testimony

               at 20.  One of Edison's reasons for denying long-term

               transmission was that Edison desired to reserve the

               transmission for its own future (unspecified) needs.  Id. =

                    8.  Riverside requested transmission from Palo Verde

               and was told that such service was not available.  Carnahan

               testimony at 16.  Edison offered Riverside only 12 MW of

               curtailable transmission entitlement to provide Riverside's

               share of Palo Verde.  Id.  This service was neither large

                    enough or long enough, and Edison insisted on

                    unreasonable terms and conditions.  Id.

                    9.  Azusa, Banning and Colton had a contract with

               Edison that entitled them to use their Palo Verde firm

               transmission path to schedule energy to meet their contract

               energy obligation.  Edison refused to permit the three

               cities to use that path.  Edison did not contest that the

               contracts allowed this use, but said that the scheduling of

               such small amounts of energy for the three cities would be

               too burdensome.  Greenwalt testimony at 14.=20

                    10.  Edison would not respond in a timely manner to the

               Cities' requests, routinely taking months to respond.  Drews

               testimony at 15.

                    11.  During the 1980s, Edison provided Colton with some

               transmission service to allow the Cities to reach certain

               suppliers, but limited the choices available to the Cities

               and imposed terms and conditions that increased the Cities'

               costs and placed Colton at a disadvantage against Edison.=20

               Drews testimony at 9.  Arranging alternative generation

               sources was difficult because the Cities always had to first

               get Edison to state whether it would provide transmission.=
=20

                    12.  During 1988 and 1989, a dispute arose between

               Edison and the Cities concerning the Hoover Uprating

               Project.  Drews testimony at 16.  Edison argued that for the

               months when units were out of service for uprating, and

               Southern Cities capacity was reduced to zero, Southern

               Cities would not receive an energy credit, even though

               energy was still available and used by Edison.  But the

               contracts allowed a participant who did not have capacity to

               still schedule its energy as non-firm energy on the capacity

               of another participant.  Id. at 16-17.

                    13.  In 1986, Azusa negotiated a power purchase

               contract with the California Department of Water Resources

               in increments of first 5 MW and then 2 MW (for a total of 7

               MW).  Hsu testimony at 14.  First Edison assured Azusa that

               the transmission for the additional 2 MW would not be a

               problem.  Id.  Then Edison would not agree to amend the

               transmission service agreement for the additional 2 MW.  Id.
=0F,

                    14.  In 1986, Azusa notified Edison of Special

               Condition 12 4/ purchases from PG&E and requested firm

               transmission service.  Id.  Two months before service was to

               begin, Edison notified the Cities of a problem with the

               transmission lines.  Id.  Transmission was eventually

               granted, but only after a four-month delay and substantial

               losses to the Cities.  Id.  Then Edison decided there was no

               problem with its transmission facilities.  Id. at 14-15.

                    15.  In 1986-87, the Cities purchased 20 MW from PG&E

               and 80 MW from Deseret G&T Cooperative.  Hoyt testimony at

               7-8.  Edison stated that without reinforcement of its

               transmission system, Edison would not provide the

               transmission.  Id.  There was a five-month delay during

               which the Cities were forced to purchase from Edison at a

               higher cost.  Id. at 8-9.  Then Edison decided that the

               transmission system did not need reinforcement.  Id. at 8.

                    16.  Edison also refused to provide a service priority

               equal to that of native load.  It would curtail the Cities

               in order to purchase more economy energy for itself.  McCann

               testimony at 28.  If Edison could make the purchase, it

               would curtail the City and use the energy for itself.  Id.=

               When Edison curtailed the Cities, they were not able to

          4/   Special Condition 12 of the Integrated Operations Agreement
               between Edison and the Southern Cities defined certain
               Special Condition 12 resources and allowed the Cities to
               make certain uses of those resources, subject to certain
               restrictions.=20
=0F,

               purchase economy energy and instead purchased energy from

               Edison.  Id. at 24.

                    17.  According to Edison, the interruptible

               transmission it provided the Cities was interruptible for

               any reason.  Id. at 20.  A purchase could be terminated the

               hour after it is begun or even during the hour.  Id.  As a

               result, the Cities lost opportunities to make advantageous

               economy purchases.  Id. at 20-21. =20

                    18.  Edison also refused to provide customers

               flexibility similar to the flexibility Edison provided

               itself.  Edison's refusal to provide bi-directional

               transmission service restricted the Cities' abilities to

               purchase hydroelectric energy from the Pacific Northwest.=20

               Hoyt testimony at 22.  Because most contracts with Northwest

               utilities require a return of power, the Northwest utilities

               would not deal with the Cities without transmission to

               return energy.  Id. at 22-23.  Edison did provide bi-

               directional transmission to the Los Angeles Department of

               Water & Power (LADWP) to accommodate flows to and from

               Arizona.  Id.

                    19.  Riverside was unable to obtain non-firm service

               more than two hours in advance of need.  Carnahan testimony

               at 18.

                    20.  Riverside and Colton were both served out of

               Edison's Vista substation.  Although the two cities were on

               the same 69 kV bus, Edison would not allow them to sell

               energy to each other.  Greenwalt testimony at 17.=20

                    21.  Riverside's agreement with Edison allowed

               Riverside to purchase a block of energy through the WSPP and

               divide it up among the four Cities (Azusa, Banning, Colton

               and Riverside).  Greenwalt testimony at 17.  When Riverside

               had excess energy from other sources, Edison would not

               permit it to sell that energy to the other three cities.=20

               Id.  For example, Riverside attempted to sell Deseret energy

               transmitted by LADWP to the Edison system.  Id. at 17-18.=20

               LADWP would not break out the Cities' shares of that energy,

               and Edison would not accept the energy as a delivery for all

               four cities.  Id. at 18.  Edison argued that because this

               energy was excess energy that Riverside could not use,

               Riverside did not have transmission rights to bring it into

               the control area.  Id.  As a result, Riverside paid for the

               energy delivered by LADWP to the Edison control area, but

               could not sell it to the other three cities, and gave it to

               Edison itself, which consumed the energy without making any

               payment for it.  Id.  Riverside tried a number of

               alternative paths, including using WSPP transmission where

               Riverside paid Edison 5 mills to connect to Azusa, 5 mills

               to connect to Banning, and 5 mills to connect to Colton for

               each megawatthour.  While this approach was successful for a

               while, eventually Edison refused to permit these sales. =20

                    22.  Edison claimed that the Cities only have

               transmission rights to bring in enough Special Condition 12
=0F,






                                        - 19 -


               energy to satisfy the Cities' load.  Greenwalt testimony at

               18. =20

                    23.  Edison contended that the Cities' load

               requirements were satisfied first by integrated resources

               and then by Special Condition 12 and economy energy

               purchases.  Id. at 19.  When the Cities' integrated

               resources exceeded their load, any Special Condition 12

               resources became excess.  Under Riverside's Deseret

               contract, the Cities were required to take a minimum of 35

               MW each hour.  Id.  Edison acknowledged that it was

               obligated to buy, or allow the Cities to sell, any excess

               energy from Riverside's integrated resources.  Id.  However,

               Edison refused to give the Cities credit for excess Special

               Condition 12 energy brought into the area, claiming that the

               Cities could not have brought it in because they did not

               have transmission rights.  Id. =20

          II.  Other Examples of Transmission Disputes

               Disputes over transmission are not uncommon, contrary to

          EEI's suggestion.  Some recent examples taken from pleadings and

          other documents and from Commission orders reveal that it has

          been very difficult for various entities in the electric power

          industry to agree on transmission rights.  These examples also

          reveal that even after issuance of AEP and the Open Access NOPR

          with its proposed pro forma tariffs, there has been considerable

          controversy over whether various utilities' ""open access"" tariffs

          deviate from those tariffs.  (The Commission has allowed
=0F,






                                        - 20 -


          utilities that adopt tariffs that match or exceed the non-rate

          terms and conditions in the NOPR pro forma tariffs to obtain

          certain benefits.)

                    A.  In a letter of February 3, 1995 to Mr. Gerald

               Richman of the Commission's Enforcement section in the

               Office of the General Counsel, Steven J. Kean, Vice

               President, Regulatory Affairs, Enron Power Marketing, Inc.

               (Enron) alleged that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NiMo)

               refused to wheel power from Rochester Gas & Electric (RG&E)

               to Enron under RG&E's transmission contract with NiMo;

               however, when Enron revealed the buyer, NiMo did wheel power

               for RG&E to the buyer.  Mr. Kean alleged that this was not

               an isolated incident.  NiMo argued that the contract did not

               require it to provide RG&E with transmission to Enron.  It

               also said that the principle of comparability does not

               require the service.  Letter of November 21, 1994 from NiMo

               representative A. Karen Hill to Gerald Richman.

                    B.  The Commission's Task Force Hot Line (Hot

               Line) received a complaint that a member of the New

               York Power Pool (NYPP) refused to transmit power that

               another member bought from a power marketer.  In a

               letter of November 17, 1994, from Chair Moler to Mr.

               William J. Balet, Executive Director of NYPP, Chair

               Moler explained that the Commission's enforcement staff

               had investigated and found the allegation to be true.

               The Commission found that NSP had misinterpreted the

               contract in several ways.  For, example, SMMPA argued

               that it should be able to directly schedule its

               deliveries of energy out of the NSP control area and

               that it should not be limited to particular points of

               delivery.  NSP argued that only it was entitled to

               control the physical operation of scheduling.  The

               Commission found that the clear language of the

               contracts gave SMMPA the authority to schedule its own

               power. =20

               be less burdensome ways of setting up membership criteria

               for non-traditional entities.

2307,"I've done some research in relation to securing a 1-800 # for Project Summer 
and the following steps will need to be taken if we decide to move forward 
with this:

We must establish where the 1-800 # is going to ring.  For example, it must 
ring through at an assigned 5  digit extension (i.e. similar to all internal 
Enron extensions) that the Enron Move Team will have to create (1 day).

AT&T must be informed of the designated extension # to set up the 1-800 # and 
to electronically route the 1-800 # to that point (typically 10-14 days BUT 
they do offer 1-800 #s for emergencies - i.e. disaster areas - which they can 
set up in 2-3 days).  If we do move forward, I imagine that we will request 
this 2-3 day set up service, since we have already past meeting the 10-14 day 
deadline).

Our internal telephone department must be informed of how many tiers we would 
like on the system for the correct software to be written - this will take 
2-3 days.  For example, I believe we would like callers to have language 
options and business unit options - tier one, may sound as follows: ""You have 
reached....press 1 for CALME, press 2 for APACHI, etc.""  Then the second tier 
may sound as follows: ""...press 1 for Spanish, press 2 for Portugese, etc.""

Will we need to recruit staff internally, who represent the required spectrum 
of languages, to listen to the voice mail messages and email the questions to 
the appropriate business unit PR contact for responses?

Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California
 Utilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations 
swelled and few new energy sources were developed. Now, also facing 
blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and 
toward themselves.


By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer


     WINTERSBURG, Ariz.--For more than a century, California ran a simple 
account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most 
especially water and power.
     But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade--in no small 
part because of an outbound trek of Californians--this simple, supply-demand 
relationship has broken down.
     Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system 
just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same 
way--by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation.
     Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have 
been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face 
the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden 
State.
     The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that 
its planning reserves--the extra power that utilities build in to handle 
emergencies--have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts 
consider dangerous.
     Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production 
at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. 
Despite the long economic boom of the 1990s, which smiled especially on the 
West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power 
plant.
     ""We don't know how bad it's going to be yet,"" said Utah's Republican 
governor, Mike Leavitt. ""We won't know that until May, June, July and August, 
when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers.""
     In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking 
to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic 
deal with California. They want to end an old relationship--that between 
center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized--and establish a new one that 
could curtail California's long regional dominance.
     In the strange chemistry of the moment--when a once-Republican state 
government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government 
has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately 
owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water--they could actually 
meet with some success.
     ""California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street 
and the East,"" said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a 
multivolume history of California. ""Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic 
possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the 
West.""

     Captive Plants Feed Power to California
     Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry 
scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, 
now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well 
to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will 
produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor.
     Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of 
regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California 
once maintained with the rest of the West.
     More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal 
utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities 
and Southern California Edison.
     A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a 
transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a 
half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New 
Mexico.
     From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been 
that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state 
pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home.
     And at least until the mid-1990s, California regulators virtually 
guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if 
plants' power wasn't immediately needed.
     ""The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to 
meet demand, no matter what,"" said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility 
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
     ""If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was 
less important than being sure you could meet demand."" And, he added, ""you 
had regulators watching to make sure you did.""
     The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also 
representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. 
Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same 
California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different 
business premise: selling power to the highest bidder.
     In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an 
electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge 
transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out 
from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to 
Utah and from there to the Northwest.
     All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they 
are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar 
by sending power wherever prices are highest.
     ""It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the 
market to see if they could meet demand,"" said Jack Davis, president of 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is 
putting up two of the Wintersburg plants.
     ""Now,"" he said approvingly, ""it's being built by people who look at the 
market to see if you can make a lot of money.""

     Plans Go Awry in Many States
     Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to 
assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would 
cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of 
new power plants got built.
     If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who 
suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, 
more plants and, ultimately, more power.
     But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned--and 
not just in California, but in the West in general.
     Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, 
including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions 
blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs.
     Its population grew by 40% from 1990 to 2000, according to the Census 
Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, 
according to industry figures.
     ""Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven,"" said A. Michael 
Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent 
Washington-area consulting firm.
     But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 1990s, mostly 
as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had 
applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s.
     ""I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort 
of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon,"" Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull 
said in a recent interview. ""I think what we all worry about is: Are they 
planning?""
     Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased 
electricity-making capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44%. But 
that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 
66%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy 
company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state.
     Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major 
utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously 
planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then 
some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to 
handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital.
     But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional 
supplies are balanced on a ""razor's edge,"" according to Northwest Power Pool 
President Jerry Rust. ""We have no cushion.""
     Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a 
razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this 
summer.
     Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region 
will come up 6% short. ""Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling 
blackouts, most of them in California,"" he said.
     One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in 
contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just 
recently.
     They have been perilously tight for the last several years--before the 
start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the 
near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water 
for its hydroelectric dams.
     The implication is that California did not cause other states to run 
short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did 
that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver.
     When California required its major utilities to buy power in the 
volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along 
higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral.
     That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security 
blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively 
if local supplies proved inadequate.
     The result has been a string of crises across the West.
     In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a 
tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by 
dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the 
spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 300%. Most of the 
project's 13,300 poor customers say they can't pay.
     In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was 
rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 
50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable 
generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market.
     In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip 
planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps 
back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than 
purchasing power on the open market--and the potato farmers are likely to do 
pretty well themselves.

     Deep Hostility in Rest of the West
     The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and 
actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current 
atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the 
West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big 
neighbor, they are less guarded at home.
     The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as 
warning a Salt Lake City audience that ""California, if given the chance, 
would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly."" (In an 
interview, he denied having made the remark.)
     Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners 
that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, ""plundered 
provinces""--terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have 
regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power.
     But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. ""A 
lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with 
California to their advantage,"" said Stanford historian Richard White.
     The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West.
     In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling 
their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, 
federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that 
is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. 
     ""The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the 
region can be exported without the region's consent,"" Oregon Gov. John 
Kitzhaber said in an interview.
     In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new 
power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the 
construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are 
considering another eight.
     Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's 
needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for 
whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California 
just one among many bidders.
     (Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to 
President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic 
California.)
     Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, 
where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst 
nightmare--recalling power that Utah produces for the state.
     Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own 
three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in 
west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years.
     But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in 
their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with 
proper notice, to recall power for local use.
     The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 
megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, 
and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general 
manager Reed Searle.
     Although the amounts are trivial--the Los Angeles utility either owns or 
has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity--Leavitt said 
Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants 
in the state, including a 500- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is 
negotiating to build.
     ""California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has 
depended on us to do that,"" the Utah governor said. ""That's fine and we're 
willing to do that.
     ""But,"" he added, ""there comes a point at which, if demand grows too 
large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for 
our children and grandchildren.""
     If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California 
could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which 
it now suffers.

The proposal that ENA submitted to Peevey/Freeman includes a proposal to 
reduce demand by 400 MWs if the state implements financial incentives for 
such reductions (i.e., if the state is willing to pay, say, 7 cents/kwh to 
""produce,"" it ought to willing to pay 7 cents to ""reduce."")  That proposal 
was distributed to the usual, company wide email distribution list last week 
when it was submitted.  We can discuss further on the phone call this morning.

California Utilities' LossesOn Electricity Pose Risk

By REBECCA SMITH

Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

California's two biggest utilities are losing so much
money buying electricity in the state's deregulated
market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half
their net worth in just four months.

If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the
price these utilities are allowed to bill their
customers, as currently seems likely, they could become
technically insolvent sometime next year. That would put
pressure on regulators to orchestrate a
multibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the ""too
big to fail'' response that in the past pushed
governments to rescue banks.

Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-rating
concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for
Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based
PG&E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit of
Edison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- rating
concerns say they aren't sure how much additional debt
can be borne by the two affected utilities before they
will have difficulty paying their bills.

Probe of California Power Prices Begins, but New Plants
Aren't Seen as Solution (Sept. 11)

Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting, Surprisingly, From
Deregulation (Sept. 6)

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs
(Sept. 1)
""If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities can
get through it,"" says Lori Woodland, analyst for Fitch
IBCA. ""If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a very
serious situation."" Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior credit
officer at Moody's Investors Service Inc.: ""At some
point, you have a financial crisis.""

The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting
expenses and don't envision problems in servicing their
debts. But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal
regulators to change the rules of the game, hoping
somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall. The
California utilities' experience may be a harbinger of
what could happen in other states where wholesale power
prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are
allowed to charge their ratepayers.

For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to the
financial markets to borrow money. PG&E, a giant utility
that serves one out of every 20 Americans, is seeking
approval to increase its debt capacity by $1.4 billion.
It is borrowing $200 million, while Edison is tapping
$250 million from the commercial paper market. ""This is
going to be a long, tough road,"" says Jim Scilacci, chief
financial officer for Southern California Edison.

Today's situation represents a complete turnabout from
what was expected when California deregulated its energy
market on March 31, 1998, which opened electricity
pricing to competition. California tried to give its
utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating
faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to
allow investor-owned utilities, such as PG&E and Edison,
to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers
under the old regulatory system.

To do this, the state legislature set retail rates at
high levels, which, at first, generated fat surpluses for
the utilities. As the money piled up, utilities used it
to pay down debts for generation facilities that were
otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world. By
the end of this June, PG&E and Edison together had
collected more than $12 billion and were on track to
finish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31,
2002, deadline set by the legislature. At that point,
rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to
fluctuate with the market.

But all that went out the window in June, when wholesale
power prices surged, topping the rates the utilities were
allowed to charge retail customers. Average prices at
state-sanctioned energy markets were four to five times
the prices of a year earlier, and three to four times the
level utilities could charge customers.

The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&E,
that analysts expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion by
Oct. 31, more than half its shareholder equity of $5.7
billion, which is defined as assets minus liabilities.
Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit
of $2 billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its net
worth of $3.2 billion. The utilities, though they have
been accumulating deficits, aren't required to report
these as losses on their earnings statements.

That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end the
rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of
electricity to consumers. But should the freeze end
before the statutory deadline of 2002, they get
clobbered. That is because they will immediately have to
book a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What's
more, they can't use the proceeds from planned
power-plant sales to cover those losses; instead, should
the freeze end, they will be obliged to refund some of
the proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&E's case, the refunds
could total $500 million, while in Edison's case, the
amount is $254 million.

Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanism
will be found to let them recoup the money spent on
electricity.

Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. Nettie
Hoge, executive director for San Francisco consumer group
Utility Reform Network, says ratepayers shouldn't end up
footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that
benefited them before prices shot up.

Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the
legislation that got them into such a mess, which was
drafted with their assistance. PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn
says it is best not to ""overanalyze"" the ""old deal.""
Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sit
down with utilities and construct a new agreement, since
""it's in the broad interests of the state not to have
critical energy infrastructure look like a leper.""

Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers ""mutually assured
destruction"" to both utilities and ratepayers. Something
must be done, he says, or consumers throughout most of
the state will experience ""a San Diego-style rate shock.""
The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas & Electric
Co., ended its freeze a year ago and began passing
wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers.
Legislators intervened this summer, however, and
temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills
nearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, is
also accumulating a deficit as a result.

So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities
will be repaid, they will be able to borrow, analysts
say. ""Until we hear politicians of consequence state
otherwise, our position is that we believe the utilities
will be made whole,"" says Richard Cortright, a director
at Standard & Poor's corporate ratings group.

But that opinion could change if it looks like the
utilities will have to swallow a big loss. The result:
lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and
could trigger a downward spiral. ""You're talking about
top-rated companies, though,"" said Ms. Woodland of Fitch
IBCA. ""To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen.""

In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can to
control the hemorrhaging. They have gotten authority from
regulators to buy more power under long-term contracts at
fixed prices, reducing their vulnerability to spot-market
volatility. And they have petitioned federal regulators
to declare California's market so badly flawed that
generators should be denied market pricing and, even,
ordered to pay refunds.

Nevertheless, several forces are working against them.
Although they can sign bilateral contracts, prices remain
high for those as well. What's more, they can't buy less
power than their customers need. If they don't buy
enough, the California Independent System Operator, the
organization responsible for reliability, will step in
and make purchases for them and send them the bill.

Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&E and Edison,
though, is one of timing. The California legislature is
out of session until December, and regulators haven't
even really started to address the issue formally. In the
meantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens of
millions of dollars daily.

2340,"Premise: FERC should investigate the utility decisionmaking that led the 
Califonia market to the point of excess gas demand, rather than rush to 
impose gas price caps.

Utilities had ample opportunity to fill up storage last summer, but most 
likely choose not to for price reasons.

Transwestern had at least a 100 M/D of available capacity to Califonia and to 
the SoCal Needles delivery point through July 2000.  
 
 Avg. Scheduled (compared to 1.1 Bcf/D capacity): April  780 
        May  820
        Jun-Jul  980
        Aug  1050
        Oct-Dec 1080 (essentially full)

During the period April-Jul, TW was able to deliver up to the full 750 M/D at 
Needles, but on many days SoCal gas instituted ""windowing,"" lowering the 
ability to take at Needles to 680-720 M/D.  SoCal's argument was that they 
didn't believe that there was sufficient demand to run at the 750 M/D level 
(even when TW had nominations of 750 M/D).

El Paso was also not full to Califonia until the last month.   At all times 
El Paso  had available capacity at PG&E delivery points.  During the pipeline 
outage El Paso was limited in their ability to fully deliver to the North 
SoCal delivery point.  However, they were not full for deliveries to SoCal at 
the south system delivery point.


2.    Utilities have opposed pipeline expansions to California

Sempra protested Transwestern's 140 M/D Gallup expansion, arguing that there 
is no need for new capacity (CP99-522).

Sempra has also protested Questar's application to convert an oil line to new 
gas pipeline service to California (S. Trails Expansion).

happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. 
""The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is 
something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,"" but the 
""precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword,"" warned 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although 
she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC 
""should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action."" 
Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action 
expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the 
""extraordinary regulatory treatment"" that the Commission gave it. Critics 
claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler

noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. 
""...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in

our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing

she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even 
worse than it is. 
There should have been a ""fuller airing of this issue"" at FERC before the

It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.",Jeff Skilling Jeff,,Enron the Board of Directors Board
2364,"We are pleased to announce the latest addition to the Corporate Benefits Team and clarify the roles of my direct reports.

Chris Rahaim accepted the position of Director of Benefits and joined Enron on August 6, 2001.  Chris comes to Enron from Entergy in New Orleans and has welcomed expertise in the area of Mergers and Acquisitions.  Chris recently obtained his law degree from Loyola University and has relocated his wife and 2-year old son to the Houston area.

Chris will oversee the day-to-day operations and management of the Health & Wellness, Pension and Savings Plans.  He will also function as the point person for benefits-related issues due to any upcoming or transitional mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.

Maryann Roman de Mezza has added management of the Health and Wellness Plans to her current role as the Director of Wellness.  Maryann brings her unique and extensive expertise of disease and vendor management to this area in a further effort to integrate Wellness programs with management of illnesses reported.  Maryann will report to Chris Rahaim.

Mikie Rath will concentrate on special projects, HR Commercialization efforts and employee benefit communication.

Sandy Huseman will concentrate on benefits accounting and return on investments for any plan design changes and implementations.  She will continue to provide guidance for the Health & Wellness team.

2365,"The Washington Global Finance office is chartered with the responsibility to 
support Enron's activities with the Washington-based financing institutions - 
OPIC, EXIM, and the multilateral institutions - the World Bank and IFC and 
the InterAmerican Development Bank.  Every project financing done by the 
company in the emerging markets over the past several years has involved 
these agencies and this year is no exception.

 In the past six months we have supported five projects before these 
institutions:
  Cuiaba - Disbursement is now projected for mid-August.  OPIC is pleased 
with the progress.  We have had to tweak the process to keep the project 
moving forward; that process has been successful.  We have also been heavily 
involved in the environmental aspects of the project, working with the 
project team on the Environmental Health and Safety program, the 
international NGOs and the Conservation Program to keep these aspects on 
track.   
  Gaza -  We have been heavily involved throughout the first half of the year 
getting OPIC to a Board vote which was successful in March.  We used the 
Department of State and other agencies to pressure OPIC politically to do the 
deal.  Since the board vote the developers have been focussed on the 
financing with Arab Bank but we are now in a process of pushing State to get 
OPIC to move forward to financial close on reasonable financial lterms and 
conditions.
  Guatemala barge mounted plant at Puerto Quertzal - OPIC and MARAD are to 
provide financing. We have been working with the finance team to keep the 
project moving forward and are now looking at fijnancial close by the end of 
the summer. 
  Argentina water for the Province of Buenos Aires -   This office is pushing 
both the financing parties, OPIC and IDB, and Azurix to an end of September 
Board approval on a financing that started late spring.  the time frame is 
extremely short but unless we keep on schedule we will lose close to six 
months.  We are driving the schjedule and then overseeing all parties to keep 
the financing on track, so far successfully.   
  RioGen -  We have been working with the Rio team to ensure that 
consultation on the environmental assessment is conducted properly to avoid 
Cuiaba type problems and help the IDB financing.  We are getting the 
requirements with the team sorted out so that the process will go forward in 
an appropriate manner.

 In the past six months we have supported the development efforts of the 
following projects:
  Nigeria - We were heavily involved in getting the World Bank to back away 
from their opposition to our project, as well as getting the State 
Department, DOE and Treasury to aggressively support our efforts to conclude 
a deal in Lagos.  We finally persuaded the Bank to take the position that it 
was not fully current on the status of the project and so could not comment.  
The USG supported our efforts and did help the process by which Enron was 
finally able to conclude a deal.
  Camisea - We were heavily involved in sorting out the environmental 
requirements for this project in Peru to go forward.  We spent considerable 
time educating the developer team on these requirements.  We met on several 
with the Peruvian Minister of Energy and had  him meet with OPIC, IDB and the 
World Bank to better understand the impact of environmental issues on 
financing.
  Bulacan Biomass project, Philippines - We are working with the project team 
to obtain political risk insurance for the project through OPIC or MIGA.
  LNG project, Venezuela:  We are working with the finance team exploring 
OPIC, IFC, IDB financing for this project.
  Pipavov power project, India - Working with the project team regarding 
OPIC, IFC financing for the project
  Subsea fiber laying project, Caribbean:  We have undertaken discussions 
with financing and other institutions re sub-sea fiber laying jproject, 
including addressing licensing requirements of the FCC for international 
telecom projects.
  SIEPAC - We have had meetings with the project team on the status of this 
Central American electricity transmission project and how we might get 
involved.
  Puerto Suarez - We have been working with the project team to address 
environmental issues relating to the transmission line that is in the 
Pantanel in preparation for OPIC or IDB financing.
  Cuiaba II - We have been working with the team to develop a strategy to 
address the siting of compression stations so that the environmentalists will 
not create major problems.  This is a problem for both Phase I and II.
  EES Projects in Southern Cone and Eastern Europe - We have met with the 
IDB, IFC and OPIC and have arrived at an agreed upon financing strucure which 
now awaits EES projects in these regions.


 In the past six months we have also been involved in supporting our existing 
asset base on a variety of issues before these institutions as well as to 
agencies of the USG:
  Dominican Republic - Have been working with the DR team to broaden pressure 
on the government regarding our payment problems, including the IFC and World 
Bank, the IDB and the USG, especially State, Treasury and DOE.
  Trakya, Turkey -   We have been working with the asset team to mobilize USG 
support through OPIC, EXIM, state and Treasury to address payment problems.  
the USG is now aggressively supporting Enron in our effort to get these 
issues under control.  We are also in discussion with OPIC and EXIM about the 
prospective selldown of our equity interest in Trakya, as we are for Cuiaba 
and Dabhol. 


 In the past six months we have also been involved in a range of other issues 
of importance to the company:
  Transfer issues:  I have developed a strategy as to how to approach OPIC, 
EXIM, MIGA and the other financing institutions in the event there is a 
transfer situation. We are now awaiting whether it will be needed.
  OPIC in Mexico:  As part of our overarching relationship with OPIC we have 
agreed to spearhead an initiastive to assist OIPIC develop a program in 
Mexico.  that effort has been very well received by OPIC and George Munoz and 
is ongoing.
  EXIM Relationship:  As part of our effort to establish a relationship with 
EXIM and Chairman Jim Harmon we agreed to spearhead the analysis of the 
market windows issue.  the effort has been very well received; Joe Sutton is 
now on the EXIM Advisory Board and Enron will be on the commission 
considering EXIM's future.  Harmon and EXIM have been very complimentary of 
Enron's initiative in this regard. 
  Environmental Issues:  I am working with Kelly Kimberly and her team, and 
with the Southern Cone to better address our environmental needs in that 
region and throughout the emerging markets.

___________________________________________________________________________
Dear Friends: Please review, correct, make additions and return. Joe


The Energy Services Coalition (please note that we are no longer using
US
WTO ESC) met at the request of Carol Balassa of USTR to get her
perspective
on energy services negotiations of the WTO and what our coalition needs
to
accomplish as well as a time perspective.

Present from the USG were Carol Balassa (USTR), Josephine Ludolph and
Richard Boll (DOC), Russ Profozich (DOE), Patricia Norman (DOS) and a
regular from the ITC.

Joe Hillings, Christina Bolton, Bob Fisher, Steve Burns, Brian Petty and
Chris Long represented the ESC.

Carol conducted an extensive and excellent briefing listing several
phases
of activity. She started the session by telling those present that the
lack
of action at Seattle was not a negative on what we need to accomplish
this
coming year. We are on track and need to produce various position papers
as
early as the end of January.

Articles 19 of the GATT requires that the WTO make progress on
agriculture
and services issues although it does not identify a date certain to
achieve
agreement..

Ambassador Barshefsky is committed to beginning services negotiations
beginning in January.

A Committee on Specific Committments is charged with the responsibility
to
draft issues. The USTR wants to have a definition of issues from the ESC
by
the end of January to be submitted to the USG representatives on the
Committee.

A second significant group in the process is the Working Group On
Domestic
Rights.This group is chaired by Peter Collins. Peter needs to know what
are
the domestic regulatory issues that could be raised by other WTO members
as
reasons not to liberalize various sectors. This information is to be
supplied in the first half of 2000.

In late spring after group one and two have done a significant part of
their work the USTR will be deciding what additional principles are
needed
to be tabled in the negotiation. They expect these working groups will
begin to meet at the WTO by the end of next summer.

Three basic columns headed by (1) Market Access, (2) National Treatment,
(3) Additional Committments (Could be proposed annex such as the process
Tim Richards has proposed in our Electricity Working Group listing
examples) is the format to be developed for the two groups.

Carol advised us that whatever we develop should be with the intention
of
getting Less Developed Countries (LDCs) supporting our basic principles
in
case a multilateral negotiation is not launched. We should work the
current
liberalization process being prosecuted in the APEC and FTAA
negotiations..

The next phase of Carol's presentation addressed the recent response
USTR
received to the questions they submitted to DG 17 (it no longer exisits
under the new commission) asking the EU to address their feelings about
the
liberalization of energy services.

We have not been given a copy of the EU response and Carol has asked Ms.
Klinkers of the EU if the response can be shared with the ESC to secure
industry responce. Carol and others from the USG attending the meeting
are
trying to ascertain just who drafted the responses which they
characterized
as ""confusing and not indicating a real understanding of the current
practices and developments in the energy services sector.""  We do know
that
the USG has called this office to ask how they need to respond to the EU
response that electricity is a good and not a service. Our immediate
response is that this is a matter of some disagreement among EU members
and
the EU staff. The movement of electricity across national boundries may
be
a good but the sale and trading of electricity is definately a service.

The EU response we were told makes the agrument that in their view that
many of the items raised in the October paper of the USTR were GAT
covered
such as construction, engineering, etc and therefore, may not need to be
raised in the services negotiations although these items will at least
need
some sort of annex to make sure they are included.. The EU believes that
if
you own or operate electricity producting  then its a good but if you
operate an IPP to sell electricity to various parties, its a service.

We were told that the EU response does not seem to understand or cover
renewables such as wind and solar both of which are important in
Europe's
plan to diversify and develop green energy.  They also believe that
price/risk management should be considered under finance services not
energy services.


The session was then open to general discussion. Bob Fisher commented
that
the EU does not seem to understand the scope of today's energy services
industry. That we now have a seemless web of energy services that has
been
developed. What about environmental services? Again, the EU response is
confusted and incomplete. Apparently they feel that environmental
services
can be considered elsewhere in the negotiation.

Who from the EU drafted this paper? The staff has changed and we don't
know
how ""high"" in their heirarchy this was considered. Carol Balassa
responded
that she is trying to determine who drafted the response..  Brian Petty
advised that his intelligence is that energy services is being discussed
and considered at the highest levels of the Commission.


Carol told us that she is trying to get everything together before
""talking"" to the EU in January when she hopes to specifically respond
and
discuss their current returned response. Therefore, she is asking the
Energy Services Coalition to complete the work of our four Working
Groups
which will allow the Hills people to develop the definition and basic
negotiating position papers.

The DOS representative then suggested that we engage in some""capacity
building."" This was defined as an outreach program to brief WTO member
delegations on the meaning of energy services. Carol suggested that
after
her January meeting the EU could be agreeable to having our industry
group
meet with their representatives to explain how energy services has
evolved
and what is included in energy services.


We moved to a discussion of the definitions paper itself. Bob Fisher
reminded those present that the current matrix developed for the APEC
process was still an excellent guide to definitions although items such
as
renewables, heating and certain trading and financial services would
need
to be added. To meet some EU concerns that they are not a party to APEC
and
therefore suspicious of any such document, we should remove the
reference
to APEC.

Our group pointed to the Tim Richards paper developed for our
Electricity
Working Group which gives a broad definition but then contains a
footnote
known as the illustrative list which lists the various items that we
believe constitute energy services under that heading. Bob Fisher said
that
this was the likely format we would ultimately adopt in the material
prepared for USTR and others in the WTO process.  Bob said that once
negotiators agree on the need for liberalized energy services they can
""fit"" whatever they want under the broad definition.

The last question raised was what happens to the ATL (accelerated tariff
liberalization) which also covers some energy matters which WTO
countries
had contemplated being approved in Seattle. Carol said that she did not
know.

The meeting then adjourned.


The ESC needs to complete the Working Group process and complete the
questionaire at the earliest possible time to allow the Hills people to
prepare the basic document. Working Group chairs are to be asked to
complete this process by mid January.


Dear Reviewers: Please review at your earliest opportunity, make
corrections, additions and whatever and return to me for distribution.
Distribution will be to our ESC Executive Committee first and then to
our
entire membership of 45 (not to those who have not signed on as members)
and to USG participants.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron

Winning a loser's game

Companies that make the fewest mistakes will fare best in the current
market. And 3M is trying to not miss a trick.

By Michael Sivy

Some sports, such as football, are winner's games. The team with the most
successful offense wins. Others, such as golf, are loser's games. Players
don't defeat their opponents -- victory goes to the person who makes the
fewest mistakes. What kind of game is the stock market? That depends on
what type of market you're in.

Bull markets are basically winner's games. If you take as much risk as you
can stomach, chances are you'll be rewarded. The broad upward sweep of
share prices will make up for any minor errors in timing or stock
selection. But when you're in the midst of a bear market, realize that
you're playing a loser's game. Anything that goes wrong -- a slight
shortfall in earnings, for example -- will have a disproportionately
negative impact.

Right now, investment success hinges on not losing, and the smartest
strategy is to favor companies with a high degree of consistency and
predictability. Such companies typically have strong finances,
well-diversified product lines, a balance between domestic and
international sales and a long history of dividend increases. One stock
that fits that description is Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, or 3M
[MMM], which recently raised its dividend for the 43rd consecutive year.

At first glance, the results 3M reported on Monday look pretty good for a
near-recession economy. Earnings were up 3 cents a share on a 2.3 percent
gain in revenues. Analysts were cautionary, however, because the company's
U.S. revenues were down -- all the gains came from international sales,
which account for half the company's business. I don't have a problem with
that. Domestic sales are off because we're in the middle of an economic
slump. I see the fact that foreign business is supporting the company's
growth as a sign that 3M is well-diversified. The bigger issue, though, is
how the company will fare when the U.S. economy rebounds.

I recommended 3M last July at $88.50 a share as a stalled growth stock that
would get a higher valuation once growth picked up again. Since then, the
share price has risen more than 30 percent to $116.50. And I see further
gains ahead, as domestic sales improve over the next few quarters. For more
than a year, the company has been fine-tuning its product mix, which
includes more than 50,000 items ranging from electronics, medical devices,
and automotive parts to Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes.

That restructuring seems to be accelerating under new CEO W. James
McNerney, 51, formerly the CEO of GE's Aircraft Engine subsidiary. Analysts
applaud the speed with which McNerney has developed a comprehensive
cost-cutting plan since taking over on January 1. Along with first-quarter
earnings, 3M announced it would be shedding 5,000 jobs worldwide, or 7
percent of its workforce. In addition, 3M is planning to up its research
and development spending. The goal: deriving at least 20 percent of 2005
sales from products that don't even exist yet.

This year, earnings gains will likely be held to 5 percent or so, which
makes the stock look fully valued with a P/E of 24. But with a leaner cost
structure and an improving product pipeline, revenue and earnings growth
could accelerate starting in 2002. And that's the kind of outlook that
makes for winners, not losers.

Your Date of Migration is: May 17th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More

2424,"This is how the logic is now within UBSWenergy.com:

All counterparties with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the position out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the appropriate risk book (the book on the online product).  This applies only to finanical swaps and not physical deals.

Please let me know if there is going to be a change and if so what the deals should look like in Tagg.  The programmers need time to modify logic and I need time to test!

We need to get some new books set up in ERMS this week for Netco.

2437,"THE WEEK IN REVIEW
Earnings reports galore; tone generally still cautious.
Software had a choppy week of trading with the movement in stocks driven for
the most in part by earnings releases. The Goldman Sachs Software Index
(GSO) finished the week up 5 pts or 2.7% to 189. The broader markets
finished the week up fractionally as well with the Nasdaq up 0.4% and the
Dow closed up 0.7%. Due to the shortened workweek, there was a plethora of
earnings announcements each night.

In general the results were slightly ahead of published estimates. With a
few exceptions (which we will get to) the tone of the conference calls was
upbeat but still somewhat cautious on the near term outlook. The March
quarter is still hazy as far as the demand environment, but we get the sense
that most companies were able to build a small amount of backlog heading
into the quarter. Guidance was generally left the same as most companies
expect the normal seasonality to occur. Most of our models are calling for
flat to down sequential growth for March still.

There were a few companies that had exceptional December quarters and raised
guidance for the March quarter and the year. The two notable companies is
this regard were SEBL and MERQ, both on the GS Recommended List. Both
companies were very bullish on their conference calls and believe that
software spending is beginning to get back to more normalized levels. MERQ
is an important datapoint for the rest of software since they are the
leading tester of packaged applications. They stated that they saw demand
come in to test applications for SAP, PSFT, SEBL and ORCL. SAP and PSFT also
reported strong quarters this week but were more conservative on their
respective economic outlooks. ORCL is hosting its Analyst Meeting in Redwood
Shores on Wednesday January 30, so we should get an update on their
application business at that time.

KEY DISCUSSION POINTS
1) Thoughts on competition and supply chain in general
There has been a lot of discussion and controversy surrounding market share
and competitive wins regarding the supply chain market and the three major
vendors (ITWO, MANU and SAP). The best gauge we have for looking at market
share is license revenue comparisons for the last few quarters.

Comparing ITWO and MANU's (we'll get to SAP later) license revenues for the
last four quarters, it would seem as if ITWO had lost share in June but has
taken a small amount of share from MANU (ITWO's share has gone from 70% to
77%) since. However, to give MANU credit they have not had the effect of
December in their reported results and we are projecting license revenues to
be up 15% in February while we believe that ITWO's license revenues will be
down 5%. If our estimates become reality then ITWO would be back to 70%
share with MANU at 30%.

What this exercise basically showed us is that neither company is taking
share from one another in the overall supply chain space in the last year.
In fact we believe that there is less overlap between the companies in the
marketplace than most investors believe. ITWO still is discrete
manufacturing focused, but has won deals in MANU's backyard of CPG of late.
On the flip side, MANU has better vertical diversification with a focus on
transportation management and has won deals of late in high tech. What we do
believe is that when demand for supply chain software returns both companies
should rebound. However, given its vertical focus, we would argue that ITWO
has more upside potential if high tech and industrial rebound more quickly
than other vertical areas.

SAP, unlike the two other vendors breaks out supply chain revenues by
customer intent. Given that they can sell a bundled suite of ERP, SCM (what
they call APO) and CRM solutions it is very difficult to tell what is
actually being used for supply chain. Our checks with the SI community
reveal that most of what SAP is selling as SCM is some basic demand and
material planning solutions. Also, we have not been able to find many
instances where SAP has beaten either ITWO or MANU head-to-head. Bottom line
is, despite SAP's claims earlier in the week, they are not dominating the
supply chain market.

2) Updated Fundamental Scorecard for the Supplier Relationship Mgt market
Now that we have had a chance to digest the earnings of all the SRM
companies under coverage, we have put together a scorecard to help investors
differentiate the companies by four main areas: Financial Performance,
Product Positioning, Organizational Strength and Industry Dynamics. Here are
a few high level thoughts on the sector in general.

	*Cost structures are improving - all the vendors with the exception
of CMRC did a good job of taking major steps at re-aligning their cost
structures. While S&M as a percentage of license revenues remains very high
compared to historical levels the companies were able to lower this ratio
dramatically in the quarter.

	*Balance sheets also improved - in general DSOs were down from
September due to better linearity (due to in part spillover) and a healthier
demand environment. Deferred revenues for the most part stabilized if not
ticked up and cash burn rates have slowed.

	*New products are important for 2002 growth - all the vendors are
hoping that new products will be able to spark growth in the next 4 quarters
both with new customers and with the current installed base. Innovation is
important and the companies have been more reluctant to cut R&D than other
areas of the firm.

8 Commercial Women  (does not include you, but currently includes myself - having a personal debate over being a poster child)
6 Commercial Support Women
10 Commercial Males - including more representation from London office
6 Commercial Support Men

Sunjay is going to contact the London office (but not use his HR channels - I have recommended that he call Marcello) to identify more International Meritocratic candidiates that are women. Assuming he identifies three women, I can drop myself as a meritocratic candidate.  : )

Sunjay understands that we are trying to identify a portfolio of candidates that represent a balance.  As such, he will continue to target other employees to further represent commercial support and specialized technical.

Please delete individuals as appropriate from attached presentation and forward back to Sunjay, with myself cc'd.

SSB Electrical Equipment Analyst Power Supply/Demand Outlook

*	Jeff Sprague, SSB's Electrical Equipment analyst, has an interesting
perspective on the supply/demand balance for power.  His forecast is based
on GE's order book for turbines, which we think is an excellent source of
info.
*	Jeff points out that no orders have been canceled so far.
*	Although there are slight differences in our estimations of new
plant builds (his is higher) and reserve margin (his is higher), we think
this info. supports our view.  On the margin, new plant builds exceed
demand, and reduce the tightness in the market, as measured by reserve
margins.  We think there will be downward pressure on power prices and spark
spreads in this environment.

I've also attached Jeff's comments below, which he sent to his clients,
vis-a-vis the Electrical Equipment sector and GE in particular, as well as
our recent PC6 report, for reference.  Any questions, please call. - Ray

 <<PC6final.pdf>>  <<Sprague--Supply&Demand--client.xls>>

Jeff's Sprague's (212-816-6699) comments:

GE stock has been weak in recent days as concerns about lower power prices
have hurt utility stocks and raised the fear that power capacity is being
overbuilt.

Ultimately enough capacity will be deployed in the US, but we do not believe
we are there yet.  Based on our analysis of GE's delivery plans, the US will
reach a 14% reserve margin (based on capability at summer peak load) in
2002.

We do not expect the industry to ever return to the 20%+ reserve margins of
yesteryear, but 14% seems far from excessive given the very severe
shortcomings of the electrical grid (see our 6/4 report on the grid).

If GE's output in '03 is flat with '02, reserve margins would rise to a
still reasonable 16%.  GE has filled 90-95% of its backlog for 2003 and has
experienced no cancellations or push-outs in orders to date.

The bottom line is we believe the sell-off in GE is overdone.  We will
publish a more detailed report on the supply demand equation in the U.S.
power market in the coming days.  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a
more detailed analysis.

-All of the traders and structuring, including Bernie Aucoin told me that John Llodra drove both the CMP and NStar deals. Total income $8.5 million.
-I believe Delainey was correct in saying that Ozzie was the brains behind Alamac but Heather did the execution. Total income for the East $7.5 million.
-Most of the rest of the deals were done after I came in.
-Mid market sales have increased.(700% over the first half of 2000)
-This group was in meltdown when I came in(at least on the origination side). I would like to get some credit for stopping the bleeding and starting the rebuilding process in a difficult environment.

As you are well aware, we filed an arbitration against EPME under the swap agreement and El Paso Corp. under the guaranty. Our hope was that once the El Paso legal department got involved this would come to an amicable resolution. Not so fast.  While EPME recognizes that it is contractually obligated to arbitrate under the swap agreement, El Paso Corp. is claiming that it is not subject to arbitration and has filed a lawsuit asking a court to declare that El Paso Corp. is not subject to arbitration. 

We had a call with El Paso's lawyers early this morning to discuss where we are and where we are going. We told El Paso's lawyers that we will agree to drop El Paso Corp. from the arbitration if they agree to drop their lawsuit. (I have talked to Duran and Deffner about this and they have made it clear that our overriding objective is to monetize the swap agreement.  To do so, we need an arbitration panel's ruling on the confidentiality provision in the swap agreement.  The guaranty issue is, in their view, of secondary concern at this time). During the call, EPME asked for 10 days to name their party arbitrator.  We agreed. By the way, we have already appointed our party arbitrator.  El Paso's lawyers are going to check with their client today to confirm that the lawsuit will be dropped.

On the arbitration front, once EPME names its party arbitrator, the two party arbitrators will get together and select a neutral arbitrator.  We should expect that process to take about 30 days.  Then the entire arbitration panel will get together and set an arbitration schedule.

I will keep you updated.

I just received this confirmation that the (3) auxiliary boilers needed to provide the additional 600 kpph of steam to ConEd at Brooklyn Navy Yard should fit easily on the leased space adjacent to the existing water treatment building for the cogen plant. his is based on auxiliary boiler footprints just received from Babcock & Wilcox, an aux boiler OEM.

The attached layout shows the footprint of the boilers overlayed next to the water treatment building in the parking lot currently under lease by the partnership. It also shows the approximate 25% of space currently being used by others at the opposite end of the parking lot that is assumed not available for additional expansion.

The layout is as accurate as we can make it scaling the drawings available without an actual survey. However, it appears there is plenty of room available to add this equipment.

By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Edison International(NYSE:EIX <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=eix&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/eix.html>), in a last-ditch bid to stay solvent, is restructuring a $1.2 billion junk bond sale because investors are afraid of getting caught in a second big California utility bankruptcy, bond market analysts and investors said on Tuesday. 
Edison, the parent of cash-strapped utility Southern California Edison (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Southern%0ACalifornia%20Edison%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Southern%20California%20Edison&cs=nw>), is considering trimming its bond sale and adding a bank term loan, the analysts and investors said. 
Rosemead, California-based Edison needs cash this week as it struggles with California's power crisis, analysts said. The company is trying to rid itself of debt maturing this year, including a fully drawn down $618 million bank credit line expiring Saturday. 
The seven-year secured notes being sold by Mission Energy Holding Co. have not found enough buyers despite carrying yields as high as 13.5 percent, analysts said. That's more than four percentage points above the recent 9.33 percent yield on a typical junk-rated electric utility bond, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. 
``We were hearing it was significantly undersubscribed around midday when the deal was scheduled to price, so the assumption is it will resurface in another form, probably much cheaper and restructured,'' said John Atkins, a corporate bond analyst at IDEAglobal.com <http://IDEAglobal.com>, a New York-based research firm. 
In the utility's semi-weekly conference call with holders of defaulted SoCal Edison debt, Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci said Tuesday afternoon there is ``virtually nothing the company can say'' about the private bond sale. 
Goldman Sachs & Co., which sources said is arranging the bond sale, also declined to comment. 
Edison said earlier this month it intended to use bond sale proceeds to pay down the bank credit line, as well as $250 million of notes due July 18 and $350 million due Nov. 1. 
Mission Energy Holding, which Edison created specifically to raise cash, was designed to be shielded from any bankruptcy of SoCal Edison, Edison or Edison Mission Energy. Some investors have said they are concerned the shield may not prove strong enough. 
Moody's Investors Service rated Mission Energy Holding's notes ``Ba2,'' its second highest junk grade. Standard & Poor's, rated them ``BB-minus,'' one notch lower. 
SoCal Edison, which has defaulted on $931 million of bonds and commercial paper, ran up more than $5.4 billion of debt because California's utility deregulation blocked it from recouping its soaring wholesale power costs. It agreed in April with Gov. Gray Davis (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Gov.%20Gray%20Davis%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Gov.%20Gray%20Davis&cs=nw>) on a rescue plan, but regulators have been slow to implement it, and many legislators oppose it. 
The utility is California's second largest; the largest, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp.(NYSE:PCG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pcg&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/p/pcg.html>), filed for bankruptcy protection on April 6. 
Shares of Edison closed Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22New%20York%20Stock%0AExchange%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=York%20Stock%20Exchange>) at $11.24, down 33 cents.

2490,"Recap:
The California project's (""ACE"") fundamental position, coal generation in gas-on-margin market, is attractive on the fundamentals.  ACE's economics through a range of scenarios (forward SRAC rates) also appears attractive.  However, due to the uncertainty in the California market, the deal team needs to resolve issues 1. and 2. (at minimum) before returning for final approval:

Timing Risk:  Price and execute a 30-40 day call on ""deal purchase"" to keep competition at bay and buy time to work through market and partner risks.
Market Risk:  Approach So Cal Edison and CDWR to structure and close a deal that enables ACE to sell directly to CDWR (or other credit worthy counter party for term, or at least until So Cal Edison starts honouring its QF contract with ACE on a current pay basis.
Partner Risk:  Approach Constellation, co-managing partner in ACE, to price/structure buyout of their interest in ACE or a swap of Pennsylvania for California project positions.

Follow Up:
The following actions have been taken:

Timing Risk:  Greg Blair initiated discussions last night with the seller's advisor, Chase, to purchase an option to close in late April.  We expect to hear back from Ahlstrom (seller) today or Friday.  Deal team will notify Office of Chairman when we discover Ahlstrom's bottom line on option premium, expiration date and strike price.
Market Risk & Partner Risk:  Greg Blair and Terry Donovan put messages into Millenium (ACE manager) and Constellation to get things moving on CDWR/Edison deal and to see if we can structure a deal to get control of ACE. Substantive progress on either front will be reported.

No action needed on your part, but just in case you hear something through the grapevine, here is current situation:

Summary

- AEP/CP&L have economic interests in the Brownsville area which are best served if we do not locate our tie in Brownsville Public Utility Board's (BPUB's) service territory and BPUB does not obtain the  system upgrades which would be justified by our tie.
- AEP is trying to stall our Presidential Permit Application and to coerce us into moving the tie onto their system.
- BPUB sees this as an attack on their interests and is planning to challenge AEP.
- 5 MOU's have been signed with customers and discussions are continuing with 12 others, who have all been met and have expressed interest.
- We are optimistic that the PP will be issued and standard Ercot treatments will prevail, but we will likely be delayed to sometime early next year.


History

- Enron filed Presidential Permit (PP) Application
- CP&L (owned by AEP) intervened against the application and raised some technical issues
- DOE asked Enron and CP&L/AEP to meet and resolve issues
- Meeting occurred between Enron and CP&L/AEP. General technical solutions were identified, with specific solutions to be determined through a SPS study.
- Enron drafted a letter outlining the points covered in our meeting with CP&L/AEP, intending to have the letter signed by both of us and forwarded to DOE, requesting that DOE proceed with issuing the PP.
- AP&L/AEP refused to sign the letter and are now arguing that an SPS scheme is not sufficient for the proposed tie location (although AEP operates under SPS elsewhere within Ercot, they argue that ours is a special case. Independent opinion (and our own) is that there is little merit to the CP&L/AEP position).
- AEP have told us that if we move the tie to a location West of Brownsville (on AEP's proposed line expansion), that they would drop all opposition.
- AEP/CP&L have since approached the Ercot Board arguing that cost studies should be done on alternate tie locations and the system cost impact thereof.
- AEP/CP&L have submitted to the Ercot Board that Enron should be responsible for any costs associated building the tie at anything other than the least-cost (system perspective) location.

Current Status
- Brownsville (BPUB) are incensed at AEP/CP&L's behaviour and are planning the following actions:
	- Making submission to Ercot that:
		-  BPUB informed Ercot of the project 14 months ago and no further studies or committee reviews by Ercot should be necessary.
		- No changes to current Ercot procedures should be contemplated and the tie should be viewed as a firm, native BPUB load 
	- BPUB lawyer is drafting letter to go to AEP demanding that AEP honor their previous agreement with BPUB to be supportive of BPUB projects.
	- BPUB CEO, engineer and lawyer will visit PUC-T next week to make the case that no special arrangements should be made with regard to Enron or BPUB 	needing to pick up additional system costs
- At this point, BPUB is highly motivated and is striking out with an aggressive representation of their position as there are implications for them which go beyond the current project. Furthermore, there is little love lost between BPUB and AEP.
- Although moving to the AEP-proposed location would remove AEP as an obstacle, we would lose the work done to date preparing with BPUB and would probably make an enemy of BPUB.
- Bob Franks (regulatory), Scott Laidlaw (engineering/technical) and myself are coordinating with Bracewell Patterson (regulatory advisors) on Enron's strategy and level of support for BPUB.",Ercot Scott Laidlaw Bracewell Patterson,,"AEP CP&L Brownsville Public Utility Board's BPUB Presidential Permit Application MOU PP Presidential Permit (PP) Application

If you get this while on vacation, I do apologize for interrupting your break.  I have left you a voicemail on the same subject, but thought I would send it to you in writing as well.

Following up on this morning's meeting with Louise and Joe Deffner on the requested ammendments, we went through the list of issues sent by Tod 9/17, and Kevin's subsequent response.

As both Kevin and Louise stated, the first issue, the clarification on banking, is a confirmation of the ""intent of the deal"".  As you remember, the project's ability to bank RECs and energy, and to carry that bank forward, is the intent of the deal.  We need your recognition that this is the case so that we can go forward with this clarification ammendment.

We hope to keep this moving in your absense and appreciate your cooperation on this point.  Please give me a call, or at a minimum, please share your perspective with Louise on this issue so that we can keep the financing moving forward.

Louise,

I don't think we have much value in assigning the broker client deals. Most contracts have automatically terminated or have been terminated by the brokers on account of not having access to the submission screens.

There is very little outstanding money left in these contracts, anyway - most of them have monthly payments and those which do not are paid to only Q1 2002, anyway.

Therefore, I think there is little value in pursuing assignment of these and I recommend we instead pursue new contracts (at the appropriate time), perhaps with the first few months free to soothe any bad feelings on their part.

Do you agree?

2533,"Hi everyone - in spite of today's terrible news,   Rahil reminded me that tomorrow is EOL's 2nd birthday so I wanted to take the opportunity to congratulate everyone from the 'original' skeleton crew (though I know I've missed many people - apologies).   We are so incredibly close to 1 trillion in notional revs. -- $944 bn or so last time I checked -- that it's even more frustrating to see the company going down the tubes when this should really be a time of massive celebration.  In any event, congratulations to all of you, it's been a privilege working alongside all of you, and more importantly, becoming friends with you.  I hope some of us get a chance to work together again going forward, but regardless, please stay in touch all of you whatever happens next, and make sure you track me down if you are planning to be in Toronto at any point as well.

I told Jay about this yesterday and so you may have heard from him already but I wanted to make sure you knew that the metals deal count has gone up from an average of about 450 per day to aproximately 1200 per. I see J Aaron and EDF Mann being the primary counterparties doing the trading.

- It has come to my attention that some groups (back office) have been told that each individual within their group can elect to be part of the Estate or of NewCo. This is surprising to me. No such election has been offered to anyone in EnronOnline (nor do I think it would make sense to offer that), but before I tell people they do not have a choice, I wanted to check with you.  - ?

- On the issue of bonuses: The numbers we put together made sense to me in the context of an annual  bonus with some element of retention mixed in. According to the auctions documents I looked at, retention is identified as being for a 1 year period, with 1/2 of the amount paid up front and 1/2 one year later. If this is the case, it significantly changes the complexion (i.e. more like a retention payment with an element of bonus, rather than bonus with an element of retention) and we should revisit the numbers.

2547,"Like you, I am getting very frustrated with this process.  I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible.  I am not trying to ""hold up"" the deal at the last minute.  I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.

I am generally ok with the concept of the option, the doc, and comp parameters.  In addition, I need assurances that 90 day retentions will be paid to the people we have identified who deserve them and haven't received them and I need to know that the comp conveyed to me in 2001 is secure. 

It is unlikely that I would be here today if it weren't for the collective comp conveyed to me during 2001.  I have received assurances from the two of you, Oxley, and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received.  The messages generally start with ""it's safe,"" ""don't worry about it,"" ""all comp paid in 2001 advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate,"" ""low probability that there will be any issues,"" ....  At other times, particularly when you want me to commit to this deal, the logic changes.  The comp paid in 2001 becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if I'm on the team.  While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days, it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do.

When I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in 2001 the answer is that it is off the table -- a non-starter.  Why?  
Because the estate is negotiating the deal.  Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me.
Because the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate.  I wouldn't be here but for the legacy issues with the estate -- it is definitely the buyer's issue!
Because people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee.  I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estate/the buyer have time.
Because we don't know who from the buyer to negotiate with.  Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues -- why not figure it out now.
Because this deal is bigger than Tim Belden.  I'm not delusional.  I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts.  If it's bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me.


Since I am not ""on the team"" right now, I am also working with a great deal less information than you have.  I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people ""on the team"" versus not ""on the team.""  However, the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind.  For example, I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done, conveyed to the creditors/buyer/estate/judge works.  Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them.  If that's the case, you could add my indemnification amount (adjusted by probability of payout) to that total and it surely wouldn't blow up the deal.  Unless, the probability of payout is high.

Furthermore, I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc (subject to comment from my lawyer, but I'll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum).  I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer.  At that point in time, I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc.  Perhaps at that time, some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier.  Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent.  I don't understand why this is a non-starter issue, but I don't have the same information that you do.

To be clear, here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer:
the deal as it exists plus
retention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them.
indemnification of 2001 comp up to $4 million.

I expect that the two of you will tell me that I'm not on the team, that 800 people are going home, and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives.  That is not what I want to happen.  If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn't happen.  I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions.  I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have.

In talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in.  I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days.  I trust that you are trying to do the right thing.  There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time.  

Finally, I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier.  It's probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say.  I will call to see that you received and read this e-mail.  I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do.

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.",Jeff McMahon Ken Lay Greg Whalley Jeff Ray Bowen Ray Mark Muller Mark Jim Fallon Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman John Lavorato Louise Kitchen,,the United States Trustee The Creditors' Committee Enron NETCO Enron North America the Creditors' Committee the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp Creditor's Committee Treasurer - Enron Corp Enron Corp Enron Corp.

There have been several media reports this morning regarding the status of our efforts to preserve the value of our North American natural gas and power business.  As we've said, we'd like to form a joint venture with an entity with a strong credit rating so that our trading business can continue to deliver value to our company and our creditors.  We'd like to update you on the timing of the process as we currently see it.

This Wednesday, December 19th, we will ask the Bankruptcy Court to approve bid procedures for potential suitors to follow as they proceed to make offers for a joint venture.  If we are successful, we will ask the judge to set a bid deadline of January 7th, 2002.  At that point, we would review the bids with the Creditors' Committee and, after a process to determine the best offer, we will jointly ask the Bankruptcy Court to approve the winning bid.  Additionally, we will continue to try to close a deal prior to January 7th, which would then be subject to competitive bids form other counterparties.   The number of counterparties interested in a deal continues to grow.

Between now and the bid deadline, we will continue to work with all interested parties and assist them in their respective due diligence processes so that they can make the most informed bids.  Many of our colleagues will be working very hard over the holidays to move this process along and help ensure our efforts to come out of bankruptcy are successful.  Please give them your full cooperation and support.

As you work a deal for NewCo I wanted to make sure that we include the various tools we use in structuring for pricing and evaluating deals (i.e., we want to make sure the NewCo will have the exclusive rights to this information).  Kelli has provided a basic list of this information below.  Most relates to the exotica functions (and any associated code) that Research has created for structuring deals.

Hi Louise.  A few questions/issues when you have a moment:

1. Will NetCo need a copy of Infinity for interest rate/fx trading and risk management?  I pitched the question to Jeff Golden.  He thinks the bank will provide this function and the technology, but he wasn't 100% sure.

2. We have a potential problem with visas.  Bob Hillier is on an L1 visa, and many of the development staff are on H1B's.  Once we get a letter from the new entity stating that these people have employment, the transfer process can begin, but it will take at least a week for L1 and 2-3 weeks for H1B (this is what I am told).  If closing happens very quickly after the actual party is chosen, we are going to be squeezed.  One solution may be to let all these people continue to work for Enron until the visa transfer is complete.  Otherwise, we will have to send them home without salary or benefits in the meantime.  

3.  When you have a moment, I would like to talk to you about two EES people.

***********************************************************************

The collapse of the proposed Enron/Dynegy merger has sent a shock wave through
the industry but does not threaten the effective functioning of wholesale gas
and power markets in North America. Major market participants have had more
than a month to unwind positions with Enron, and thus the overall exposure has
been greatly reduced.

*  Wholesale gas and power markets in North America continue to function
effectively. There is no reason for the physical flow of gas or power to be
impeded this winter.

*  Liquidity for longer-term structured products has temporarily been reduced.
Others will move in to fill the gap, but this will take time.

*  Enron's problems do not represent a critical blow to deregulating gas and
power markets.

We are sending this Alert to Global Energy clients also because of Enron's
major role in the US gas and power markets.

Here is an update of some recent Enron developments.

Enron Europe Closes Certain Operations

Following Enron's credit rating downgrade yesterday and the impact that had on Enron Europe's ability to trade, Enron Europe has asked a court to appoint an Administrator.  What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions.  This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex.  It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland.

Efforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible.  There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term.

This action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees.  Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved.

Enron Appoints New Board Member

Yesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.  He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters.  Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies.  Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee.

Enron Evaluates Dividends

Today Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.

2609,"SENT ON BEHALF OF DEREK FLAMAN:

The following is a response to Bill's question: ""When does the tariff require the LC to be renewed?  Do we have some time to wait until mid-December?""

Also attached to this email is Lori Poffenroth's November 9 memo which sets forth Lori's calculations based on WSP/PPA's formulas set forth in their tariffs for Initial Amounts, Revised Amounts, Recommended October 31 Amounts, and Estimated December 31 Amounts.

All of the WSP's and the PPA's Prudential Requirements allow the WSP's and the PPA to reevaluate EDCC's credit limit and/or request additional security from time to time.  While the following sets out in more detail the manner in which each WSP and the PPA can do this, all of the Prudential Requirements are the same in the following two respects: (1) if at any time EDCC's financial obligations to the WSP/PPA (the ""Financial Obligations"") exceed the existing credit limit (or a certain percentage thereof), the WSP/PPA has the right to request additional security (the ""Additional Security""); and (2) if EDCC fails to post the Additional Security within the requisite time period, the WSP/PPA reserves the right to suspend service to EDCC.

Note that, as of today, no WSP/PPA has requested Additional Security.  

However, as soon as possible, the following needs to occur in those instances where the October 31 Amount exceeds the Existing Amount: (1) we should post the Additional Security now; or (2) we put ourselves in a position to be able to post the Additional Security within the requisite time period.  Consequently, we do have some time to wait until mid-December provided that (2) has occurred.

As at December 31, we must post the December 31 Amount.

ATCO

Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$300,000	$300,000	$450,000	

As at October 31, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $300,000 and the posted security is $300,000; therefore, no Additional Security is currently required.  As at December 31, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $450,000 and the posted security will have expired; therefore $450,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time.  Such Additional Security will be due within 5 days of ATCO's request.

As at October 31: for Calgary, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $750,000 and the posted security is $475,000 - therefore, the Additional Security which may be required is $275,000; for Red Deer, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $40,000 and the posted security is $30,000 - therefore, $10,000 of Additional Security may be required; for Lethbridge, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $35,000 and the posted security is $15,000 - therefore, $20,000 of Additional Security may be required.

As at December 31: for Calgary, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $1,850,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $1,850,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time; for Red Deer, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $75,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $75,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time; for Lethbridge, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $65,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $65,000 of Additional Security will be required.  

All of the foregoing Additional Security is due within the number of days required by Enmax (i.e. at Enmax's discretion).

EPCOR

Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$150,000	$150,000	$1,000,000	

Ponoka

Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$5,000	$12,000	$12,000	

As at October 31: for EPCOR, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $150,000 and the posted security is $150,000 - therefore, no Additional Security is currently required; for Ponoka, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $12,000 and the posted security is $5,000 - therefore, $7,000 of Additional Security may be required.

As at December 31: for EPCOR, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $1,000,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $1,000,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time; for Ponoka, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $12,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $12,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time.

All of the aforementioned Additional Security is due within 10 business days of EPCOR's request.

Power Pool of Alberta ""PPA""

Existing Amount 	Recommended October 31 Amount	Estimated December 31 Amount	
$4,800,000	$2,500,000	$6,000,000	

As at October 31, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $2,500,000 and the posted security is $4,800,000 - therefore, no Additional Security is currently required.

As at December 31, the Financial Obligations have been calculated to be $6,000,000 and the posted security will have expired - therefore, $6,000,000 of Additional Security will be required at that time.

All of the aforementioned Additional Security is due within the number of days set by the PPA (i.e. at the PPA's discretion)

UtiliCorp.

$0	Barry/Lori to calculate	Barry/Lori to calculate	

UtiliCorp.'s Prudential Requirements, like the other WSP's and PPA's Prudential Requirements, allow UtiliCorp. to re-evaluate EDCC's credit limit and/or request Additional Security from time to time.  To date, UtiliCorp. has not exercised their right to request Additional Security from EDCC.  As such, Financial Obligations with respect to UtiliCorp. have not been calculated.  To be prudent, Barry/Lori will calculate a Recommended October 31 Amount and an Estimated December 31 Amount so that we are prepared in the event that UtiliCorp. does at some point exercise its right to require us to post Additional Security.

We have already done a number of things to help reduce AEP's exposure to Enron, none of which were required contractually.  We made a margin payment of $50,000,000.  We arranged ring-trades with Allegheny which reduced your exposure by over $90,000,000.  We have proposed a number of assignments which would reduce your exposure to Enron incrementally.  

Conversely, pursuant to our contracts AEP has failed to pay a $1,311,625.46 swap settlement that was due on 11/8/01.  Additionally, a margin call which was due to Enron on 11/8/01 in the amount of $19,250,000 and remains unpaid.  Additionally, AEP has failed to continue to trade with Enron which was not our understanding of the agreement.

Enron maintains its investment grade credit rating and is receiving $1.5 billion of additional funded equity capital from Dynegy as announced on Friday.  We are more than happy to continue helping you to reduce exposures in mutually agreeable manners but do not agree to the below list of requests.  We need you to address these above issues before we can progress on these exposure reductions.

Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)

     (Adds comment from CFO Fastow in fourth paragraph, Enron's
short-term borrowing rates in seventh paragraph.)

     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million
loan, ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cut
off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.

     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its
finances. The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75
percent this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends
on a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to
finance day-to-day operations.

     Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service placed all $13
billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for
possible downgrade. As a second-tier commercial paper borrower,
any drop in its rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper
market and raise the costs of short-term debt.

     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.
He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,
giving it enough cash to operate normally.

     Enron shares rose as much as 12.6 percent during the call to
$23.25. They pared the gain to $21.80, up $1.15.

     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,
declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, declined
to comment.

                      Commercial Paper Rates

     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until
Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade.

     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and
advice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the
company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-
fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along
with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion
loan.

     Earlier this week, an investor sued Enron, saying two
partnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadership
of them was a conflict of interest.

     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by Fastow. Dismantling some of the partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors.

     Enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buy
and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its
books.

     Investors said they were concerned that Enron may be forced
to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in
cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may have
to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies if Enron's
debt ratings fall too far.

Enron CFO: Company Has Sufficient Liquidity
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/23/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company had procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest in dealings between Enron and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.
In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a ""Chinese wall"" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
The procedures were ""rigorously followed,"" Lay said. 
In previous filings with the SEC, Enron said the terms of the transactions with the partnerships were ""reasonable compared to those which could have been negotiated with unrelated third parties."" 
Fastow resigned from the partnerships, which were known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investments LP in late July. 
The company also is involved in other off-balance sheet financing vehicles, including Marlin Water Trust II and Whitewing. 
During the conference call, investors said they were frustrated by the complex nature of the trusts, and asked for more information. 
Lay said the company would be providing a list of ""Frequently Asked Questions"" on its Web site later Tuesday that may provide more details. 
After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. 
Lay said he was ""extremely disappointed"" in the current stock price. 
""Our businesses are performing very well and we are continuing to conduct business,"" he said. 

During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. 
Enron officials also addressed concerns that investors had about the potential need to issue additional Enron stock. 
Under certain circumstances, for example, if both Enron's stock and credit rating fall to certain levels, the company would need to issue additional shares to the partnerships, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. 
Enron officials declined to say how much dilution would occur under a ""worst-case scenario."" 
However, the officials said they doubted there would be a need to issue the additional stock because the company plans to work with the credit-rating agencies to prevent such an event. 
Moody's put Enron on watch for a downgrade of its long-term debt last week after the company announced a $1 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss. 
According to Lay, Enron's debt rating would need to fall several notches to below investment grade in order to trigger the need to issue more stock. 
""We are committed to maintaining our ratings,"" Lay said. ""Moody's said they would work with us,"" he added. 
Furthermore, Fastow said, Enron expects to have ""sufficient liquidity"" to meet all its capital requirements. 

Enron's efforts to unwind the LJM partnerships contributed to a reduction of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. However, Enron's Lay said the lower number of shares outstanding wouldn't affect the company's earnings outlook. 
Enron has said it expects to earn $1.80 a share in 2001 and $2.15 a share in 2002. The numbers are in line with the consensus estimates reported by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
""Despite the economy going softer, we think we can meet that,"" Lay said.

Enron cuts shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd due to partnership deal

10/18/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd as the company decided to repurchase 55 mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 
Enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a 1.01 bln usd charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a 618 mln usd loss.
However, the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity dropped to 9.5 bln usd, the company said. 
In an interview, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1.01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Fastow. 
In a conference call yesterday with investors, Lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company ""unwound"" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln. 
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a ""structured finance vehicle"" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. 
The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took. 
Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply, the report said. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. 
Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, ""the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this,"" Causey said. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described the capital reduction ""as just a balance-sheet issue"" and therefore was not deemed ""material"" for disclosure purposes.

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as ""data adequate"" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 
The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.
Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004.

Blowback 
Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine </forbes>, 11.12.01 

Did Enron use partnerships to artificially boost earnings? Lawyers are rubbing their hands.
If the truth sets you free, the top echelon at Enron Corp., present and past, should be feeling positively footloose these days. Just in time to get shackled by a slew of shareholder suits. 

Private securities lawyers and the Securities & Exchange Commission are looking into the Houston energy trading firm's complex relationships with outside partnerships it used to hedge against fluctuations in the value of its investments. Where Enron sees 21st-century financial engineering, lawyers see possible earnings inflation. (Chairman Kenneth Lay says Enron is cooperating with the SEC inquiry.) 

One partnership, run by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, added $236 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2001, boosting Enron's $425 million in net income in that period. The partnership's contribution plunged to $5 million in the second quarter ended June 30, but investors only found out Aug. 14--when Enron filed its quarterly 10-Q with the SEC. Oddly enough, that was the day Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling unexpectedly resigned. 

Expect class-action lawyers to go after the profits Skilling and other insiders made by selling $660 million in stock when shares were flying high. (They're down 78% from August 2000.) Since Skilling left, Enron has taken a $1.2 billion hit to shareholders' equity to unwind partnerships. 

""They certainly misled the market as to the size of [partnership losses],"" says Thomas Shapiro, one of several lawyers filing shareholder suits against Enron. Who knows what will emerge from some of the other partnerships?

Enron Shares Rise, Rebounding From Nine-Year Low (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in sixth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares rose as
much as 19 percent, one day after falling to their lowest level in
more than nine years, amid speculation the company may be a
takeover target.

     Shares of the top energy trader rose $1.58, or 14 percent, to
$12.74 in midday trading of 19.9 million shares, compared with the
three-month daily average of 10.4 million shares. Earlier, the
shares hit $13.25.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen 84 percent this
year. They have lost more than half their value this month amid a
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into partnerships
headed by Andrew Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer.
Fastow was ousted last week in an attempt to restore confidence in
the stock.

     ``There are rumors out there that they are a potential
takeover target, but I think it's very unlikely that anyone will
buy them out at this point,'' said Zach Wagner, an analyst at
Edward Jones & Co. ``There are too many uncertainties.''

     Enron is more likely to get a large cash infusion from an
investor, Wagner said. He has a ``reduce'' rating on Enron shares.
He doesn't own the stock.

     The Wall Street Journal today said General Electric Co.'s GE
Capital, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Royal Dutch
Petroleum Co. are ``among the names bandied about'' as potential
buyers for all or part of Enron.

Enron Shares Rise as Analysts Cite Bargain-Hunting, Financing Speculation
By Christina Cheddar

10/31/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- After losing nearly two-thirds of their value over the past two weeks, Enron Corp. shares regained some lost ground Wednesday.
Bargain-hunting and speculation were said to be behind the buying, with some suggesting that Enron is nearing a deal for additional financing, while others are said to be mulling the possibility the company may be acquired. 
In afternoon trading on New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares (ENE) were up $1.49, or 13%, to $12.65 on volume of 24.9 million shares. Earlier, the stock traded as high as $13.25. 
Enron, which typically trades an average of 10 million shares a day, was again one of the most actively traded stocks on the Big Board. On Tuesday, Enron shares set a 52-week low of $10.90, which was the stock's lowest level in a decade. 
Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade attributed the jump in Enron's stock to investors attracted by its low price. Those buyers, he said, are hoping not to be hit by the ""double swords"" hanging over the Houston energy trader -- a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the financial dealings of its former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with an off-balance sheet financing vehicle and the possibility of another credit-rating downgrade by Moody's, which could trigger the need to issue additional stock and thereby dilute the holdings of existing investors. 
In addition, there is speculation ""through the Houston circuit"" that Enron may be close to securing additional financing, said Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale. If the speculation proves true, the financing would help Enron to shore up its financial condition and improve confidence among investors as well as its business partners. 
Investors also may be placing their bets on the belief that Enron shares have eroded enough in value to make the company a takeover candidate. 
A report in The Wall Street Journal Wednesday said several companies including General Electric Co.'s (GE) GE Capital unit, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA, BRKB) and Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) have been named as potential buyers for Enron. 
Ms. Coale said the takeover speculation was ""unwarranted"" and has surfaced each time Enron shares faltered. 
""It would be very unusual ... for a company to be interested in a takeover (of Enron) given the uncertainty of the SEC inquiry. Why add that uncertainty to your portfolio?"" she said. 
Furthermore, Ms. Coale said, it might be difficult for a company such as Shell to clear regulatory hurdles because it already operates a substantial energy trading business. 
Commerzbank's Mr. Meade also discounted the takeover speculation. He likened such a deal to the acquisition of a financial-service company. 
""You are buying a human-capital-based business. You have to make sure you're not going to loose all your people,"" he said. ""It's a trickier acquisition."" 
But not everyone thinks the takeover speculation is implausible. Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John Hancock Value Funds, said Shell and Enron are ""neighbors"", and Shell has looked at Enron ""on and off."" 
Still, he said that if there is a buyer for Enron, the company would want to do it sooner rather than later in order not to risk damaging Enron's leading market position. 
Some marketwatchers said at least some of the pressure on Enron shares in recent trading sessions has come from mutual funds liquidating their positions to avoid having the company's name appear among their holdings in their annual reports. 
Despite the rise in Enron shares Wednesday, there remains a significant amount of uncertainty about the stock. 
In addition to the pending SEC inquiry and the lingering credit concerns, attention also is being paid to their effect on Enron's trading business. While several trading counterparties have said that they are watching the situation closely, at least one, Entergy Corp. (ETR), is said to be trimming its exposure to Enron. 
The New York Mercantile Exchange also plans to use Enron's weakness to recapture part of the over-the-counter energy derivative market by offering its own clearing services and trading tools for the natural gas market.

I have attached a ""technical risk template"" that should serve as an outline for the presentation. You may also want to discuss some of the major commercial terms and conditions that are driving schedule, performance, and cost.

You don't need to address each technical risk item in infinite detail, but we should focus on the key items of scope definition, construction execution, and contractor analysis that can impact value.  The objective is to identify what we need to pay attention to as we begin to ramp up the capital expenditure.  Defining and managing construction risk has become a popular topic given the status of the Dabhol and Cuiba projects.

We also need to take some time to discuss/settle the outstanding EE&CC invoice (now EEOS).   I would like to agree a payment number and move on down the road with EEOS.

-	Power strike set for March 16 in Mexico City

Some 35,000 members of the Mexican Union of Electrical Workers plan to strike the Mexico City Electric Company on Friday, March 16th at 12 Noon. The union is demanding a 29 percent salary increase and the company is offering nothing. The two sides are not even talking. The union is concerned that the government may try to force the electrical workers to stay on their jobs or bring in replacements. The union is also opposed to the privatization of the electric company and its leader has charged that privatization would bring higher electric rates to meet the profit demands of foreign investors. The company principally provides electrical service to Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Morelos, Hidalgo and Puebla. It may be prudent to begin planning for possible power shortages in these regions.

MEXICO'S NATURAL GAS: WHY HASN'T A SPOT MARKET DEVELOPED?
Current regulation allows Mexico to develop a transparent import and export spot market; however, despite the reform, Pemex continues to be the key player, not only supplying natural gas but also controlling sales contracts with most users. The key question is, why hasn't the spot market developed? Some of the reasons are:

* flaw in the current price methodology

* a lack of price transparency in transportation

* price deals offered by Pemex

I only spent an hour on this.  However, I would pass.  This would keep a lot of orig/tech/finance people employed for a while in order to manage it and then work off the pieces.  

This looks like a fairly impressive private asset company - they appear to be good developers, acquirers, etc.  They even say that they that restructured 8 of their PPA's - presumably they restructured the ones that make sense - further reduces our restructuring proposition.  

To me, the QF optionality goes like this:  
- If you have a high-variable cost QF that operates as a baseload facility, the math works to shut it down or convert to a peaking PPA when the market is low.  
- If the market is high, you have an easy-to-develop expansion.

Problem is, their assets appear to have low variable costs (coal and new gas) so the restructuring play does not jump out at me
...and we are bearish on development

At PV18, this could look like a good diversified low risk business - superior to most of our regulated businesses and most of our international businesses, but I think it would be real tough to get returns >30%.  Besides, I think someone will pay more for it.  Over half the net MW is new 7FA capacity - attractive to Calpine and the Calpine wanabees.   This is actually a cheap way for an IPP to hit its MW growth targets without blowing their brains out in the spot market.  

Someone should pay up - not us.   

Question: Did we form qf teams in the east and west because of the success of East Coast Power?  Was that success largely driven by the fact that we bought it cheap?  Or did we innovatively restructure the PPA?  If we brought innovative financing to the deal, isn't that the same as buying it cheap?  Was East Coast Power a formal auction or was it a negotiated deal? 

I can dig into this some more if you'd like.  Our internal model would be my next step.  Let me know.

PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates
The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:
?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.
?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.
?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.
?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. 
?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.
?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. 
?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.
?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.
""This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,"" said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  ""The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.""
This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

""I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

""It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

""I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint.""

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility 
JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer
Saturday, September 15, 2001 
?2001 Associated Press 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL>
(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 
The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 
As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 
But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 
""We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor,"" said President Pro Tem John Burton. ""It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation."" 
The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 
Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 
The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. 
""I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness,"" Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. ""Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done."" 
The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 
The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 
It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 
While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 
Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 
The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 
The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 
""Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance,"" said Davis.

If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.

2686,"Though announced yesterday that Davis and the Assembly Democratic leadership had cut a deal on an MOU for Edison, considerable uncertainty remains:

The legislative language describing ""the deal"" still has not been released. (We'll get the details out just as soon as they are available.)
Of the provisions rumored to be in the deal, Burton (Democratic leader in the Senate) has said publicly that spreading the utility undercollection over customers 20 KW and higher is a ""nonstarter in the Senate"".  (The Senate bill forces 500 KW-and-above customers to pay for Edison's undercollection (which amounts to about 3600 customers behind Edison.  Wall Street has said that 3600 customers is insufficient to securitize the undercollection.).
Unless the costs are spread across 20 KW-and-above customers, business is likely to oppose the bill strongly.
Business may also oppose the bill if it doesn't provide for ""meaningful"" Direct Access and self-gen, but at this point business seems to care more about spreading the undercollection than Direct Access.
There is no indication yet that Davis and the Democratic leadership in the Assembly have convinced a majority of Assembly Democracts to vote for the deal; but Davis is pushing very hard and the assumption is that he'll get the votes in the Assembly if he continues to push.
However, given Burton's comments, it's unclear whether the Senate goes along, even if Davis manages to push something through the Assembly.  But if Davis and the Assembly want it badly enough, the likelihood is that they will pass a bill that meets Burton's requirements and that Burton will move through the Senate.
Bryson, CEO of Edison, has said publicly that he doesn't know whether the deal will make Edison solvent.
Consumer groups are strongly opposed to any deal for Edison, saying 1) bankruptcy's the best answer and 2) they will run ""the Mother of all ballot initiatives"" to roll back any ""bailout.""
As of 1:06 PM CDT, PCG is trading at 16.47 (down 0.07); Edison's trading at 13.94 (down 0.07).

With respect to the 15 million of increased VAR that the Board allocated to 
Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following:

1.  5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES's positions from 
the Wholesale gas and power groups (This has already been done).

2.  Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the 
trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).

3.  With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the 
""Cross Commodity Trading Group"" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and 
use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only 
employee).  This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we 
need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading 
groups staying within their VAR limits).  However, I do see the need for a 
true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability 
trades accross the commodities that we trade.  This structure may help to 
start us down this path.

Please let me know what you think.

2738,"Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

Dear Mr. Lay,
 
Recently I received notice that Enron will no  longer provide electric service for my residence ""as a result of continued  uncertainty in this market, as well as a lack of clarity on the future of direct  access."" I find this very disappointing and would like Enron to re-consider  this decision.
 
I am a strong believer in the free market system  and, in part, it was for this reason that I chose Enron as my electric  service provider several years ago when the market in California was  deregulated. I also chose Enron because of my knowledge of your company,  its leadership and the strategic direction you have provided.
 
Never was there a time in the marketing  of electric service to the State of California for a company such as  Enron to exhibit long range thinking & leadership. This is an opportunity  for Enron to show commitment and staying power in a market  that has ""radically changed"" and lacking in clarity.
 
I recognize it is not an easy decision to change a  decision that has already been made. However, I also consider you a risk  taking, strong and capable leader who wants to make the right decision for  its ultimate customers in spite of  short term political decisions (that  will get changed) by Governor Davis.

Tepco Chief Braces For Lower Power Demand From Ind Users


TOKYO (Nikkei)--Terrorist attacks and the subsequent fall in U.S. stock
prices have diminished the confidence of Japanese businesses and
investors, who were already reeling from a global slowdown.

In an interview with The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Nobuya Minami, president
of Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501), said he is prepared to see power
demand from large-lot users weakening amid the slumping economy.
Excerpts follow:

Q: How do you view the stock price plunge that has occurred in the
aftermath of terrorist attacks in the U.S.?

A: Japanese stock prices were falling before the attacks, suggesting
that prices may have been inflated to begin with. I think stock prices
may fall further because it's inevitable that companies will collapse as
financial institutions expedite disposal of bad loans.

Q: What's your outlook on the economy and demand for electricity?

A: It's still too early to assess the true economic impact of the
terrorist attacks, but it will be a considerable blow to the sluggish
Japanese economy. The so-called ""hollowing out"" of the Japanese
manufacturing industry is likely to gather speed as more producers
transfer their factories to China and other Asian countries.

Consumption of electricity was high this summer, but volume customers
are using less because industrial activities continue to slump. I expect
consumption among volume users will begin rising once the bad debt
liquidation phase has passed.

Q: Do you have concerns about rising oil prices given the situation in
the Middle East.

A: Japan depends less on oil now than we did in the 1970s, when there
was a major oil crisis. Our energy sources are more diverse and our oil
reserve system is in good shape. There may be price hikes, but the
impact will be much smaller this time.

Q: Will Tokyo Electric reduce capital investment further?

A: We decided last spring to keep our annual capital investment under
900 billion yen on average for the next three years. That's about 40%
lower than our capital spending during peak times. We'll make further
adjustments if necessary when we create a new capital investment plan
next spring.

Q: While most companies are struggling, Tokyo Electric is expected to
post its highest group net profit since it began reporting group
earnings in fiscal 1994. There are increasing calls to lower electricity
charges, aren't there?

A: We plan to lower the charges in the medium to long term.

Q: What do you say to the view that demand for electricity is unlikely
to rise in the long term, given rising environmental awareness among
Japanese consumers?

A: I think an increasing number of environmentally conscious people will
cut consumption as they pursue a life that's less driven by consumption.
Electric companies have to develop new revenue sources, such as energy
conservation consulting.

Q: In the U.S. and Europe, many utility companies handle both
electricity and gas. Do you think Japanese electric companies will do
the same?

A: As deregulation advances, the boundaries between electricity, gas and
oil industries in Japan will probably become more blurred. Tokyo
Electric has to become a more comprehensive company that can deliver
whatever energy the market demands.

Power deregulation fails to connect
New entrants impeded by high up-front costs; some foreign firms prefer
trading or other niches

NATSUKO SEGAWA
Staff writer



Ennet Corp., an independent power provider established by the NTT group
and others, operates this power plant, which started up in July, in
Ibaraki Prefecture.


Some 18 months after the partial deregulation of the electricity market,
new entrants are beginning to wonder if they really are facing free and
fair competition for the potentially huge profits. Meanwhile, some
foreign firms are utilizing their advantages, such as expertise in
power-related financial trading, to carve out new niches unexplored by
Japan's tradition-bound regional power utilities.

Since March 2000, when the government revised the Electricity Utilities
Industry Law to allow free entry to the retail market for large-lot
users, nine domestic companies have notified the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry of their plans to enter the market. While not yet
submitting such notifications, at least three foreign firms - Enron
Japan Corp., InterGen (HK) Ltd. and El Paso Japan Co. - have started
feasibility studies or negotiations with potential clients.

In spite of the sluggish economy, the utility business appeared to be a
promising field because of its huge potential: Full-scale deregulation
will give access to a market worth around 15 trillion yen ($127 billion)
a year, making Japan the world's second-largest electricity market.
Further, the market keeps growing at a rate of 1-2% a year. So even when
just 30% of the market was opened, there was a rush of new entrants.

But their expectations have been largely disappointed. According to an
estimate by the Trade Ministry, new entrants have only a 0.2% share of
the market. The difficulty in constructing new power plants, high
transmission costs and an uncertain deregulation schedule are slowing
new participants' expansion of business.

Enron, which opened a Tokyo office in July last year, is mounting an
active challenge to Japan's regulations and traditional business
customs. In May, its local unit released proposals on electricity reform
via the Internet, which say that if the Japanese electricity market had
introduced fair competition and reduced electricity costs to the level
of the U.S., large-lot customers could have cut their electricity costs
by around 4 trillion yen a year.

Nicholas O'Day, vice president of Enron Japan, does not try to hide his
irritation at the slow progress of the deregulation process and
indicates that strong government leadership is needed to enforce further
reform. Especially, Enron and other new entrants want to see sharp
reductions in the transmission fees charged to independent power
providers by the utilities for access to their transmission lines.

Satoshi Abe, senior analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research, said: ""Most
clients in the deregulated market are industrial customers that already
enjoy low electricity costs amounting to 12 yen per kilowatt-hour. The
average generating cost is 7 yen per kilowatt-hour, and new entrants pay
around 4-5 yen per kilowatt-hour to utilities in transmission charges
and other fees. So there's no room for profit.""

However, Hiroshi Araki, manager of corporate planning at Tokyo Electric
Power Co. (Tepco), argued, ""We face the same cost when we use our own
transmission lines, so we're competing on an equal footing with the new
entrants.""

Another disappointment for the new suppliers was the difficulty of
obtaining additional electricity to sell. As building a power plant
requires an initial investment of at least 10 billion yen, most new
entrants planned to buy excess electricity from manufacturers who have
their own power generators and resell it.

But the plan soon ran into difficulties. ""We could procure only 50-60%
of the electricity we needed, and we were forced to revise our business
model,"" said Tsutomu Takeda, vice president of Ennet Corp., an
independent power provider set up by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. group and others. To secure supplies for its main customer, the
NTT group, Ennet started operating a power plant in Ibaraki Prefecture
in July and plans three more in Chiba and Kyoto prefectures by autumn
2003.

For the foreign entrants, the situation is even more severe as they have
to build relationships with customers and find suitable sites to build
power plants from scratch. Earlier this year, two U.S. power companies,
El Paso and InterGen, opened branches in Tokyo, but they say they are
just waiting and watching developments for now.

Stephen Del Regno, president of El Paso Japan, compared the situation
here to that of South Korea, which is also deregulating. ""In South
Korea, land and labor costs are also very high, but it is still more
than 50% cheaper to build a power plant there.""

Keys Curry, head representative at InterGen, said: ""The environmental
impact assessment process is quite long in Japan. So if you want to
build a large power plant, it takes at least six years. Who can propose
to clients to buy electricity that will be provided six years later?""

Financial products

Seeing these difficulties, some foreign companies chose to start by
offering financial products hedging risk, and follow by trading
electricity or futures contracts. Enron is the forerunner in the field,
offering weather derivatives and other such products. The local unit of
a major U.S. brokerage has staged experimental futures trading of
electricity, gathering around 20 participants in March and May. Both
have power plants in the U.S., but here they are leaving actual
generation until later.

what must be the most difficult situation that you or anyone else could
imagine . I just wanted you to know that I think you are being treated very
unfairly by the media. We all know that the media only gets half the story
right and that the half they get right is not often reported. I appreciate
all that you and Enron have done for our city. I believe that over time when
all the pundits are done with the Enron story and the reality of your
contribution to the quality of life in Houston is fully understood there
will be a better story to tell. In the meantime if there is anything I can

Earlier this year when the decision was made to purchase our new GV aircraft, 
we agreed to move forward with plans to sell one of our Falcon 900B's by 
year-end.

This allows for Aviation to maintain a six aircraft domestic fleet, once the 
GV is delivered and operational at the beginning of the 2nd quarter of next 
year.  Our '01 budget forecast is based on this assumption.

A year-end sale avoids ad valorem tax issues.  It reduces our fleet to five 
during the 1st quarter, which is also the limit that we can operate aircraft, 
i.e., several pilots unavailable (at GV flight training during this period).

Gary Fitch advises that Jeff and Joe do not have a preference on which 
aircraft to sell.  Gary prefers selling the Falcon 900B (#N5733), since it 
has only one lavatory.  The aircraft is 12 years old, in excellent condition, 
and has a market value of $20-22 million (lease buy-out of $19 million).

With your concurrence, we will contract with an aircraft broker and place the 
Falcon on the market.

Bill",Ken Gary Fitch Jeff Joe Gary,N5733 $20-22 million $19 million,Falcon Aviation
2823,"Hi Ken,

I read with interest today about Enron on your corporate web site and your
recognition as one of the top U.S. CEOs. Such success usually results from a
history of strong business and customer relationships. With this in mind, I
felt compelled to bring my one and only experience with Enron to your
attention.

I am President, CEO of Xign Corporation located in Pleasanton, CA.  Our
company is developing software for electronic payments.  Our board of
directors includes Charles Schwab and Bob Kimmitt (former U.S. Ambassador to
Germany and President of Commerce One).

Our company signed an intent last June with Enron to sublease an office
building.  My team worked in good faith with Enron people for 5 months
waiting for a draft lease.  During this period we were delayed time and
again by ""lack of legal resources"" to complete the contract.  Last month we
were told that Enron still wanted to lease the space, but the vacancy would
be delayed one month (from the original October 15th date).  Two weeks ago
we were told that a November date was at risk and the lease could not be
signed.

This week the Enron representative told us (1) there is no occupancy date
that can be established and (2) Enron is not willing or interested in
telling us when we they can set a date.  End of conversation.

Our company has pursued this matter for six months with assurances by Enron
of their intention to move forward in good faith.  My company is now down to
100 days in our current lease in a market with very little available space.
This will materially effect our operation and our shareholders.  Enron did
not legally commit to the lease. But continued reassurances of the intent to
sign the lease, misled us.  We won't make a similar mistake in the future.

We all operate as members of a business community.  I'm sure my experience
with Enron is not reflective of your organization as a whole. I would
certainly appreciate if you could have someone look into this matter and
let us know if there might be a solution to this situation that works well
for all parties.

Thank you very much,

Dear John:

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
distant future.

Warm regards,

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Previous Session's Best Performing Alert

One of Friday's Before the Bell Alerts Emulex Corp. (EMLX) gained=20
17 points after our alert. RealTimeTraders.com offers free=20
real-time stock alerts throughout the day. Why pay for=20
chat rooms and stock pickers for old news?



Morning Watch List

This section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days.=20
Click here for this morning's Watch List Stocks:=20
http://www.realtimetraders.com/realtimetraders/marketinfo/watchlist.asp



Beyond The Numbers

Are the markets ready for a rally?

Whether the markets are ready for a bounce or a sustainable rally is a topi=
c=20
that can probably be argued for a long time to come. Some may argue the=20
fundamentals may or may not be in place for a reversal. While others may=20
argue the markets are due for a bounce because of the oversold condition.=
=20
Then there are those few, including RealTimeTraders.com who believe it's a=
=20
good idea not to fight the markets and simply go with the flow.

Important factors may be coming together for a move up

Notice, our heading states =01&a move up=018 rather than a rally. Along wit=
h a few=20
market analysts we are not so sure this move up will be a definite reversal=
=20
or a temporary bounce that many traders are looking for in next few session=
s.=20
Last week we pointed out that Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan finally ga=
ve=20
the markets what they had been anticipating. His favorable comments were=20
interpreted to be a sign of possible lowering of interest rates to help the=
=20
economy from slowing down to undesirable growth levels.

Last Friday Labor Department announced the November employment numbers were=
=20
below the consensus estimates. Over the weekend we learned that Iraq will b=
e=20
back in the crude oil market. If Iraq's crude comes online, that may furthe=
r=20
pressure the crude oil prices, (which is in the best interest of US=20
consumers). The fact this election drama is also getting close to an end is=
=20
also a positive for the markets. All the above facts coupled with the usual=
=20
year end rally (better known as Santa Claus rally) may set the stage for a=
=20
meaningful move up in the last few weeks of the year 2000.=20

Economic slowdown may impact future earnings

Last week some of the biggest and well-known names warned their upcoming=20
quarterly earnings will fall short of Wall Street=01,s expectations. Despit=
e the=20
earnings warnings, markets have started to rally on the FED Chairman=01,s=
=20
comments about possibly lowering interest rates to stimulate or stop the=20
economy from slowing down. While lower rates are expected to help the marke=
ts=20
move higher, it is important to note that corporate earnings will not=20
immediately start to move higher. Given that, we believe markets are likely=
=20
to move in a range for some time before starting to pick up pace. Moreover,=
=20
unlike the past when dot com businesses rocketed higher and higher despite=
=20
losing more money, stock prices in the future will depend a lot on the=20
companies future earnings.=20
<br><br>
We encourage our readers to take a closer look at companies' earnings power=
=20
and their position within the sector. What we mean by that is, it is a good=
=20
idea to stay with the leaders in each sector rather than any stock that is=
=20
moving higher, a good example of that is Applied Materials (AMAT) within th=
e=20
semiconductor sector. Applied Materials is the strongest stock in the=20
Semiconductor equipment world, and as such it has always produced steady an=
d=20
predictable earnings.



Sector Analysis

Healthcare and Insurance related Stocks continue to attract  money

Once again we like to stay with stocks that are outperforming the broad=20
market. Past few months we have been pointing out health and food related=
=20
stocks that are among the defensive stocks that has caught the interest of=
=20
investors. We at RealTimeTraders.com believe the healthcare and insurance=
=20
related stocks will continue to move higher regardless of the possibility o=
f=20
technology stocks coming back into the spotlight. Some of the stocks that a=
re=20
worth mentioning are United Healthcare (UNH) has been hovering around its=
=20
52-week high for the past few weeks. Friday the stock closed at a new 52-we=
ek=20
on average volume. Allstate Corp. (ALL) closed at a new 52-week high on=20
Friday for the fourth consecutive day. Oxford Healthcare (OXHP) has set=20
series of new highs since we started to alert our readers to this stock bac=
k=20
in May 2000. We continue to see positive money flow into this stock.=20




Economic Reports & Bond Markets

This week markets will start out with a light schedule of economic reports.=
=20
However, as the week heads towards the end markets will face some important=
=20
economic reports that will help economist determine the direction and the=
=20
strength of the economy. Monday wholesale inventory for the month of Octobe=
r=20
is scheduled to be released at 10:00 AM. Analysts expect the inventory to=

 the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector index was testing an important resis=

The STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS

The NASDAQ and S&P 500 were lower overnight as selling pressure
continues due to weakness in technology stocks. Both the Nasdaq and
June S&P 500 have broken out below this spring's uptrend lines
thereby increasing the odds that short-term tops have been posted.
Momentum indicators have also turned bearish warning traders and
investors alike that additional weakness into early-June appears
likely. Meanwhile, the Dow closed modestly higher on Tuesday due to
light short covering ahead of the close. Nevertheless, the recent
breakout below this spring's uptrend line that crosses near 11,100
signaled that a top has been posted. If the decline off last week's
high continues, May's reaction low crossing at 10,774.10 is the Dow's
next target.

European markets were lower in overnight trading due to spillover
pressure from Tuesday's poor performance on Wall Street and ongoing
weakness in the euro. The UK FTSE-100 was down 53.90 points at
5810.00 while the German DAX-30 was down 43.98 points at 6067.35 as
of 11:00 BST.

The Nikkei closed sharply lower overnight as it broke out below May's
reaction low crossing at 13,694 to renew its decline off May's high.
The door is open for additional weakness with the 38% retracement
level of this spring's rally crossing at 13,363 being the next likely
downside target later this spring. Momentum indicators remain bearish
signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible. The
overnight sell off was triggered by a downgrade of high-tech stocks
by analysts. The Nikkei closed down 2% or 280.54 points to 13,493.35.

INTEREST RATES

June bonds opened higher overnight as they consolidated some of
Tuesday's losses. June bonds may continue to drift sideways ahead of
Friday's employment report amidst a lack of fresh economic news to
trade off of. Nevertheless, momentum indicators remain bearish
warning traders that a test of May's reaction low crossing at 98-24
is still a potential target later this spring. If this support level
gives way, weekly fib support crossing at 98-07 is a target.

The German bond market or Bunds were lower overnight in response to
the latest money supply figures for the euro-zone. The annual rate of
M3 growth in April was 4.7% compared with 4.6% in March. The June
Bunds were last down 0.07 at 106.15.

Japanese government bond markets were slightly higher overnight but
remains locked within a narrow trading range. Light support came from
weakness in the Nikkei. The lead June 10-year JGB futures closed at
140.19 yen, up 0.11 while the yield on the benchmark No. 231 June
10-year cash bond stood at 1.280%, unchanged as of 1520 JT.

The ENERGY MARKETS were mostly higher in overnight trading due to
light short covering as the products consolidated some of Tuesday's
losses. Additional support came from concerns over Iraq's threats to
curtail oil exports. This week's API inventory data review is as
follows. Crude oil and unleaded gasoline stocks are expected to have
risen 1.2 million barrels last week, while distillate stocks are
anticipated to have climbed 0.6 million barrels. Refinery operations
are seen unchanged to up 0.55 percentage points of capacity.

July crude oil was higher overnight as it continues to rebound off
last Friday's low on Iraq output concerns. However, July continues to
consolidate below broken trendline support crossing near 29.25. It
would take multiple closes above this broken support level to temper
the near-term bearish outlook in July crude. Until then, the rebound
appears to be corrective as the door has been open for sideways to
lower prices into early-June. Momentum indicators are bearish
signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible. If July's
decline resumes, the reaction lows at 28.03 then 27.25 are July's
next targets.

July heating oil was higher overnight as it is working on an inside
day to consolidate some of Tuesday's loss. A higher close during the
day session would leave Tuesday's key reversal down unconfirmed. If
the decline continues, a test of this spring's uptrend line crossing
near 77.30 is July's next target. Multiple closes below this uptrend
line are needed to confirm a top and trend change has taken place.
Momentum indicators are bearish warning bulls that additional
weakness is possible.

July unleaded gas is working on an inside day in overnight trading
due to light short covering. Nevertheless, the setback from last
week's high has turned momentum indicators bearish signaling that
additional weakness into early-June is possible. If the decline
continues, trendline support crossing near 93.25 is July's next
target.

July Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight as it extends this
spring's decline. Tuesday's breakout below last October's low
crossing at 3.86 has opened the door for a possible test of fib
support crossing at 3.64 later this spring. The daily ADX (a
trend-following indicator) remains in a bearish modes signaling that
additional weakness near-term is possible. However, momentum
indicators have become extremely oversold warning bears to use
caution as a low might be near.

CURRENCIES

The June Euro was lower overnight but is working on an inside day as
it consolidates above last November's low crossing at 84.73. If the
decline resumes, a test of last October's lows crossing at 83.53 is
possible later this spring. The daily ADX (a trend-following
indicator) has entered a bearish trend mode signaling that sideways
to lower prices are possible into early- June.

The June British Pound was slightly lower, overnight as it
consolidates some of Tuesday's gains. Momentum indicators are turning
neutral to bullish following the rebound off last week's low, which
suggests that a broad double bottom might be in place. Nevertheless,
multiple closes below trading range support crossing at 1.4112 would
open the door for a possible test of last fall's low at 1.4052 later
this spring.

The June Swiss Franc was lower in overnight trading as it is working
on an inside day. June continues to consolidate above the contract
low crossing at .5603. Multiple closes below this support level would
renew this spring's decline while opening the door for a possible
test of weekly support crossing at .5488 later this year. Momentum
indicators are bearish but becoming oversold warning traders to use
caution as a broad double bottom might be forming.

The June Canadian Dollar was lower overnight due to light profit
taking and may be forming a possible downside reversal. However, it
will take multiple closes above .6548 or below .6425 to clear up
near-term direction in the market. Momentum indicators are turning
neutral to bullish hinting that a minor low might be in or near.

The June Japanese Yen was lower in narrow trading overnight but
remains below trading range resistance that crosses at .8339. Closes
above.8433 are needed to confirm an upside breakout of this spring's
trading range. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that
additional gains near-term are possible.

PRECIOUS METALS

August comex gold was lower overnight as it extends its decline off
last week's spike high due to long-liquidation. Stochastics and RSI
are bearish signaling that additional weakness into June is likely.
This week's breakout below broken resistance crossing at 276.20 has
opened the door for a test of trendline support crossing near 271.70
later this spring.

July silver was lower overnight and is below trading range resistance
crossing at 4.525. Multiple closes below 4.525 would signal that
May's short covering rally has likely come to an end. Momentum
indicators are turning neutral to bearish hinting that a short-term
top has likely been posted.

July copper was slightly higher overnight due to light short covering
following Tuesday's sharp decline. Upside potential during the day
session appears limited as the tone of the market has turned
decidedly bearish following Tuesday's sell-off. Momentum indicators
are turning bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices into
early-June appears likely. If the decline continues, May's low at
74.75 is July's next target.

GRAINS

July corn was steady overnight as it consolidates below weekly
support crossing at 1.91 1/2. Multiple closes below this key support
level are needed to confirm a breakout thereby opening the door for a
possible test of last summer's low crossing at 1.74 1/2 later this
year. Tuesday's planting intentions report showed that 95% of this
year's corn crop is in the ground compared with the five-year average
of 92%. The crop conditions report showed that 80% of the corn has
emerged with 5% poor, 25% fair, and 70% good- excellent. Yesterday's
export inspection report came in at 32.383 million bushels, which was
above the previous week's level but is still below the pace needed to
meet the latest USDA export projection. Traders are now looking for
the USDA to lower its export projection in the June supply/demand
report, which would only add to the bearish carryout level for
2001-02. Early calls are for July corn to open steady this morning.

July wheat was higher in overnight trading as last week's cool-wet
conditions have improved winter wheat conditions slightly. However,
the latest export inspection report continued to show slow export
demand, which have off set supply concerns this spring. It would take
multiple closes above broken support crossing at 2.65 to temper the
near term bearish outlook in July wheat. Until then, the door remains
open for a test of weekly gap support crossing at 2.56 then the
long-term pivot level at 2.50 later this spring. Early calls are for
July wheat to open 2 to 2 3/4 cents higher this morning.

SOYBEAN COMPEX

July soybeans were fractionally higher in overnight trading due to
short covering following Tuesday's breakout below this spring's
uptrend line. The latest planting progress report showed that 70% of
the bean crop has been planted, which is 6 points above the five-year
average. While a short covering bounce is possible during the day
session on Wednesday, odds now appears as though last Friday's high
marked a double top on the daily chart. Momentum indicators are
turning bearish from overbought positions signaling that sideways to
lower prices into early-June appear likely. Early calls are for July
soybeans to open steady to a 1/4 of a cent higher this morning.

July soybean meal was higher overnight due to short covering
following Tuesday's trendline breakout. Multiple closes below
trendline support crossing near 162.60 are needed to confirm this
week's breakout. At the same time, momentum indicators are turning
bearish from overbought conditions thereby increasing the odds that a
short-term top has likely been posted. Early calls are for July
soybean meal to open 20 to 50-cents higher this morning.

LIVESTOCK

June hogs closed sharply higher on Tuesday following last Friday's
announcement by the USDA that the government was easing its ban on
livestock and uncooked meat from the EU. Today's rally strongly
suggests that last week's lows marked a double bottom with the
early-May lows, which coincided with the 38% retracement level of the
2000-01 rally. Momentum indicators are turning neutral to bullish
with today's rally signaling that sideways to higher prices into
early-June are possible.

August cattle closed higher on Tuesday and above the 75% retracement
level of this year's decline crossing at 73.83. Today's rally renewed
May's advance while opening the door for a likely test of January's
high crossing at 75.00 later this spring. Momentum indicators have
become overbought but remain bullish signaling that additional gains
near-term are possible.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee posted an inside day with a slightly lower
close as it consolidated some of last Friday's losses. The door
remains open for a test of April's low crossing at 58.80. Closes
below this support level would renew this year's decline and set the
stage for a possible test of long-term support crossing at 51.70
later this year.

July cocoa closed lower on Tuesday following last Friday's gap down,
which signaled that a broad double top has been posted. Momentum
indicators have turned bearish signaling that additional weakness
into early-June is likely. I would not be surprised to see a short
covering bounce on Wednesday as July might try and consolidate some
of its recent losses.

July sugar closed sharply lower on Tuesday and below trading range
support crossing at 879. Multiple closes below 879 are needed to
confirm today's breakout and trend change. Stochastics and RSI are
bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices near-term are
possible. I would not be surprised to see a short covering bounce on
Wednesday as July might try and test broken support before extending
its decline.

July cotton posted an upside reversal on Tuesday due to light short
covering. Early session weakness led to a spike below psychological
support crossing at 40-cents. Multiple closes below the 40-cent
support level could lead to an eventual test of the 1986 low crossing
at 29.50 cents. If last Friday's gap crossing at 42.15 is filled this
week, it would increase the odds that the gap was an exhaustion gap,
which is associated with a market that is bottoming.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 29, 2001--Wamex Holdings Inc. (OTC:WAMX -

an advance towards the funding it needs to get its Internet Trading System

Macrocom Investors, LLC, a New York financial firm, has agreed in
principle to initial financing in the amount of $500,000, with the
prospect of further investment when due diligence is completed, according
to Sascha Mundstein, Wamex CEO.

""The funding is contingent on Macrocom's satisfaction that the Internet
Trading System software really works, and we know that it does -- it has
been demonstrated,"" Mundstein said.

The Wamex CEO expressed the hope that this financial boost signals major
progress toward the total recovery of Wamex, which he has been working to
achieve since taking over the company late in 2000.  Wamex is 50% partner
in a joint venture with Trat.net Ltd. and CSCO Ltd., officially named

international access to a direct, online, one-on-one, ""no middleman""
trading facility, wherein third party price manipulation and distortion
may be greatly reduced or eliminated.

day the investment business begins a radical change for the better,""
Mundstein said.

The STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS

The NASDAQ and S&P 500 were lower overnight following Thursday's
minor short covering bounces. Ongoing weakness in high-tech stocks
amidst earnings concerns due to a continued slowing of the U.S.
economy leaves the doors open for additional weakness near-term.
Traders will be paying close attention to this morning's unemployment
report for further signs of a slowing economy. Meanwhile, the Dow's
short covering bounce and mid-range close on Thursday leaves the door
open for sideways to lower prices into early-June. If the decline off
last week's high continues, May's reaction low crossing at 10,774.10
is the Dow's next target.

European markets were lower in overnight trading as they took their
lead from U.S. equity markets, which were also lower overnight.
Losses were tempered by the latest Euro-zone March retail sales
report that showed overall sales for the year are up 1.6% on the
year. However, retail sales were down 0.4% on the month. Retail sales
in all sectors were weak compared to February's figures. The UK FTSE-
100 was down 13.50 points at 5782.60 while the German DAX-30 was down
37.58 points at 6085.68 as of 11:06 BST.

The Nikkei was nearly steady overnight as traders were reluctant to
take a major position ahead of the weekend and the U.S. May
unemployment report due out this morning. A modest rebound in
high-tech stocks, which have taken a beating in recent days, tempered
some of the overnight losses. Nevertheless, the Nikkei posted a
second close below the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally
that crosses at 13,363. This week's breakout has opened the door for
a possible test of the 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995 later
this year. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that
additional weakness near-term is possible. The Nikkei closed down
0.30 points to 13,261.84.

INTEREST RATES

September bonds were slightly higher overnight as it extended
Thursday's short covering gains. However, trading was subdued ahead
of the release of May's unemployment report later this morning.
Momentum indicators are turning bullish following Thursday's rally
signaling that sideways to higher prices into early- June are
possible. However, it will take multiple closes above this spring's
downtrend line crossing near 100-00 before a bottom can be confirmed.

The German bond market or Bunds were higher overnight following the
release of the euro-zone retail sales report that showed overall
sales are up 1.6% on the year. Additional support came from light
short covering ahead of the release of the U.S. non-farm payroll and
the National Association of Purchasing Management data due to be
released later this morning. The June Bunds were last up 0.42 at
106.47.

Japanese government bond markets declined slightly overnight due to
light profit taking ahead of the weekend. The lead June 10-year JGB
futures closed at 140.52 yen, down 0.07 while the yield on the
benchmark No. 231 June 10-year cash bond stood at 1.245%, up 0.005 as
of 1515 JT.

The ENERGY MARKETS were mostly lower in overnight trading with the
exception of unleaded gas. Trading was rather subdued after
Thursday's wild price action. The markets are looking ahead to next
week's OPEC meeting in Vienna where they will decide whether or not
to raise crude oil output or keep it unchanged. Their decision will
depend on Iraq's implementation of its threats to stop oil exports in
case the U.N. Security Council adopts the so-called ""smart
sanctions"".

July crude oil was lower overnight as it is working on a possible
inside day. July is challenging the 38% retracement level of this
year's rally crossing at 28.26. Multiple closes below this support
level and last week's low at 28.10 would open the door for a
larger-degree decline ahead of next week's OPEC meeting. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
possible.

July heating oil was lower overnight as it is working on a possible
inside day. A second close below this spring's uptrend line crossing
near 77.60 would confirm a top and trend change has taken place. If a
trendline breakout is confirmed, May's reaction low crossing at 74.55
is July's next target. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that
additional weakness is possible.

July unleaded gas was slightly higher due to light short covering
overnight following Thursday's high-range close. A higher close
during the day session would increase the odds that Thursday's spike
below May's reaction low crossing at 91.20 might have marked a double
bottom. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional
weakness into early-June is possible.

July Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight following Thursday's
downside reversal and is below last October's low crossing at 3.86.
Multiple closes below this week's low crossing at 3.67 would open the
door for a possible test of fib support crossing at 3.64 later this
month. Ongoing seasonal weakness and the replenishing of natural gas
inventory supplies is expected to keep downside pressure on the
natural gas market into early-summer. The daily ADX (a
trend-following indicator) remains in a bearish modes signaling that
additional weakness near-term is possible.

CURRENCIES

The September Euro is working on a possible inside day but was
slightly lower overnight following Thursday's breakout into new lows
for the year. If the decline continues, a test of last October's lows
crossing at 83.77 is possible later this month. The daily ADX (a
trend-following indicator) is bearish signaling that sideways to
lower prices are possible into early-June are possible.

The September British Pound opened modestly higher overnight due to
light short covering as it consolidated some of Thursday's losses. A
higher close during the day session would increase the odds that
Thursday's decline was only a minor setback leaving the door open for
additional short covering off last week's low. Momentum indicators
are turning neutral to bullish, which suggests that sideways to
higher prices into early-June are possible. If the rebound off last
week's low resumes, trendline resistance crossing near 1.4290 is
September's next target.

The September Swiss Franc opened lower in overnight trading following
Thursday's breakout into new contract lows. The recent breakout below
last October's low crossing at .5643 has opening the door for a test
of weekly support crossing at .5488 later this month. The ADX (a
trend-following indicator) has entered a bearish trend mode signaling
that additional weakness during June is possible.

The September Canadian Dollar was higher overnight thereby confirming
Thursday's upside reversal. The late-week rebound has set the stage
for a test of May's high crossing at .6541. Multiple closes above
this resistance level are needed to renew this spring's rally.
Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices during the first half of June are possible.

The September Japanese Yen was higher overnight as it extended
Thursday's rally, which confirmed an upside breakout of this spring's
trading range. If this spring's rally continues, minor resistance
crossing at .8702 is a potential target later this month. The daily
ADX (a trend-following indicator) has entered a bullish trend mode
signaling that additional gains near-term are possible.

PRECIOUS METALS

August comex gold was higher overnight due to light short covering
following Thursday's breakout below April's uptrend line crossing
near 267.50. This week's closes below the uptrend line have confirmed
a breakout and opening the door for a test of this spring's low
crossing at 257.30 later this year. Stochastics and RSI are bearish
signaling that additional weakness into June is likely.

July silver was slightly higher overnight due to light short covering
as it consolidates some of its losses of the past four trading
sessions. Follow-through short covering during the day session is
possible as short traders bank some of this week's profits ahead of
the weekend. Nevertheless, momentum indicators have turned bearish
signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible. If the
decline off last week's high continues, a test of trading range
support crossing at 4.31 is July's next target later this year.

July copper was lower overnight extending this week's decline.
However, Thursday's mid-range close leaves the door open for two-
sided trading on Friday as a short covering bounce ahead of the
weekend is possible. If this week's decline continues, a test of
May's low crossing at 74.75 is possible later this month. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices into
early-June appears likely.

GRAINS

July corn was fractionally higher overnight as traders await this
morning's export sales report, which was delayed due to the Memorial
Day holiday on Monday. Pre-report estimates range from 800,000 to
1,000,000 metric tonnes. Thursday's rally was triggered by
end-of-the-month short covering and rising concerns over cool/wet
conditions across the western Corn Belt, which has slowed early crop
development and has forced some producers to replant portions of the
crop that have been drowned out. Thursday's high tested May's
downtrend line crossing at 1.93 1/4. Multiple closes above this
resistance level would signal that a short-term low has likely been
posted. Also a higher close on Friday would increase the odds that
the recent breakout below weekly support crossing at 1.91 1/2 might
have marked a bear trap. Early calls are for July corn to open steady
to 3/4 of a cent higher this morning.

July wheat was higher in overnight trading due to rising concerns
over potential disease problems with the hard red winter wheat crop
in Kansas. This week's closes above broken support crossing at 2.65
have tempered the near-term bearish outlook in the market while
opening the door for a possible test of May's downtrend line crossing
near 2.72 later this month. This morning's export sales report is not
expected to show a significant increase in export demand, which has
been less than stellar all year. Pre-report sales estimates range
from 350,000 to 450,000 metric tonnes. Early calls are for July wheat
to open 1 to 2 cents higher this morning.

SOYBEAN COMPEX

July soybeans were higher in overnight trading due to spillover short
covering from Thursday's strong rally. Rising concerns over cool/wet
weather across the heart of the U.S. Soybean Belt, which is causing
emergence problems along with delayed planting triggered Thursday's
rally. Additional support comes from demand, which remains strong and
should force the USDA to raise this years export projection in the
June supply/demand report. Multiple closes above recent highs
crossing at 4.53 1/2 would confirm an upside breakout of this
spring's trading range while opening the door for a possible test of
March's high crossing at 4.77 3/4 later this month. Pre-report
estimates for this morning's export sales report range from 200,000
to 300,000 metric tonnes. Early calls are for July soybeans to open
steady to 2 to 3 cents higher this morning.

July soybean meal was higher overnight due to follow-through short
covering from Thursday's strong rebound. Thursday's close above
broken trendline support has tempered the near-term bearish outlook
in the market. Closes above last Friday's high crossing at 168 would
renew this spring's rally making the 62% retracement level of this
winter's decline crossing at 169.40 July's next target. Pre-report
sales estimates range from 100,000 to 150,000 metric tonnes. Early
calls are for July soybean meal to open 20 to 40-cents higher this
morning.

LIVESTOCK

August hogs closed higher for the third day in a row on Thursday and
above the 62% retracement level of this spring's decline crossing at
63.40. While a setback is possible on Friday due to light profit
taking ahead of the weekend, this week's rally has opened the door
for a possible test of April's gap crossing at 64.90 later this year.
Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices into early-June are possible.

August cattle gapped up and closed above the 75% retracement level of
this year's decline crossing at 73.83 on Thursday. Today's rally
renewed May's advance and set the stage for a test of January's high
crossing at 75.00 later this spring. Expectations for steady to $1.00
higher cash trades this week triggered today's rally. Momentum
indicators are bullish but have become overbought warning traders to
use caution as a top may be near.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee plunged below April's low crossing at 58.80
on Thursday thereby renewing this year's downtrend. Today's move to
new lows opened the door for a test of long-term support crossing at
51.70 later this year. Moderating temps across Brazil's coffee
growing region along with abundant supplies by North American
roasters and huge exchange stocks continue to weigh on coffee prices.

July cocoa closed lower on Thursday and below trading range support
crossing at 955. Session lows fell just short of testing the 62%
retracement level of this winter's rally crossing at 929. I would not
be surprised to see a short covering bounce on Friday that could lead
to a test of broken support at 955. However, momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling that additional weakness into early-June is
possible. If the decline continues, the 75% retracement level at 862
is July's next target.

July sugar posted an inside day with a lower close as it tried to
consolidate some of this week's losses. However, the door to lower
prices remains open following Tuesday's trendline breakout. While
another day or two of consolidation is possible, the door is open for
additional weakness into early-June with 832 then 808 being possible
targets.

July cotton closed slightly higher on Thursday as it continues to
consolidate above psychological support crossing at 40-cents. Talk of
lost cotton production in west Texas provided minor support. However,
beneficial rain farther south in west Texas tempered gains. The Delta
and Southeast are expected to see more rain next week with most of
the U.S. cotton crop in good shape. Pre-report export sales estimates
range from 100,000 to 150,000 bales.

1.1-qualified components in the industry. Broadcom's qualified components i=
nclude a full suite of radio and baseband chips, as well as Link Manager Pr=
otocol (LMP) firmware, providing end-to-end enabling technology for a range=
 of Bluetooth applications. This means that devices developed using Broadco=
m's Blutonium(TM) chips and firmware can attain Bluetooth qualification wit=
h minimal effort, accelerating the time-to-market for these products.   ""Ou=
r Blutonium line provides our customers with unmatched flexibility in the d=
evelopment of their pre-qualified Bluetooth products,"" said Scott Bibaud, D=
irector of Bluetooth Marketing for Broadcom. ""With multiple Bluetooth-quali=
fied basebands and radios, as well as a qualified LMP, Broadcom can provide=
 equipment developers with the solution that's right for their application.=
""   The Blutonium line consists of two standalone all-CMOS Bluetooth radios=
, the Broadcom(R) BCM2001 for general applications and the BCM2002X, a radi=
o-only chip optimized for use in mobile phones. In addition, the family inc=
ludes two baseband processor chips, the BCM2039 standalone baseband and the=

nstead leverages the processor of its host device. Broadcom's LMP firmware =
stack provides the processor logic that manages connections between Bluetoo=
th devices.   ""One of the benefits of Bluetooth is the ability to allow man=
y different types of data devices to share information over the air,"" Bibau=
d said. ""As a result, no `one-size-fits-all' solution can truly accommodate=
 the breadth of applications created by this technology. We've developed th=
e Blutonium line to include a variety of Bluetooth-qualified silicon and sy=
stem solutions to enable whatever applications our customers dream up, prov=
iding functionality optimized for their product needs and getting those pro=

  With high receiver sensitivity and excellent blocking performance, the Bl=
utonium product line is ideally suited to perform well in harsh radio frequ=
ency (RF) environments such as inside mobile phones and laptop computers or=
 in geographical areas with high concentrations of radio interference. Blut=
onium supports the complete Bluetooth 1.1 feature set, including full data =
rate, seven slave piconet with master/slave switching, and scatternet. Manu=
factured in a standard digital CMOS process, the Blutonium line features hi=
gh levels of integration, incorporating all RF circuits on-chip and requiri=
ng very few external passive components, which reduces system cost and boar=
d space requirements.   Qualifications of the BCM2001 and BCM2002 were perf=
ormed by Hyper Corporation, a Bluetooth Qualification Body (BQB) in Pleasan=
ton, California, while qualifications of the BCM2019 and BCM2039 were perfo=
rmed by 7 Layers, a BQB located in Irvine, California. The qualification pr=
ocess consisted of testing of the baseband chips and LMP firmware, as well =
as some radio testing by the BQBs, and verification of test data against sp=
ecifications set by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). In accordan=
ce with these procedures, Hyper and 7 Layers performed testing and reviewed=

Sponsored by TechnoScout, where technology hits home.

Here at TechnoScout, we work hard to bring you products now, that you will not see in stores for months. It is our promise to you to keep you up-to-date of the neatest, coolest, latest high-tech gear every month. Take a look at some of the products below that made our list of some of the best products to cross our rigorous testing and analyzing this month.


Photos, music, important documents?
Now that everything is on your computer, copy it
The EPO CD Backup Duplicator makes flawless copies of any format CD, including audio, data or video.

To make backup copies of CDs, you typically need a CD reader (CD-ROM) for the source disk you are copying, a CD burner (CD-R or CD-RW) to write the copy CD, and a computer with appropriate software to format the files. The EPO CD Backup Duplicator does it all-easily and automatically-without the need of a computer. Most duplicating procedures may not be able to copy certain protected files. But CD Backup uses a technology called ""image copy"" to duplicate the exact same data found on the original disk. The EPO CD Backup can flawlessly duplicate any format of compact disk, even protected ones (see warning below). The CD Backup is the right choice for excellent accuracy.
You can use CD Backup to copy important data and application files for safe storage. And you can use the duplicator to create your own personal audio disks from tracks taken from your own personal CD collection.*
To find out more about this must-have product, click here:

Disclaimer:  EPO CD Back-up should be used only for backing up personal data and compiling personal audio tracks.  Any copyright of material in a source disk belongs to the author and/or company which issued the disk.  Unauthorized duplication of copyrighted material is strictly prohibited.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user 
id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

3075,"California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. 
The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. 
FERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. 
If the project ""is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action,"" the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). 
The pipeline could be delivering gas to the first of two new power plants in Mexicali as early as mid-summer.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

3128,"Please be advised that we successfully converted existing data and implemented the new contract/capacity release system for Transwestern last week.  With that, there is one change that will impact the Commercial group.  In the old CBS system, the Contract Admin group was responsible for identifying whether a contract was negotiated as a one-part or two-part rate.  Until a deal sheet is built and the new rates/revenue system is implemented, the Marketers will continue to update discounts in the existing CBS system under Negotiated Rates Maintenance.  

Additionally, the Marketer will be responsible for updating within the same rate maintenance screen the one-part/two-part flag for all new firm contracts under the 'reservation' charge code.  If a contract amendment requires a change to this indicator, this must also be captured; however, be advised that this field does not have effective dates.  Therefore, if the indicator is not applicable until a future date, the one-part/two-part flag cannot be updated because the current billing will pick up this change.  I will provide any additional training if necessary regarding the loading of rates/indicators.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

As a reminder, we have scheduled internal demos of the new system today at 1:30pm and 3pm as well as this Thursday at 1:30pm in EB3907.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Ader and I met with NJ Natural Gas earlier this week to discuss fuel cell 
opportunities in NJ.  As a gas supplier in NJ, these guys are very interested 
in developing some fuel cell projects as a means to increase throughput on 
their system.  They also have a strong relationship with the state commission 
(called the Board of Public Utilities, I think) and there are green funds 
available to subsidize costs, etc.  Sound familiar?

I need to get a CA to these guys and I am forwarding to you the one we signed 
with CRRA.  I like this one because there is an exclusivity clause in it.

In addition to my comments regarding the definitions, here are some other 
thoughts:

haven't checked on availability.  

2. Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days.  2 
(a)  Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine 
Contract.  Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology.

3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement. 

5 (d)  change 1st ""shall"" to ""'may"".

7 (b) does this make sense?  Should we also have the right to specific 
performance?

9.  (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing 
of the letter agreement.  Should say by closing such will have been 
obtained.  I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep 
unless you are comfortable.  I want the HSR risk to be with them, so I don't 
want to contradict it with the rep.

It is highly likely that AES would exercise their early purchase option in 
May. As such, I want to make sure we are thinking about the duties, 
obligations, and indemnities among the parties under the circumstance that 
AES owns the member interests in Haywood, and ENA is continuing its efforts 
to achieve the milestone of the interconnection agreement through August 1. I 
also want to make sure we have adequate indemnities from AES regarding 
actions we will undertake to achieve the interconnection milestone. At the 
end of the day, ENA will be focused on two things: (i) causing TVA to lower 
its Network Upgrade estimate from the current level of $4.8 million, and (ii) 
causing TVA to produce an interconnection agreement in substantially the same 
form as the Gleason interconnect agreement. Obviously, with AES owning the 
Haywood member interests and being in the driver's seat, they will play a key 
role in whether these two items are achieved. I want to make sure that the 
same standards which applied to us prior to them exercising their early 
option (i.e. we were on the hook to use reasonable commercial efforts to 
achieve the milestones) now applies to them during the period that we are 
still trying to achieve the milestones.

Bone marrow transplant
Description:
Bone marrow is a soft fatty tissue found
inside bones. It produces blood cells (red blood cells, platelets
</conditions/ency/article/003647.htm> , and white blood cells). When the
patient develops disease of the blood cells (anemias
</conditions/ency/article/000560.htm> , leukemias, or lymphomas) or when
cancer  </conditions/ency/article/001289.htm> treatment (chemotherapy
</conditions/ency/article/002324.htm> and radiation therapy
</conditions/ency/article/001918.htm> ) damages or destroys the bone marrow,
a transplant with healthy bone marrow can save the patient's life. Patients
need bone marrow transplants because they have dangerously low white blood
cells (which are needed to fight infection) as a result of cancer treatments
or have cancer of the blood cells.

Bone marrow transplant patients are usually
treated in specialized centers and the patient stays in a special nursing
unit (bone marrow transplant unit: BMT) to limit exposure to infections.

Donated bone marrow must match the patient's
tissue type. It can be taken from the patient, a living relative (usually a
brother or a sister: allogeneic), or from an unrelated donor (found through
the national marrow donor program which lists more than 700,000 potential
donors). Donors are matched through special blood tests called HLA tissue
typing (see HLA antigens  </conditions/ency/article/003550.htm> ).

Bone marrow is taken from the donor in the
operating room while the patient is deep asleep and pain-free (under general
anesthesia). Some of patient's bone marrow is removed from the top of the
hip bone (iliac crest). The bone marrow is filtered, treated, and
transplanted immediately or frozen and stored for later use. Bone marrow
transplant is transfused into the patient through a vein (IV line) and is
naturally transported back into the bone cavities where it grows quickly to
replace the old bone marrow.

What to Expect After:
Bone marrow transplant prolongs the life of
a patient who would otherwise die.  Relatively normal activities can be
resumed as soon as the patient feels well enough and after consulting with
the doctor.

The other significant problems with a bone
marrow transplant are those of all major organ transplants--finding a donor
and the cost of the surgery. The donor is usually a sibling with compatible
tissue. The more siblings the patient has the more chances to find the right
donor.

Convalescence:
The hospitalization period is from 4 to 6
weeks, during which time the patient is isolated and under strict monitoring
because of the increased risk of infection. The patient will require
attentive follow-up care for 2 to 3 months after discharge from the
hospital. It may take 6 months to a year for the immune system to fully
recover from this procedure.

Risks:
The major problem with bone marrow
transplants (allogeneic type) is graft-versus-host disease
</conditions/ency/article/001309.htm> ; the opposite of the graft rejection
</conditions/ency/article/000815.htm> problems seen in other transplants (
transplant rejection  </conditions/ency/article/000815.htm> ). The
transplanted healthy bone marrow cells tend to attack the patient's (host)
cells as though they were foreign organisms. In this case, drugs to suppress
the immune system ( immunosuppression  </conditions/ency/article/000818.htm>
medications) must be taken indefinitely, weakening the body's ability to
fight infections.

3188,"Yes we do want to renew the option through September of next year and we will 
need to persuade them to lower the option premium.  Her is a thought:  the 
land fill closure cost is approximately $2.9 million.  Could we create a new 
option agreement that states that the strike price is $4.2 million ($1.3 the 
original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost) so we could 
pay an option premium of up to $210,000 (5% of $4.2 million).  At closing, we 
reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the 
land fill.  Since Certosa Holdings will not start the closure until they are 
assured that we will exercise the option if even then, the net cost to us 
would drop back to  the original strike price.  Could we get this past the

Kay,

Thanks again for helping me out.  I wanted to pass on a few things that were 
discussed immediately prior to the execution of the LOI just so that nothing 
is lost in the changing of the guards.

1)  John Keffer asked ENA to determine whether the equity interest held by 
ENA in the SPV must be a voting interest.  The concern here was that the LLC 
Agreement was structured to have the 20% owner hold a non-voting member 
interest and John wanted to be certain that this satisfied the terms of the 
GE LM6000 contract;

2)  The LOI talks about the ""minimal representations"" that ENA will be 
required to give to Coral in connection with the disposition of the 80% 
member interest to the Acquisition Entity.  I spoke with Jim Shepherd 
(internal counsel to Coral - who by the way was a colleague/friend of mine 
when I was employed at Coral) and assured him that ENA would be willing to 
provide the necessary reps to give Coral comfort that we hadn't done anything 
with the SPV (i.e. incur liabilities or convey other interests in the SPV);

3)  Jim Shepherd and I also spoke about expressly incorporating the 
confidentiality provisions of the LOI into the final deal documentation.  I 
wanted to be certain that Coral could not discuss deal terms with anyone else 
(for fear that the deal structure becomes known in the market place);

4)  On the matter of taxes, Don Whaley (of Coral) expressly agreed with Ben 
Jacoby that all ad valorem taxes and other taxes associated with ownership 
(and the sale/transfer) of the units would be borne by Coral.  This comment 
about the ad valorem taxes (which aren't expressly stated in the LOI) is 
particularly important because (as you know) we anticipate a $250,000 tax on 
each turbine that is delivered prior to year end.  I believe that Ben wants 
to execute a letter agreement with GE (similar to the one that was executed 
for the first 14 units) pursuant to which we accept title/delivery in 
consideration of a $300,000 waiver of cancellation fees.  I have reservations 
about this because ENA will effectively be making an additional 300k per unit 
by stuffing a $250,000 obligation to Coral.  Doesn't really pass the smell 
test in my book.

5)  One final item, this deal has not been DASHed and a legal risk memo has 
not been prepared.  I would think that the biggest legal risk in this 
transaction is the risk of discovery of the true deal structure by GE.  I 
prepared a legal risk memo that highlighted this risk when I did the original 
deal with Air Liquide and am happy to share that with you if you so desire.

Again, many thanks.

Gore good for health-care, fuel cells

NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - As Election Day nears, a key question confronting 
investors is how each presidential candidate will affect the stock market.
At no other time in U.S. history is such a question so pertinent, with about 
half of all households owning equities.
In this article, CBS.MarketWatch.com identifies sectors that will get a boost 
under an Al Gore presidency. On Wednesday, we'll examine the impact if George 
W. Bush wins. See our full election coverage.

CBS MarketWatch Columns
Updated:
10/31/2000 9:37:46 AM?ET




First, a caveat: Despite the campaign rhetoric, analysts said, a president 
has less direct impact on the stock market than do the economic cycle, the 
stock market cycle, the oil cartel, the global economy, the strength of the 
U.S. dollar, interest rates and many other influences.
As such, giving any administration sole or main credit for a bull or bear 
market would be misleading.
Where the government has greater influence is in such things as military 
spending and, more critically, the choice of Fed chairman, said Arnold 
Kaufman, editor of the S&P Outlook, an investment publication published by 
Standard & Poor's. 
Investors also should remember that campaign promises don't always work out. 
That said, analysts have identified sectors that either could benefit under 
Gore, or that historically have done well under Democrats. 
Capital goods
If Democrats live up to their ""big spender"" image, Kaufman said, expect a 
rise in infrastructure spending. That means an impact on the communications 
and transportation, among other sectors.
His favorite stocks here include Sanmina Corp. (SANM: news, msgs), a maker of 
electronic components for equipment makers, and Tyco (TYC: news, msgs), a 
diversified electronics and industrial company.
Sanmina makes electronic components and cables for equipment manufacturers in 
the communications, industrial, medical and high-speed computer markets.
Last week, Merrill Lynch chose Sanmina as one of top 10 tech stocks that are 
expected to outperform in the next six to 12 months.
In the fourth quarter, Sanmina's earnings before one-time charges more than 
doubled from the like period in 1999, beating Wall Street's consensus 
estimate by 10 cents. Revenue almost doubled to $1.27 billion. Company 
profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings.
Tyco sells to the telecommunications, electronics, health-care, industrial 
goods and fire and security services markets. Tyco recently completed the 
acquisition of Mallinckrodt, a specialty medical products maker, boosting its 
position in the respiratory care arena.
Fourth-quarter earnings before extraordinary items rose by 40 percent to $1.1 
billion, or 64 cents a share, from a year ago. Sales went up by 25 percent to 
$7.8 billion. Company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. 
Earlier this month, Legg Mason raised its rating on Tyco to ""buy"" from 
""market performance."" Elizabeth Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear 
Stearns, includes Tyco on her recommended list.
Mortgage lenders 
A Gore presidency could end an action by some lawmakers to sever these 
lenders' lines of credit from the U.S. Treasury, said Erik Gustafson, senior 
portfolio manager for Liberty Growth Stock fund.
The argument for severance is that these congressionally chartered lenders 
have an unfair advantage over other banking and mortgage lenders. In 
addition, the SEC's new fair disclosure regulation can be expected to boost 
companies with reliable earnings growth, according to Bear Stearns. Stocks 
expected to do well in this environment include Fannie Mae (FNM: news, msgs) 
and Freddie Mac (FRE: news, msgs), Bear Stearns said.
Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie Mac, 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., buy conventional home mortgages from 
banks and mortgage bankers and sells them as securities. Fannie Mae: Company 
profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. Freddie Mac: Company 
profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. 
Health care providers
An increase in government spending on Medicare should boost stocks in this 
sector. Warren Isabelle, president of Ironwood Capital Management, likes 
nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises (BEV: news, msgs).
Last week, ING Barings raised its rating on Beverly Enterprises to ""buy"" from 
""hold."" Beverly Enterprises recently reported a second-quarter profit, 
reversing a loss from 1999. The company's business is improving because of 
increased revenue from Medicare and Medicaid. However, Beverly has taken a 
hit lately because it's adding $50 million to its reserves for patient 
liability costs for 2000.
Alternative energy sources
In his book, ""Earth in the Balance,"" Gore called for the gradual elimination 
of the internal combustion engine and espoused other environmental beliefs. 
As such, alternative energy stocks should do well under his presidency, 
specifically fuel cell companies, said Jim Lowell, chief portfolio strategist 
for Adviser Investments Management.
One stock he likes is FuelCell Energy (FCEL: news, msgs). FuelCell develops 
electrochemical technologies that generate electricity without combustion. 
Last week, Friedman Billings Ramsey raised its rating on Fuelcell to 
""accumulate,"" following Chase H&Q's upgrade to ""buy"" earlier in the month. 
FuelCell also has allied with Enron (ENE: news, msgs) to develop and sell 
FuelCell's Direct FuelCel products. Enron has invested $5 million in the 
company. Company profile, latest financials, analysts' ratings. 
What about tech stocks?
Here, analysts have mixed feelings. Kaufman believes both candidates would be 
good for the sector in general, but Gustafson disagrees, citing the worsening 
of the regulatory environment in the last eight years and the antitrust 
action against Microsoft (MSFT: news, msgs). Lowell thinks Gore's impact 
would be neutral to negative, but analyst Safa Rashtchy of US Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray said the Democrat could be good for Net stocks.
Gore vs. Bush portfolios
Thus far, Gore is ahead of Bush, based on a basket of stocks pegged to each 
candidate's possible presidency. Since Sept. 1, Lisa Kammert, an analyst at 
Birinyi Associates, has been tracking two portfolios comprising 12 stocks 
each that would do well under Gore or Bush. As of Monday, Gore's portfolio 
has outperformed Bush's by 4.43 percent, based on a simple average of each 
stock's return. In 1992, the same model accurately predicted a Clinton win.
In the Gore portfolio are Amazon.com, Yahoo, Citigroup, Bank of America, 
Disney, Time Warner, BellSouth, Duke Energy, Tenet Healthcare, Procter & 
Gamble, Coca-Cola and Waste Management. In Bush's basket are IBM, Microsoft, 
Exxon Mobil, Transocean Sedco, Merrill Lynch, Bristol Myers, W.R. Grace, 
Beazer Homes, Philip Morris and Boeing. Going into the last week before the 
election, Gore has outpaced Bush most of the time since Sept. 1.
As for job growth, a study by executive recruiter Challenger, Gray & 
Christmas indicates that a Gore administration would boost employment for the 
mass transit sector, education, health care, construction (homes and 
schools), agriculture, lawyers, insurance, law enforcement, commercial 
banking and forestry.?

3199,"FPL, Entergy Merge in $7 Billion Deal 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - FPL Group Inc., the parent of Florida Power & Light Co., 
said on Monday it would merge with Entergy Corp. in a stock deal worth $7 
billion to create the largest U.S. power generating company. 
The combined company would have a total enterprise value of more than $27 
billion, consisting of $16.4 billion in equity market capitalization and 
$10.7 billion in debt and preferred stock, the companies said. 
The merger is expected to immediately boost earnings for both companies. 
Under the terms of the agreement, FPL shareholders would receive one share of 
a new holding company for each FPL share held. Entergy shareholders would get 
0.585 of a share of the new holding company for each Entergy share. 
Based on the companies' closing stock prices, the deal would value Entergy at 
its market value of $7 billion, or about $30.89 per share. FPL shares closed 
Friday at 52-13/16, off a year high of 56-5/8 but up from a low of 36-3/8. 
Entergy stock ended at 30-5/16, off a high of 31-3/16 but up from a low of 
15-15/16. 
SHAREHOLDERS' APPROVAL REQUIRED 
The combination must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal 
regulators. FPL and Entergy said they hope to complete the transaction within 
15 months. 
``The merger combines two strategically aligned, financially healthy 
companies into an organization that has no equal in the industry,'' said J. 
Wayne Leonard, Entergy chief executive. 
Leonard will serve as president and chief executive of the combined company 
while FPL's chief executive, James Broadhead, will serve as chairman. 
The deal was billed as a merger of equals but gives FPL shareholders 57 
percent of the combined company and eight of 15 seats on the board of 
directors, the companies said. 
Once combined, the new company is expected to see annual cost savings of $110 
million to $150 million in its regulated businesses derived from eliminating 
duplicate corporate and administrative positions and programs.

Could we schedule some time for a conference call next week?  I would 
appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the legal issues.  I have 
the lofty goal of not working Memorial Day weekend this year, so I'm trying 
to get as much done on this deal as soon as possible.

3210,"  I took several assignments from the last World Hunger call.  Status as 
follows:

a.   Tax language-  I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking 
him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep.  Steve Swifit 
and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call.

b.   Insurance Language review.   I sent same version to David Marshall and 
Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA's are new 
technology.

c.   I ""volunteered"" to look at the termination language in world hunger, GE 
had some problems, and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract.   I 
drafted a fix last Friday, sent to Kay M for comment.  I have included my 
suggested changes in the attached redline.  I have forwarded same fix to GE 
at end Friday for Arcos.    I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with 
the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination.  I think it works.

d.  I ""volunteered"" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 in 
relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages.  I have done that in the 
attached redline of the T&C and Exhibits.

e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the 
reduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8.   I had sent out a couple weeks 
ago but received no reaction.    I have entered that fix in the attached 
redline.

f.  I have made several minor changes to definitions associated with 
performance.

Attached is Rev4-JR version of GE T&C's and Exhibits for world hunger.  They 
start from the clean rev 4 version of the T&Cs that Peter forwarded to me at 
my request.  The attached are redlined to show my changes.

I have not sent any of this to GE except for the termination language fix.   
I suggest that the Enron team give these a quick read before the World hunger 
call.  I can print same here and share with GE during the call unless there 
is an objection.  

I hope this will help to advance the process.  My earlier emails to Paul and 
Matt were not intended confuse the situation with different drafts.  Please 
ignore those and for the above purposes use the attached files.


Kay- I suggest that you forward to others who you feel appropriate for the 
purposes of the world hunger call on Wednesday.

Kay",Kay,,the Capacity and Energy Contract CompareRite
3226,"Since the time frame is short, I wanted to give you an outline to mark 
up/correct.

Here's how I understand the deal:

People's has the Manlove gas storage facility.  We have presented to People's 
a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with Bammel.  
Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and 
the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization.  The 
essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to 
$25mm, as our fee.  In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial, 
legal, accounting and engineering lead. Peoples and Enron will work together 
on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation.

We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week.  The basic goals are:

Define scope of the agreement
Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas
Create exclusivity for Enron 
Define financial arrangements (cost/profit)
Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and 
covered by our confidentiality agreement.
Define term (5 years) 

Each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split 
50/50, with prior approval.  In that regard an immediate concern is getting 
the engineering work kicked off.  

We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals.  We do not 
want it specific to this field, since we want the benefit of the use of our 
methodology.

Please correct/supplement, etc.

A new argument appears, however, on the first five pages of the motion

I received a current statement of the open matters we have with GT.  In rough numbers it is around $270,000 for all the Florida work, excluding Ft. P.  Most files only have one month worth of billing, so it gives us a bit of a feel for the order of magnitude of the burn rate.  What I don't know is if the burn rate is increasing or decreasing.  With the litigation, the moratorium and the DEP proceedings, an escalation wouldn't surprise me.

Unfortunately, we don't have an estimate yet on the whole package, including the moratorium ($80,000 bill for June) and  the land use/environmental work ($44k in June for Deerfield, $71k for Pompano).

proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

I saw an article mentioning that EPA published a draft guidance (66 Fed. Reg. 52,403) clarifying the definition of ""stationary source"" to allow heat/power co-generation facilities to be treated as separate sources from the underlying host facility (e.g., a manufacturing plant) for NSR purposes.
 
Although the focus of the draft guidance is on cogeneration facilities, I suppose that there might be some general language in there that could clarify the single-source analysis as it pertains to the ancillary equipment at our plants for which no separate BACT analysis was done.  Are either of you familiar with the new draft guidance (or with anything else that we could use to bolster our position on this issue)?
 
Many thanks,

Accordingly, we have pulled our punches somewhat, and simply try to accomplish 3 things: (1) place all parties on notice that we will be advocating issuance of the original draft permit at the hearing (we can always pull back on issues that turn out to have no consequence), (2) require DEP to clearly state, for the record, exactly what textual changes to the draft permit it is advocating (we will also attempt to do this through discovery), and (3) sensitive the judge to the fact that we will likely need to expedite our discovery from DEP.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.",Chewco http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/,$1.2 billion approximately $96 million approximately $113 million approximately $250 million approximately $132 million approximately $17 million approximately $5 million $17 million approximately $711 million $561 million $685 million $628 million,the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC the Special Committee the Enron Board of Directors Enron LJM Board Special Committee Joint Energy Development Investments JEDI LJM1 Chewco

3322,"Per Barbara's request, here's a summary of much of what I'm working on:

Co Op City asset management arrangement:  In this deal, Enron would build a 
small power generation facility for a housing co op in the Bronx, Co Op 
City.  We would arrange for O & M services, supply the fuel (primarily gas), 
market their excess power, and, for the first 4 years, take 1/2 the offtake.  
We are currently working to structure the transaction to keep if off the 
balance sheet and maximize the mark.  We are working on  a term sheet, and I 
will be in NYC later this week to continue negotations with the customer.  
Mark Bernstein is the originator, Debbie Chance is the developer, and NEPCO 
Houston is  involved.  I discussed outside counsel with Jeff, and I would 
like to use John Klauberg at LeBeouf.  

Sell of two development projects in Illinois.  Two of the sites we have 
developed (sans equipment) are up for sale, and Fred Mitro has contacted me 
about supporting the transaction.  Lisa Mellencamp had previously contacted 
Bracewell about working on it, but I'm a little concerned about the amount of 
experience of the person they have designated.  I've asked Clark Thompson for 
some information on his background.  

SW 501d - our claim against SWestinghouse, and possible sale of the 
equipment.  We have issues with the vendor concerning the late delivery of 
this equipment.  We are also trying to sell the equipment (a 
turbine/generator set) to Calpine.  

Fuel Cells - last year Enron made a $5million investment in Fuel Cells, a 
company which is developing an almost green form of power generation.  We 
received contingent warrants which we can cash in if we arrange for 55 mw.  
We are working with an instrumentality of the state of Connecticut about them 
buying 26 megawatts. We are working on the purchase agreement with FC, and 
the project development agreement with the State.  It is quiet right now, as 
funding is figured out.

There's TurboPark maintenance stuff which pops up weekly.

GE - Sheila and I have a weekly phone conference with GE to work on a 
standard contract for buying turbines.  I've heard a rumor that we will be 
buying some more, although neither Sheila nor I have been contacted yet.  

I think this is a fair summary of the big ticket items.

should be Section 14.  This same reference to 17 is also made in other areas

under Section 15, some of the Event of Default Sections numbers do not exist 
(ie. 11 and 12).  Please look into these sections in their entirety.  With 
respect to this section, I would like to change the cure period from 30 days 
to 3 days and of course in instances of bankruptcy, misrepresenation in the 
Reps & Warr, etc., there should not a cure period.  

With respect to credit.  In reading the contract it seems that the 
counterparty is going to be a consortium of entities (MDEA, Yazoo & 
Clarksdale).  Are each of the counterparties jointly and severally liable?  
Answers to the this relationship structure will be necessary prior to 
proposing credit terms for both the Master Gas and Master Power agmts.  If 
this is the structure, we should probably look into getting legal opinions 
regarding the cities' authority to enter into such obligations.  In addition, 
do the city's have authority to enter into agreements for greater than 1 yr.  
In my experience with other munis, they generally are, but only at the 
Enterprise Fund level (Public Utility).  Perhaps we should confirm this.  To 
the extent that MDEA (stand alone) is not 100% supported by the cities, we 
will need financial statements on MDEA.

I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona.  I remember

clutter.  I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign.  Does

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

Sorry I missed you when you returned by call this am.

I have some concerns about the voice mail you left re: assignment language.  
Enron can't stay on the hook for payment if the agreement is assigned, as 
this would bust the financing/accounting arrangement.  What we have tried to 
do to meet your concerns is to see that ABB has a contract with a party which 
is as financially sound as Enron by adding the guaranty language.  This 
addresses ABB's request that the party with the payment obligation have the 
""financial wherewithall"" to make the payments. This is a big change from 
where we were in the last contract. 

I've had a request to get an approximate storage cost (monthly) for budgetary

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/24/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders. 
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. 
During the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. 
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while ""we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well."" Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. 
Mr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was ""very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about."" He added ""we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy."" 
Internal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. 
During the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. ""There's the appearance you are hiding something,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. ""You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board."" 
Mr. Lay responded, ""We're trying to be as transparent as we can.""

Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/24/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities. 
In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.
But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. 
The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. 
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. 
After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' 
Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' 
Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. 
Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. 
Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' 
Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. 
Mr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. 
The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. 
After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.

Options Report
Surge in Optimism Prompts Straddles In Enron and Cisco
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Bullish calls traded heavily early as investors, encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares, bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies. 
At one point, the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange fell to 0.28, compared with 0.68 Friday and Monday's three-month closing low of 0.42.
The surge of optimism -- also evident in the CBOE market-volatility index, or VIX -- prompted traders to begin covering the downside, just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat. Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. 
Buyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. 
The implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. 
The volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. 
To be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.

Lay tries to assure Enron investors 
Company's credibility questioned 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chief financial officer ran two investment partnerships that did business with Enron, the company's chief executive officer said Tuesday. 
The Houston-based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's former role with two partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron. 
Enron disclosed Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an ""informal inquiry"" into transactions between Enron and the two partnerships. 
It declined to say if the SEC is looking into other transactions. 
After the disclosure, Enron's stock fell almost 21 percent Monday. Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. 
The news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. 
Tuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. 
It remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. 
""I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions,"" he said. 
Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. 
He did say Enron was aware an ""inherent conflict of interest"" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. 
In response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. 
""There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron,"" he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. 
Lay and Enron's board continue to have the ""highest faith and confidence"" in Fastow, he added. 
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. 
Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. 
It took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. 
During the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. 
They stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. 
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. 
""I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call,"" he said.

Busy signal 
Enron should know plenty about bandwidth.
Through Enron Broadband Services, the giant energy company boasts about ""developing an open and efficient market for bandwidth that provides liquidity, reliability, price transparency and guaranteed service levels"". 
But there were no guarantees about service levels yesterday, when Enron held a conference call to ""address investor concerns"" about its financial dealings. 
Despite the bandwidth expertise, the call - the first time that Andrew Fastow, chief financial officer, has faced questions about the transactions from analysts - was available to just 300 lucky telephone diallers. A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. 
Those investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on.

USA: Enron mulls ways to cover portfolio shortfalls-WSJ.

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. 
Enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.
The report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, the report said. 
According to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report said. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward repaying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron. 
Glisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" 
According to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. 
Enron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor concerns after U.S. regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than $10 billion in value over the past week. 
Enron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in cash flow, depending on commodity prices and market hedges.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

10/24/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron (ENE) shares, diluting the position of current shareholders.
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months. 
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share.

Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750-million loan, ensuring access to credit if the beleaguered company is cut off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter. 
Enron's shares and bonds plunged after the firm said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its finances.
The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75% this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends on a $3-billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations. 
As a second-tier commercial paper borrower, any ratings drop may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market and raise costs of short-term debt. 
Enron shares dropped 86 cents to close at $19.79 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars over the next 18 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, treasurer Ben Glisan said. The possible shortfall related to about $3.2-billion (U.S.) in notes that related entities sold to investors since 1999, he said. Proceeds from those notes were invested in various Enron assets. Mr. Glisan said those notes come due over the next 18 months and Enron still hopes to sell enough assets to fully repay the notes. However, making up any shortfall with funds raised by selling stock has become more expensive as Enron's share price has plunged. Over the past week, shares of the energy trading giant have fallen more than 40 per cent.

Abreast of the Market
Everest Re, St. Paul and Providian Drop, but Markets Stay Resilient
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

10/24/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements. 
Shares of drug maker Pharmacia fell $4.37, or 13%, to $38.39, after the company issued third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, but also issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed.
In fact, several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. 
Shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. 
Power utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. 
Nevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. 
""Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market,"" Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. ""Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it."" 
Some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. 
Whatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. 
Investors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. 
Consumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. 
There were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. 
Vitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. 
NetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Chartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. 
Shares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. 
EarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. 
AT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Several steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31. 
McKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug distributor and health-care information technology provider posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. 
Watson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its rating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings projections for the company. 
Furniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating on the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers.

NEW DELHI -- Following Enron Corp. U.S. energy company AES Corp. has turned to the Indian prime minister for help in settling its grievances with a state government. 
In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India is being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.
A copy of the letter, dated Oct. 1, was made available to the Associated Press. 
AES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. 
AES and Enron are the only major American power companies to make big investments in India since the government allowed foreign investment in the sector in the early 1990s. 
In his letter, Mr. Bakke drew Mr. Vajpayee's attention to the ""expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation . . . and direct interference with day-to-day management"" by the state government and its agencies.

UK: LNG delays could spawn shipping crisis - analysts.
By Pete Harrison

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The transport chain supporting the global LNG industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines, shipping analysts warn. 
More LNG tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the Far East, many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand, which might emerge later than scheduled.
""The issue is timing,"" Jarle Sjo, shipping equity analyst at Oslo-based investment bank First Securities told Reuters. 
""Historically, LNG projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about six months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term,"" he added. 
The world fleet of LNG tankers currently numbers 123, but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004, according to shipping database Fairplay. 
Gas industry analysts expect some LNG projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn, excess capacity at existing plants in Asia and a sharp fall in U.S. natural gas prices this year. 
Svein Erik Amundsen, Managing Director of Norwegian shipping group Bergesen, said that a sustained economic downturn could have ""consequences."" 
""I wouldn't be surprised by project delays,"" he told Reuters. ""This could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment."" 
""I think you can say we're still optimistic, but more cautiously optimistic than before,"" he added. Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. 
STOP AND THINK 
The world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. 
Golar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. 
""There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered,"" Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, ""The only risk is things might be delayed."" 
Stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. 
Golar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. 
""We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender,"" Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. 
He said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. 
""It's a good time to wait,"" said Saverys.

INDIA PRESS:British Gas Seeks ONGC Deal For Field Control

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- British Gas has offered India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) equity in its exploration acreage in Brazil and a cash settlement in lieu of operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields, the Economic Times reported Wednesday. 
ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) are claiming operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields following Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd.'s 30% stake sale to BG, according to the report.
State-owned ONGC holds a 40% stake in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields and Reliance owns 30%. 
The Enron Oil & Gas stake sale will fall through if BG isn't given the operatorship of the oil fields, Nigel Shaw, vice president of BG India said in the report. 
Shaw said the equity partners are in discussions on the issue of operatorship, the report said. 
British Gas is a unit of BG Group PLC (BRG). Enron Oil & Gas is a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE).

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron third-quarter earnings rise.

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday its third-quarter earnings rose as its core wholesale marketing and trading division delivered strong returns. 
The company said earnings rose to $393 million, or 43 cents per share, from $292 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. The company reported a share loss of 84 cents after $1.01 billion of nonrecurring charges.
""After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energybusinesses,"" said Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman and chif executive officer. 
Enron's non-recurring charges included $287 million related to the write-down of its troubled water venture, Azurix, as well as $544 million writedown related to various investments including its retail electricity provider New Power Co. and $180 million related to restructuring of its broadband operations. 
Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected earnings of 42 cents to 45 cents per share, with a mean estimate of 43 cents. 
The results met expectations for a rocky quarter that included the surprise departure of President and Chief Executive Jeff Skilling in August, after just six months at the helm. 
Enron shares closed on Monday at $33.17, down $2.64 or 7.3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year, the stock has fallen some 60 percent, far worse than the 25 percent loss of the Standard & Poor's utilities index .

Enron Has Loss of 84 Cents a Share in Third Quarter (Update2)

     (Adds profit excluding charges in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, said it had a third-quarter loss after taking
$1.01 billion in charges for restructuring, investment losses, and
the planned sale of a water business.

     The loss was $618 million, or 84 cents a share after
preferred-dividend payments, Houston-based Enron said in a
statement. A year earlier, Enron had net income of $292 million,
or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion from
$30 billion.

     The charges totaled $1.11 a share. They included $287 million
for asset impairments by water company Azurix Corp., $180 million
to restructure the company's unit that trades fiber-optic
bandwidth and $544 million for losses on investments including New
Power Co., a retail energy-sales venture.

     Excluding the charges, Enron said it would have earned
$393 million, or 43 cents a share. That matched the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.

     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.

     (Enron will hold a conference call to discuss third-quarter
earnings at 10 a.m. New York time. Log on at http://www.enron.com

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp is expected to report later today third-quarter earnings per share of 43 cents, compared with 34 cents a year earlier, according to the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of 17 brokers. 
The integrated energy company is expected to meet near-consensus results driven by its wholesale services division, analysts said.
Montgomery Securities analyst Daniel Tulis is calculating third-quarter EPS of 42 cents, 1 cent below consensus. 
Full-year EPS stands at 1.85. 
Enron's third quarter was marked by the unexpected departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling, for personal reasons, with Chairman Ken Lay reassuming the key position. 
Lay is likely to remain in the position until it is filled within 12-18 months, Tulis said. 
The company remains embroiled in arbitration proceedings in India after its 2.9 bln usd Dabhol power plant in India was closed. The plant's sole client, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), failed - and later refused - to pay bills that now total about 45 mln usd.

Reliant Hires Merrill to Find Buyer for Dutch Power Producer

Reliant Hires Merrill to Find Buyer for Dutch Power Producer

     Amsterdam, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Reliant Energy Inc., the
owner of Houston's utility, said it hired Merrill Lynch & Co. to
find a buyer for its Dutch power-generation business, two years
after acquiring the company from the government for $2.3 billion.

     Reliant has already been approached by possible buyers, said
Clyde Moerlie, a spokesman for Reliant Energy Europe. The unit,
which doesn't have any household customers, earned $9 million in
the second quarter compared with $26 million a year earlier.

     The U.S. company may struggle to get the price it paid for
the Utrecht-based unit, formerly known as UNA, analysts said, on
expectations heightened competition will erode profit further and
as utilities increasingly seek customers as well as power plants.

     In the Dutch generation market, ``there aren't many
opportunities, but prices will fall to much lower levels as
growing competition pushes down tariffs,'' said Steven de Proost,
an analyst at Delta Lloyd Securities in Antwerp.

     Houston-based Reliant paid 2.9 times sales for UNA in 1999,
while Electrabel SA, Belgium's dominant power provider, paid 2.7
times sales for Epon, the biggest utility in the Netherlands. E.ON
AG of Germany paid 1.6 times sales the same year for the generator
NV Electriciteitsbedrijf Zuid-Holland, or EZH.

     Reliant joins rivals TXU Corp. and Edison International in
reassessing its European business amid disappointing earnings.
Reliant in July tied the second-quarter profit drop in Europe to
increased competition and falling margins in the Dutch market.

                            Enron Cuts

     Enron Corp. said last week it will cut 10 percent of its
European workforce, while Edison Mission Energy agreed to sell two
U.K. power plants to American Electric Power Co. on Monday.

     The U.S. utility said last month it was considering a sale of
the Dutch business after it was contacted ``by a number of parties
who have expressed an interest'' in its European assets, and as it
reallocates capital to fulfill ``growth objectives.''

     Merrill already advised the Dutch state on the original sale
of UNA to Reliant, the only time a U.S. company has taken control
of a continental European utility. This year, Merrill ranks sixth
in advising on transactions involving a European utilities target,
with $6.9 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions.

     Potential buyers for UNA, which provides about 20 percent of
the Netherlands' electricity, are likely to be companies already
present in the Dutch market, such as Nuon NV, Eneco, or Spain's
Endesa SA, analysts said. UNA may also attract generation
companies including Mirant Corp. and International Power Plc.

     Atlanta-based Mirant and International Power predecessor
National Power Plc both bid for UNA when it was first put up for
sale. Central and Northern Europe are ``areas we're interested
in,'' said Aarti Singhal, an International Power spokeswoman.

     ``We're looking at all options,'' said Fransce Verdeuzeldonk,
a spokeswoman for Nuon, in an interview.

                         Spanish Interest

     Endesa, Spain's largest power producer, agreed to buy Remu
NV, the No. 4 electric utility in the Netherlands, for 1.5 billion
euros last December. The completion of the transaction has been
held up by the Dutch government, which wants at least 51 percent
of utility company shares to remain in the hands of public
authorities until at least 2004.

     An Endesa spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the
company would be interested in UNA. Endesa said in July its
purchase of an Italian generator was enough to meet its goal of
having 8,000 megawatts of capacity in Europe outside Spain.

     Based in Utrecht in central Netherlands, UNA is one of the
four main power generation companies in Holland, operating six
power plants. It had 1998 sales of about $800 million and is one
of the only generation companies in the market up for grabs.

     Germany's E.ON owns EZH, Belgium's Electrabel controls Epon,
while EPZ, another big power producer, is owned by Essent NV.




India: IDBI signals SOS for Rs 3,000-cr equity

10/16/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd

NEW DELHI, Oct. 15. INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India (IDBI), the country's largest development financial institution, appears to be heading for some serious trouble. 
A revised set of figures placed by the institution to the Ministry of Finance has indicated a cash requirement of Rs 7,000 crore over the next three years, much of which it is finding difficult to tie up. Besides, it has also placed a request for a Rs 3,000-crore equity infusion from the Government.
The revised financial projections were placed before the Finance Ministry last week by an IDBI team headed by the Chairman, Mr P.P. Vora. The meeting was attended by the Advisor, Ministry of Finance, Dr Rakesh Mohan, the Additional Secretary, Capital Markets Division, Mr S.K. 
Purakayastha, and the Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Mr G.P. Muniappan. 
At a meeting on October 5, IDBI had placed its capital infusion requirement at Rs 2,500 crore and immediate fund requirement at about Rs 5,500 crore. 
Officials have been particularly concerned over IDBI's admission that it has been struggling to raise resources from the market due to the rating downgrade in August despite its massive requirements. It has also admitted to the Ministry that it may be heading for losses during the current fiscal. According to sources, the institution has admitted that the losses could spill over to the subsequent year unless assistance comes at an appropriate time. 
IDBI has said the capital infusion of Rs 3,000 crore is being sought to write off a portion of the institution's huge portfolio of non-performing assets (NPAs), which at the end of fiscal 2000-01 stood at over Rs 9,000 crore in gross terms. 
The institution has argued that only a massive NPA write-off would enable it to get back its rating, thereby allowing it to tie up the funds requirement from the market. IDBI's rating was downgraded by Crisil from AAA to AA+ recently. 
IDBI, which was directed by the Government to submit a three-year cash flow statement during the October 5 meeting, has said the additional cash requirement for the three years alone stands at Rs 7,000 crore. 
Of the cash requirement, the immediate need includes a Rs 2,200-crore repayment arising out of the institution's decision to exercise the call option on its earlier bonds series. The repayment would be due in March 2002. 
Moreover, the institution also wants to keep itself ready in the event that Enron, the promoters of Dabhol Power Company, invokes its guarantee of about Rs 1,800 crore.

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Tata Power Company, India's largest private utility, on Tuesday reported net profit for the July-September quarter rose 74 percent over a year earlier, far above analysts' expectations. 
The company, which is negotiating to buy Enron Corp's stake in a troubled Indian unit, said net profit rose to 2.42 billion rupees ($50.42 million) from 1.39 billion a year earlier on sales that rose 17.54 percent to 10.99 billion rupees.
The performance was boosted by a profit of 660 million rupees from sale of long term investments in the quarter, against 210 million a year earlier. 
A Reuters poll of 14 brokerages released last week forecast net profit for the quarter would drop to a median 1.27 billion rupees from a year earlier, on an 8.45 percent rise in sales to 10.11 billion rupees. 
Tata Power generates thermal and hydro-electric power, and distributes electricity across the western state of Maharashtra, including its capital Bombay. 
Ahead of the results, its shares closed down 0.62 percent at 96.65 rupees while the Bombay benchmark index ended 0.54 percent higher. (US$1=47.99 Indian rupees).

A judge prodded parties in a lawsuit against Enron Corp. today to work out a plan to halt the destruction of documents. FBI agents, meanwhile, were dispatched to Enron headquarters to investigate new allegations of document shredding. Meanwhile, federal investigators were poised to enter Enron Corp.'s Houston headquarters. 

""This is the shredded evidence that we got out of Enron,"" attorney William Lerach said as he hurried into the downtown Houston courthouse. He asked U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon to ban any shredding by Enron's former auditor, Arthur Andersen. 

Harmon did not issue an immediate ruling, instead asking plaintiffs and Andersen to discuss the problem and get back to her Wednesday. As for Enron, Lerach said he wants to depose company chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay and others about new allegations of shredding at Enron headquarters. 

Enron bankruptcy attorney Melanie Gray countered that any rulings on taking custody of Enron's own documents must come from the New York bankruptcy court handling the company's Chapter 11 filing. 

A state judge's order already prohibits Andersen's Houston office from shredding Enron-related documents. Chicago-based Andersen acknowledged earlier this month its Houston office had destroyed a significant but undetermined amount of audit-related work. 

While attorneys argued in court, FBI agents were preparing to ender Enron's 50-story headquarters building to look into the latest allegations of shredding. 

""We proactively offered our full cooperation in any investigation the Department of Justice might wish to conduct and we believe such an investigation is properly done by federal authorities, not plaintiffs' counsel for benefit of a lawsuit,"" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 

A former Enron Corp. executive said Monday she witnessed the mass shredding of financial documents at the energy company's accounting office, a practice that began around Thanksgiving and continued through at least last week. 

Maureen Castaneda, Enron's former director of foreign exchange, has turned over to a lawyer several boxes containing mounds of shredded documents dated from November and December. The shreds reveal words that refer to Enron's off-the-books business ventures, the partnerships that led to the company's collapse. 

In an ABC-TV interview that aired Monday night, Castaneda said that around Thanksgiving she saw several boxes of papers being pulled from storage areas and then shredded, despite a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation that had begun the month before. 

Castaneda said the shredding continued through her final day on the job last week and that she used paper-filled boxes she found in the hallway to pack her belongings. She could not be reached for comment by the Chronicle after the ABC broadcast. 

Enron spokesman Palmer, however, said that company officials had directed employees when the SEC investigation began to retain all documents, to destroy nothing. 

""We don't know the significance nor the pertinence of the documents that the plaintiffs' lawyers are parading in front of the media,"" Palmer said Monday. 

""But we do know what we have been telling employees sinceOct. 25. We have told them repeatedly that they are to retain all documents or materials related to Enron transactions, statements to the public and investors, handwritten notes -- in short, any method of information recording."" 

The company issued four directives via e-mail about the document retention, Palmer said. An Oct. 25 e-mail warned employees: ""You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions."" 

Lerach is representing New York-based Amalgamated Bank in a lawsuit against Enron executives. He said Monday he would seek the restraining order in federal court today to prevent the destruction of any other evidence. 

Amalgamated Bank, which manages pension funds that hold Enron stock, sued in November, alleging that Enron executives and board members sold $1.1 billion in Enron stock during the past three years while not disclosing that the stock price was overvalued. 

Lerach said that while he knows of several former Enron employees who saw the shredding, Castaneda was the only one who has come forward. 

""From what we have learned, destruction of evidence at Enron was open and notorious and widespread,"" Lerach said. ""They even shredded on Christmas Day."" 

He said he will have the shredded files in court today. 

""We believe the Enron employees were destroying documents at the same time Andersen people did,"" said Lerach, referring to Enron's former auditor. ""The question of whether there was a coordinated effort is something to look into."" 

In Washington, investigators pushed for public testimony from former Arthur Andersen auditor David Duncan, fired last week after the company said he ordered the destruction of Enron documents last fall. 

Duncan since has cooperated with investigators, telling them that Andersen executives had plenty of information to evaluate Enron's controversial use of offshore partnerships. 

The partnerships allowed Enron to hide millions of dollars of debt for years and mislead investors and its employees about Enron's financial health. 

Duncan ""did not sit there and say, `Enron hid all this information from us and therefore we couldn't count right,' "" Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., who heads the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, told The Associated Press. ""It was more of ... `we made mistakes.'"" 

Greenwood, speaking about comments Duncan made to lawmakers last week, said that rather than a mea culpa, Duncan gave ""a wea culpa; he did not point the finger at Enron."" 

Duncan is scheduled to testify before Greenwood's panel Thursday, one day after lawmakers return to Capitol Hill from their winter break. Duncan's lawyers had tried to delay his testimony, saying he needs more time to prepare, but Greenwood rejected the request, threatening to subpoena Duncan if necessary. 

Duncan ""doesn't really need to recall every detail of what he did for Enron,"" Greenwood told the AP. ""We're focused on the destruction of documents."" 

Enron and Arthur Andersen have come under fire in the wake of the Houston company's implosion last year. Once the world's largest energy trading company, Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, costing thousands of employees their jobs and their retirement nest eggs, much of which were tied up in now virtually worthless company stock. 

At least nine congressional investigations are under way, as are probes by the Labor Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, which is looking into possible criminal violations. 

In addition to the congressional investigations, lawmakers also will turn their attention to legislation aimed at preventing a another debacle like Enron. 

On Monday, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she will introduce a bill this week ensuring that auditors remain independent from the companies they audit. 

The bill comes in the wake of revelations that Andersen received $52 million in annual business from Enron, about half of it from its auditing account and half in consulting fees. 

Joseph Berardino, chief executive officer of Andersen, has dismissed concerns that his company overlooked Enron's accounting practices to preserve other business with the company. 

However, appearing on NBC-TV's Meet the Press over the weekend, Berardino said Andersen is considering whether to end its consulting services and focus on its auditing business. 

Also on the congressional agenda in the coming months will be legislation that Boxer sponsored with Sen. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., to protect employee retirement accounts. 

The Boxer-Corzine Pension Protection and Diversification Act, introduced last month, encourages workers to diversify retirement investment plans by limiting to 20 percent the investment an employee can have in any one stock in his 401(k). 

The bill also would allow employees who receive their own company's stock as part of their employer's matching contribution to their retirement savings plan to sell the stock 90 days after it arrives in their accounts. 

In Enron's case, employees were not allowed to sell matching stock until age 50. 

Chronicle reporter Laura Goldberg and the Associated Press contributed to this story. 


Judge Delays Deciding Possession Of Andersen-Enron Info

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A federal judge Tuesday put off for 24 hours a decision on taking possession of Arthur Andersen documents relating to the firm's accounting and auditing work for failed energy giant, Enron Corp. (ENRNQ).
U.S. District Court Judge Melinda Harmon told plaintiff attorneys and attorneys for Andersen to try to agree on a plan for the preservation and protection of the documents, otherwise she will make her own decision. 
Ken Marks, an attorney representing Enron, told the court that the company called the Department of Justice Monday evening after learning of allegations that Enron documents have been shredded. The Justice Department has dispatched agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to secure documents at Enron and to interview Enron employees about possible destruction of evidence. 
Melanie Grey, appointed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York to represent Enron in its bankruptcy filing, objected to Judge Harmon issuing an order concerning documents related to that case. Such an order needs to come from the bankruptcy court, she said. 

Nearly 50 attorneys gathered in the Houston courtroom Tuesday to tell Judge Harmon their opinions on preserving and protecting Andersen documents related to civil suits filed by investors who lost hundreds of millions of dollars through Enron stocks and bonds. 
Bill Lerach, representing the Regents of the University of California and Amalgamated Bank, said Andersen can no longer be trusted with evidence in the Enron case. 
As a result of its work for Waste Management Inc., Andersen last year was hit by the biggest fine ever levied by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Lerach said. 
Judge Harmon presided over a class-action lawsuit brought against Waste Management by some of its investors. 
The accounting firm was also enjoined last June from ever again violating federal securities laws because of its work for Waste Management, Lerach said. Still, Andersen admitted last month that some of its employees had shredded documents relating to the Enron account. 
Andersen employees involved in the Waste Management case attended a meeting last January when Andersen executives in Houston and the firm's Chicago headquarters discussed dropping Enron as a client because of possible accounting problems. The firm decided at that time to stick with Enron. 
Lerach also displayed a box overflowing with strips of paper, which he said were documents shredded recently by Enron employees. The shredding by Anderson and Enron weren't separate occurrences, but were done with joint knowledge by the two companies, he said. 
He called for all Andersen documents to be impounded by the judge and guarded by U.S. marshals. He also asked the judge to appoint experts who could oversee recovery of any e-mails or other electronic evidence that had been deleted by Andersen.

HOUSTON (AP) - A judge prodded parties in a lawsuit against Enron Corp. on Tuesday to work out a plan to halt the destruction of documents. FBI agents, meanwhile, were dispatched to Enron headquarters to investigate new allegations of document shredding. 
""This is the shredded evidence that we got out of Enron,"" attorney William Lerach said as he carried a box of paper shreds into the courthouse.
The hearing before U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon was primarily on a previous request to ban any shredding by Enron's former auditor, Arthur Andersen. 
She asked plaintiffs and Andersen to discuss the problem and get back to her Wednesday. As for Enron, Lerach said he wants to take depositions from company chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay and others about the allegations made public Monday of shredding at the company. 
Enron bankruptcy attorney Melanie Gray argued that any rulings on taking custody of Enron's own documents must come from the New York bankruptcy court handling the company's Chapter 11 filing. 
FBI agents were inside Enron's 50-story headquarters building Tuesday morning looking into the latest allegations accusing Enron employees themselves, not just Andersen, of destroying documents. Company spokesman Mark Palmer said they were on site at the request of attorneys for the collapsed energy trading company. 
""We proactively offered our full cooperation in any investigation the Department of Justice might wish to conduct,"" Palmer said. He said the company thinks ""such an investigation is properly done by federal authorities, not plaintiffs' counsel for benefit of a lawsuit."" 
Lerach represents shareholders suing 29 current and former Enron executives and directors. 
A state judge's order already prohibits Andersen's Houston office from shredding Enron-related documents. Chicago-based Andersen acknowledged earlier this month its Houston office had destroyed a significant but undetermined amount of audit-related work.

FBI searching Enron offices
Reports of shredding prompt agents' move in Houston

By Allen Wan, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 1:47 PM ET Jan. 22, 2002
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) - FBI agents are combing Enron's Houston office for evidence of possible document shredding. 
The news comes a day after day after former employees alleged the now-bankrupt energy trader continued to shred boxes of documents this month despite federal subpoenas and court orders issued back in October forbidding the practice. 
Enron rebutted the claim.
Meanwhile, a federal judge in Houston will hear a request for expedited discovery into Andersen's role in the document shredding. Andersen was Enron's longtime auditor. 
A congressional subcommittee will hold a hearing Thursday into the destruction of Enron-related documents by Andersen personnel.
Shares of Enron slid nearly 20 percent to 41 cents in recent action. 
On Monday, Maureen Castaneda, the former director of Enron's foreign investments section, told ABC News in an interview that the shredding of documents began after Thanksgiving on the 19th floor in an accounting office and continued through at least early January. 
""I left the second week of January, and the shredding was going on until the day I left, and I have no idea if it continues,"" said Castaneda. 
""After Thanksgiving, there was great interest in the accounting documents stored,"" she said. ""They pulled out all the boxes, and people had to go through every box."" 
During the report, Castaneda showed shredded documents containing the word ""Jedi,"" which is believed to be one of the entities involved in the secret, off-the-books partnerships that kept hundreds of millions of dollars in Enron debt off its balance sheet for several years. 
Enron issued a statement late Monday in reaction to the report, saying that employees had been warned in four separate emails from Oct. 25 through Jan. 14 to preserve all documents and materials. 
The SEC began investigating Enron in mid-October, the Associated Press reported.
""Enron's communications with its employees were very clear on the destruction of documents, and any breach of the company's policy will be dealt with swiftly and severely,"" the company said in the statement. 
""Enron has been cooperating fully with congressional investigators and handed over to various government investigators 41 boxes of documents and materials.""
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer confirmed that an internal investigation was under way to determine whether employees had ignored the warning. 
""We don't know the significance or even pertinence of the materials that were said to have been shredded,"" he said. ""All we know is what we told employees.""
At least 10 congressional committees and the Department of Justice are also investigating Enron's meltdown and Andersen's role as auditor for the formerly highflying energy trader.
Andersen, one of the Big Five accounting firms, has admitted to destroying documents related to Enron's finances and fired the partner who was its lead auditor of Enron books.

Enron Document Shredding to Be Probed by Justice, SEC

By Jef Feeley 
Houston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The federal government is expanding its criminal and civil investigations into the collapse of Enron Corp. by looking into the shredding of documents at the energy trader. 
Enron workers were shredding documents in an accounting office at the company's Houston headquarters as recently as two weeks ago, a former Enron executive, Maureen Castaneda, told ABC News. Both the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating Enron-related matters for about three months. 
Both agencies already had been investigating document shredding at Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, in October and November. At least 10 congressional committees also are looking into Enron matters, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee has asked Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino to testify about the document destruction on Thursday. 
``The shredding is over'' at Arthur Andersen, Rusty Hardin, a lawyer for the accounting firm, said in court today in Houston. ``What was done by some people was a mistake in judgment.'' He said Andersen is cooperating with the federal investigation. 
The Justice Department inquiry into the new allegations was disclosed in Houston federal court by Enron lawyer Ken Marks. He said company officials discovered a bag of shredded documents at its Houston headquarters. Lawyers for shareholders suing the company sought a court order today to prevent more shredding. 
FBI Presence 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent agents to Enron's headquarters today to interview employees about the shredding, Marks said. The company put security guards on the 19th floor of its headquarters last night after hearing of the ABC report. Access to the floor is closed and the area is being checked for evidence of shredding, he said. 
William Lerach, a lawyer representing shareholders suing Enron, said the presence of FBI agents may make a court order to protect documents superfluous. 
``I'd be surprised if there is any more shredding,'' he told reporters outside the courthouse in Houston. 
Lerach, without mentioning names, said he expects ``other institutions and firms are going to be named as defendants'' in the shareholders' suit. 
Enron's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, is under investigation by congressional committees for its role in advising the energy trader. The firm conducted an internal investigation into claims made in August by an employee who said accounting irregularities threatened Enron. 
Obstruction 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's expanded role was disclosed by SEC Enforcement Director Stephen Cutler. 
``To the extent there was or is document destruction going on elsewhere, including Enron, that would come within the scope of our investigation as well,'' Cutler told a news conference today. 
Destroying documents that might be sought in an investigation that has already begun might constitute obstruction of justice, white-collar defense lawyers have said. 
Castaneda, a former director of Enron's foreign investments section, described her activities in the ABC interview. 
``I left the second week of January and the shredding was going on until the day I left,'' she said. She showed the network boxes of the shredded documents, some of which had the word ``confidential'' on them. 
Two other employees also saw trash bags full of shredded documents in the same vicinity of the office in November, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
Enron is investigating the shredding, company attorney Robert Bennett told the Journal. Enron said it has told employees ``in no uncertain terms'' since Oct. 25 to preserve all documents related to company partnerships. Four e-mails to that effect were sent to workers from Oct. 25 to Jan. 14, the company statement said. 
Enron will take ``swift action'' against any employee who shredded documents, said company spokesman Mark Palmer. 
Shareholder Suits 
Enron shareholders are suing the company, once the world's No. 1 energy trader, and Arthur Andersen, the fifth largest U.S. accounting firm. The suit claims that Enron and its accountants hid some $600 million in losses from investors, triggering the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
The Justice Department and FBI declined to comment about the investigation. 
Arthur Andersen last week fired David Duncan, a Houston partner who supervised the Enron audit, for destroying documents. Duncan said he was following directions from a senior lawyer at Andersen's Chicago headquarters, a claim denied by the accounting firm. 
``There may be an innocent explanation for some of the shredding,'' said Andersen's Hardin. ``There may not be'' for other instances. ``Arthur Andersen has not intentionally violated the law.'' 
Arthur Andersen kept about 150 employees at Enron's headquarters to handle the account. More than half of its $52 million in Enron-related fees last year came from consulting and other non-audit work. Accounting experts and lawmakers say the risk of losing business may make an auditor reluctant to confront a client about accounting irregularities. 
Andersen handled internal auditing at Enron from 1994 through 1998, a service some industry experts said may pose a conflict of interest because the accounting firm's also was the external auditor. 

FBI Securing Rest Of Enron Documents 
Enron Accused Of Shredding Documents
Posted: 7:53 a.m. CST January 22, 2002
Updated: 1:33 p.m. CST January 22, 2002
KPRC, Channel 2, Houston
HOUSTON -- FBI agents moved into the Enron Corp. building in downtown Tuesday, conducting an investigation into allegations of new shredding of documents. 
Details of the new shredding were announced late Monday in Houston by some lawyers suing on behalf of investors. 
One of the attorneys, William Lerach, said that document shredding went on long after federal regulators began investigating the energy company's collapse. 
""I think we may have stumbled upon an attempt to destroy critical evidence in one of the largest financial frauds in the history of our nation,"" Lerach said. 
He said ""hundreds of thousands"" of documents were destroyed at Enron's Houston headquarters -- as recently as Jan. 14. 
Lerach brought a box of shredded documents into a federal courthouse in Houston on Tuesday. 
He asked a judge to ban any shredding by Enron or by its former auditor, the accounting firm Andersen. 
Earlier this month, Andersen acknowledged that its Houston office had destroyed a significant number of documents. 
Former Enron executive Maureen Castaneda said that she saw staffers in Enron's accounting and finance departments review and shred thousands of documents. She said it started when the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a formal investigation. 
Castaneda told morning talk shows Tuesday that the shredding began after Thanksgiving at the accounting office of the company's Houston headquarters -- and continued at least until the middle of this month. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission began looking into Enron in mid-October when the company announced huge losses. Enron filed for bankruptcy in December. 
An attorney representing Enron said the energy company is investigating the matter. The company said it repeatedly warned employees not to destroy documents. 
The Houston-based business was the nation's seventh-biggest company in revenue. Enron's downfall has hurt both individual investors and big pension funds around the country. 
Enron Manager Fired For Computer Use
An Enron manager said he deserved to be fired. 
Clayton Vernon told The New York Times he was fired for posting a message online that criticized Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay as ""the sorriest sack of garbage I have ever been associated with."" 
Vernon was at work when he posted the message using an Enron computer. He said he knew that violated company policy prohibiting personal use of computers. 

In a September in-house online chat, Vernon questioned Lay about the company's accounting practices. Lay disagreed when Vernon suggested the company was sacrificing its future for the sake of present earnings. 

Vernon is suing Enron over its business practices. 
Congressional Hearings Begin Later This Week
The first of what will be many hearings into Enron's collapse is set for Thursday. 

The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee wants to know whether federal regulators did all they could to protect investors and businesses hurt by the largest bankruptcy ever in American history. 

Over at the Senate Finance Committee, they're looking into whether Enron used tax shelters to mask its financial condition. 

A subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee also has scheduled a hearing for Thursday. The tentative witness list includes top officials from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen and David Duncan, the Andersen auditor fired last week. 

The full committee hopes to hear testimony early next month from Lay and other company officials. 
It is looking into whether Enron improperly blocked its employees from selling the Enron stock in their retirement plans.

Enron still shredding 

January 22, 2002: 11:35 a.m. ET

Former exec: Document destruction continued after subpoenas issued. 

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Ex-Enron employees are saying that possibly important documents were shredded as recently as last week at the energy trader's headquarters in Houston.

The shredding continued despite federal subpoenas and court orders since late October forbidding the practice, a former executive for the bankrupt company said Monday.

Houston-based Enron has also allowed the Federal Bureau of Investigation to interview workers located on the 19th and 20th floor of the energy trader's headquarters.

Plaintiff attorneys are asking a federal judge to assign a U.S. marshal or security team inside the building to ensure no more documents are destroyed. An initial search of the 19th floor revealed one wastebasket with shredded documents in that have been turned over to authorities.

Maureen Castaneda, who served as director of international investment for Enron, told CNNfn Tuesday morning that she took some of the shredded documents home to use as packing material before she realized what the paper contained. ""I thought, well, wait a minute -- if there's threatening legal suits, why are there still shredded documents?"" she said. 

The Wall Street Journal said Tuesday that at least two other employees said the documents shredded at Enron appear to relate to controversial partnerships used to hide debt, and that Enron's counsel said it was investigating.

Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has repeatedly told employees to preserve documents. 


Other recent developments

Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the biggest Chapter 11 filing in the history of the United States. Since then the energy company has become the subject of a criminal investigation by government regulators and other shareholder lawsuits. Recent developments include:


?  Another executive of Andersen LLP testified last week that the firm's Houston office began destroying documents after receiving an e-mail from Andersen's head office.
Michael Odom, the risk management partner responsible for the Houston office, gave testimony Friday that bolstered the account given by lead partner David Duncan last week, sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN/Money.

Odom's testimony amplifies the finger-pointing between Duncan and Andersen over who initiated the destruction of auditing documents considered vital to the investigation of Enron's bankruptcy. Details <http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/21/companies/enron_odom/>

?  Arthur Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino conceded Sunday that his company made errors but said that the energy company's demise was ultimately the result of a failed business model, not shady accounting.  ""At its base, this is an economic failure,"" said Andersen Chief Executive Officer Joseph Berardino on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

?  In a telephone interview with the New York Times, the attorney for Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay said his client repeatedly used shares of the company as collateral for other investments that he would not specify. Attorney Earl J. Silbert said Lay's decision to sell shares of Enron late last year reflected concern about the loans, and was not tied to warnings from a company vice president about Enron's financial situation.

?  Responding to severe market criticism of how it handled now-bankrupt Enron's ratings, Moody's Investors Service says it is considering making changes in how it rates companies.
The review by one of the three leading U.S. credit rating agencies -- the others are Standard & Poor's and Fitch -- follows criticism of the agencies' perceived lack of speed in downgrading energy trader Enron's ratings to junk status in November.

?  Weeks before his company filed for the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, Lay touted the energy trader's stock as an ""incredible bargain"" in a Web chat with his employees.
In a transcript of the in-house chat session, which took place Sept. 26, the Enron CEO also defended Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm recently accused of destroying key documents and covering up sizable financial losses.


FBI investigates Enron shredding 
Former employee Maureen Castaneda tells CNBC forms were shredded just last week

MSNBC STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 -  The FBI entered Enron's Houston headquarters to look for evidence that the troubled energy firm shredded financial information up to two weeks ago. Maureen Castaneda, a former employee of Enron, told CNBC on Tuesday that shredding took place into last week. Additionally, lawyers suing Enron have asked a court to step in to prevent more tampering.

       ""WE CAN CONFIRM that Department of Justice and FBI personnel are on site, conducting an investigation into the allegations raised last night,"" company spokesman Vance Meyer told Reuters.
       A former Enron employee, Maureen Castaneda, told CNBC television on Monday that documents were shredded in the Enron building up until her departure from the company in the second week of January, despite court orders forbidding the destruction of documents.
       ""It was a major accounting fraud and now they have been caught destroying the evidence,"" Lerach said Tuesday on NBC's ""Today."" ""I'd say they've got trouble on their hands."" (MSNBC is a Microsoft-NBC joint venture.)
       Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer representing Enron, said the company told employees after coming under investigation that they were not to destroy relevant documents. He said the company is looking into charges papers were destroyed despite that directive.
       Lerach said the shredding was ""open and notorious and widespread,"" consuming ""hundreds of thousands of documents."" 

       Lerach was bringing some of the shredded documents to federal court Tuesday to seek court custody of relevant Enron papers, as part of a class-action lawsuit against the company by aggrieved investors.
       ""We're going to ask the court to take extraordinary measures ... to prevent any further tampering or destruction,"" he said on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""
       ""It may be necessary that we put a U.S. marshal or someone on the premises.""
       The reported shredding follows revelations over the past two weeks about document destruction at Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor. 

Another attorney in the lawsuit, G. Paul Howes, said in court papers that some of papers destroyed at Enron headquarters were marked Jedi II and Chewco - partnerships through which the energy giant concealed hundreds of millions of dollars in debts.
       The partnerships, described by lawmakers as slick financial gimmicks, helped drive the company into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.
       The Securities and Exchange Commission began looking into Enron's accounting practices in mid-October, after the company reported more than $600 million in third-quarter losses, and a congressional committee began asking for documents in mid-December. The SEC opened a formal investigation at the end of October, including demands for financial documents from Enron and Andersen.
       Enron said in a statement late Monday that it had issued four e-mails from Oct. 25 to Jan. 14 warning employees against destroying documents, specifically those related to Enron's complex web of partnerships. 

Andersen exec denies coverup

       ""We are investigating the circumstances of the reported destruction of documents,"" Bennett said.

       Bennett said anyone who violated directives against destroying documents ""will be dealt with appropriately.""
       Castaneda, who was laid off last week, said she did not know who ordered employees to do the shredding. ""I think they were just doing what they were told,"" she said.
       She said she brought shredded paper home to use as packing material.
       The Justice Department announced on Jan. 9 that it was pursuing a criminal investigation of Enron, which entered the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2 following a six-week downward spiral.
       Andersen last week fired its lead Enron auditor for destroying Enron-related documents. The auditor, David Duncan, has told congressional investigators he was just following the advice of Andersen's legal department when he directed the shredding. 

       Lawyers for Duncan have been seeking to delay his public testimony, scheduled for Thursday before the investigative panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, saying Duncan needs more time to prepare.
       But Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., the subcommittee's chairman, rejected the request, arguing that Duncan ""doesn't really need to recall every detail of what he did for Enron. We're focused on the destruction of documents. We'll subpoena him if we have to.""
       Said Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee: ""This whole sorry affair keeps getting uglier by the minute, and we're determined to get to the bottom of it. ... Making bad business decisions is one thing, but trying to cover up bad business decisions is another."" 

       Meanwhile, a lawyer for Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said Lay disposed of millions of dollars in Enron stock before the company's collapse last year because he needed to raise cash to repay loans, not because of concerns about the health of his company.
       Attorney Earl J. Silbert said Monday Lay had put up shares of his Enron stock as collateral for other investments. On at least 15 occasions between February and October last year, Lay returned shares to the company to repay $4 million he had received through a credit line.
       However, Silbert also said that Lay held onto some stock, detailing one transaction in which Lay exercised options to purchase 68,000 shares of Enron stock on Aug. 21.
       ""He continues to hold that stock today,"" Silbert said. 

       In other developments:

   The State Department disclosed that Secretary of State Colin Powell referred to Enron's problems regarding a power plant in India in a discussion with India's foreign minister last April 6. Enron was trying to collect a $64 million debt on the project. According to the State Department, Powell said failure to resolve the matter could have a serious deterrent effect on other investors.

   New Jersey's two U.S. senators, Democrats Robert Torricelli and Jon Corzine, urged the federal government to inspect Enron's natural gas pipelines to ensure against accidents. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said ""our pipelines are inspected continuously and the hardworking men and women who have devoted their lives to the safe operations of these pipelines would have it no other way.""

   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said accounting firms should be barred from providing management consulting services to the companies they audit. ""These conflicts have led to the kind of hide-the-debt shell game that took place at Enron,"" said Boxer, who will introduce a bill to ban the dual role.

   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said a special counsel should investigate Enron rather than the Justice Department's criminal division. Nader also said Bush administration officials should have alerted the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission last fall when contacted by Enron Chairman Ken Lay about the company's growing problems.

Congress targets Enron fallout

By Matt Andrejczak, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 9:21 AM ET Jan. 22, 2002

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - The dramatic collapse of Enron and the resulting steady drumbeat of headlines last week will give lawmakers plenty to chew on when Congress returns to session on Wednesday.
News came out at a blistering pace: ""Enron employee warned Lay""-- ""Andersen fires lead auditor"" -- ""SEC unveils plan to police auditors"" -- ""Enron fires Andersen, blame game ensues -- ""White House denies Enron links.""
Ten congressional committees are investigating the impact of Enron's bankruptcy -- the largest in U.S. history. The probes range from accounting and investor protection issues to tax shelters to pension rules to federal agency accountability. 
It comes as many in Congress are attempting to distance themselves from Enron -- a big contributor to President Bush and both political parties -- and Andersen, the Big 5 accounting firm whose long-term survival is in doubt.
Both companies have become a political liability. 
A growing number of lawmakers have pledged to return their campaign donations from both companies to avoid any appearance of impropriety, especially since this year is an election year. The entire House and one-third of the Senate are up for grabs. 
When Enron flopped, Congress rushed to ask: How could the nation's seventh largest company sink in a matter of weeks? How could we have prevented it? Where were the regulators? Should we strengthen investor protection and 401 (k) laws? How can we avoid the same disaster? 
Hearings kick off early
A fresh round of hearings will begin Thursday on both sides of the Capitol. 
The House Energy and Commerce's Oversight and Investigations subcommittee will discuss the destruction of Enron-related documents by Andersen personnel. A witness list has yet to be issued.
Also, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. The panel is largely investigating whether government agencies could have prevented the Enron meltdown. 
Its focus is on the Securities and Exchange Commission; Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and the Labor Department.
Meantime, the committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is probing the actions of Enron's board and audit committee and its accountants. It issued 51 subpoenas earlier this month.
Congressional calls for Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to appear on Capitol Hill in early and mid-December were shot down due to the company's bankruptcy proceedings. 
Last week the release of internal memos by congressional investigators shed some light on what Lay knew and when he knew it. 
Lay makes his first appearance
As it stands, the Senate Commerce Committee -- headed by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. -- will get the first crack at Lay on Feb. 4. 
What about former Enron finance chiefs Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow? That is still unclear. 
They were also no-shows at the committee's Dec. 18 hearing, where former Enron employees detailed how their retirement savings were wiped out due to the company's sudden collapse.
The bigger and more looming question is if Lay will request to testify before Congress using ""limited immunity."" 
If granted, the Justice Department won't be able to use Lay's testimony against him in their criminal investigation.
Retired Marine lieutenant colonel Oliver North escaped prosecution in the Iran/Contra scandal due to limited immunity. 
So far, Lay has not requested immunity, according to Senate Commerce spokesman Nu Wexler. 
The House Financial Services Committee is also gunning for Lay, who may possibly appear before the panel on Feb. 4 as well. It doesn't plan to offer Lay limited immunity.
""We don't anticipate we would do so,"" said House Financial Services spokeswoman Peggy Peterson. ""It [limited immunity] could impede the Justice Department's investigation or others.""
And still more
On Jan. 29, the Senate Energy Committee will explore the impact of Enron's bankruptcy on consumers and the energy markets. 
The Senate Banking Committee will step into the fold on Feb. 12.
Some of its members told the SEC two years ago to back down from a proposal to strengthen auditor independence rules designed to eliminate potential conflicts of interest that sparked Enron's crazy spiral.
And they will be the same ones pondering if tougher accounting and investor protection rules need to be drafted following the Enron debacle. Such senators include Rick Santorum, R-Pa., Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Robert Bennett, R-Utah, and Phil Gramm, R-Tex., whose wife Wendy, served on Enron's board.
Set to appear before the committee are five former chairmen of the SEC: Roderick Hills (1975-1977); Harold Williams (1977-1981); David Ruder (1987-1989); Richard Breeden (1989-1993); and Arthur Levitt, the target of criticism from the committee for his auditor independence proposal.
The SEC eventually passed a watered down version of its original auditor independence rule November 2000.
One committee member, Sen. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., will certainly take aim at the SEC's recently unveiled plan to police the accounting industry. The former Goldman Sachs partner is calling for more direct SEC oversight, rather than a new private sector entity.
""At the end of the day, a private sector organization will be largely dependent on the accounting industry for its survival. That is unacceptable,"" Corzine said. ""We shouldn't rely on the fox to guard the hen house. It's time for the SEC to assume this responsibility.""
This month Senate Banking Chairman Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., requested that the General Accounting Office evaluate investing employee retirement funds in company stock and the adequacy of financial reporting in the United States.

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.",,,LJM the Securities and Exchange Commission

    The view now is to minimize costs and move toward a sale of our A to B rights as a withdrawn partner to WMB or TCPL, or we may negotiate a deal that would allow us a back in intertest if we pay a promote at a given point in the future.

Julie Armstrong (x33597) should be able to give you company/cost center for the move charges. Julie requested setting up this move after Linda Wehring's return next Monday, so request middle of next week churn date. Please also check with Linda (x36040) on Monday to see if she has anything to add to this request. Since this is not his primary office, there will not be very much to move other than equipment and furniture. Also should check 1354 to see if there is a marker board in there already or if we need to move one in there for him. 

Pat, could you please outfit ECN1354 with VP style furniture (granite racetrack, Mueller chairs, black drum table, along with Barritt guest chairs if they are not already in there) before next week? This will prevent moving the furniture from level 39, then having to replace it when I back-fill the office next week.

recent trip to Sao Paulo, many of the ag products came up in meetings as good 
opportunities for Enron to go in and change that industry.  Coffee, Orange

D'Arcy may have traded an ag book for Cargill, I can't remember.

3501,"Note:  Add this to the NOAA and Salomon Smith Barney forecasts.  LB
WSI Sees Mild Winter in Northeast, Cold in West 
In contrast to forecasts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Salomon Smith Barney of a colder-than-normal winter in key energy consuming regions, WSI Corp.'s end-of-October update to its seasonal forecast for November, December and January predicts warmer-than-normal temperatures in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and in the central and southern Plains. WSI, however, said it expects cooler-than-normal temperatures in the Gulf Coast states, Northern Plains, Great Lakes states, and all areas west of the Rocky Mountains. 
""The expectation of below-normal temperatures in the north-central United States during the November-January period is similar to the Oct.18th [NOAA] outlook,"" said Todd Crawford, a WSI seasonal forecaster. ""The most significant difference in our outlooks is that we expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in the Northeast during the period while CPC is forecasting cooler-than-normal."" 
WSI sees the following monthly trends: 
In November, cooler-than-normal temperatures are expected in the western half of the United States, the Northern Plains, and Florida, while warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected across the central and southern Plains and most of the eastern United States. 
In December, cooler-than-normal temperatures are anticipated across much of the country, with the exception of the Southeast, New England, and parts of the Central Rockies. WSI sees numerous Arctic outbreaks to affect the northern Plains states during the month. 
In January, WSI forecasts warmer-than-normal temperatures across the Central and Southern Plains, central Rockies, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic States. Cooler-than-normal temperatures are expected along the Pacific Coast, in the Southwest, Northern Rockies and Northern Plains, and in the Ohio Valley. 
WSI said its three-month seasonal forecasts have been accurate for seven straight periods, and nine out of the last 12. An accurate seasonal forecast is defined as one that is closer to what is actually observed versus a forecast that uses the 30-year average temperature, it said. 
Energy Security Analysis Inc. (ESAI) said the latest WSI forecast for milder temperatures is bearish for gas and power prices. ESAI also said, however, that in the WSCC the outlook for cooler-then-average conditions will translate into higher levels of heating demand. Due to recent poor hydro-generation conditions, power supplies in regions like the Pacific Northwest and northern California could be limited, in which case higher levels of weather-induced demand are likely to bring stronger power prices.

In response to your request listed below: We have included a few questions related to your wells pressures and flow rates.
Please let us know if we can be of further service. Thanks Dennis Alters  

I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to drilled. I work with Lori Vining at Beacon Petroleum and I am trying to find Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:
Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land
I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure I get it right.
I would appreciate any help.
Thank you for time,

the tournament (but of course I haven't played it!).  The azaleas were not at

What a great tournament.

There were two such events.  On the Scott McNelly side, I realized that we 
weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view on 
technology.  None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all 
plus when someone of the caliber and reputation of McNelly gives you a 
general approval and confirmation, as a new guy, that meant a lot.  It 
inspired me to keep going on a ""nontraditional"" path.  The other big  impact 
moment was listening and having a brief conversation with John Chambers of 
Cisco.  It was at the eCommerce Summit in Washington DC and he gave his, ""its 
a matter of survival"" speech.  That really hit me and our conversation was 
also similar about my new job and Enron's new approach.  He gave me a 
positive response and also gave me some advice that included an observation 
that the incumbent IT people may not have the abilities to help me lead Enron 
in the eCommerce world.  It was going to take a different kind of 
technologist.  That moment had the most impact on me of the two.   I saw John 
again and spoke with him at an Economist  conference in Laguna Nigel and told 
him of his original impact and I think he appreciated the story.  He also was 
very nice to give me some time to talk after that speech as well.

I hope that clarified things,  good luck with the piece.

Thanks,
mike

I did talk to Skilling about this.  I must have forgotten to call you.  Jeff 
really does want it around, you were correct.  Is there a compromise solution 
here?  Maybe a smaller room with a control center vs an entire floor?  Think 
about items like that and lets discuss.  At this point in time, lets not 
assume we have the option to move it from the new building, at least not all 
of it.  One key consideration is the cost savings by moving it to Ardmore.  
How much will it really save?  Those numbers a long with all the other points 
might bring clarity to what we should do.

I am still interested in selling the car; I have a couple driving in from
Austin next weekend who are really serious about buying the car. I started a
new business (see below) and need a 4 door car.

The specifications:

1998 Porsche Boxster, Metallic Blue, Black top with black interior, 23,400
miles, $37,500, 17"" wheels, CD player, cruise control, heated mirrors, power
seats, automatic climate control, factory alarm, 5-speed, power top, power
windows, remote trunk release, gold Porsche badges (on wheels as well).

Performance:  0-60 mph 6.4 seconds / 150 mph top speed / 201 hp 2.5 liter
flat six engine

Errol - if you are interested let me know ASAP; Jennifer (Austin couple) is
pretty serious about the purchase. I also have a 1995 Triumph Speed Triple
with 8,200 miles (bought new in 8/96) that I am looking to sell for $4,800.
Comes with lots of accessories.

The story:

I bought the car in 10/99 with 5,300 from West Side Infiniti (Houston). An
older gentleman traded in the car for a Q45 (he had the Porsche for a year;
had a hard time getting in and out of the car). The record (call Momentum
Porsche in Houston - all record on file) show that the car had an oil change
at 2,000 miles, 4,200 miles, 14,000 miles (15,000 mile check up). The car
currently has 23,400 miles on it. I have had no problems with the car and is
in perfect running condition.

The original Pirelli P-Zero's lasted me until 21,555 (quite a feat
considering that they run out at 14,000 - 18,000 miles). I replaced the
tires with Pirelli P7000 Super Sports (better 4 season tire and longer tread
life without sacrificing handling). I also had the shop align the car to
factory settings.

The car has been garaged all of the time. I used to work in downtown and
live in downtown so the car barely was driven during the weekdays. The car
is driven more on a daily basis. I used to own a BMW Z3 so taking care of
German cabriolets is comes second hand. The car has never been in a wreck
and is in perfect condition in every aspect. The interior color is black and
again in perfect condition. Please let me if you are interested and I will
be more than happy to let you test drive the car or take it to your mechanic
for an inspection (or arrange a screening with one of the Porsche dealers to
inspect the car).

Please feel free to contact me at either numbers below.

3589,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

3594,"We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=

America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=

Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=

commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=

efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=

to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) 
project status:

?  TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
?  TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be 
presented to the traders. 
?  Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV 
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's 
reports.
?  We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early 
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to 
publish their region's reports.
?   At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the 
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region 
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
?  Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review 
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and 
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production 
environment.

Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th

iBuyit.  One of the special iBuyit components is an automated accounts 
payable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices. 

As of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and
? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus
? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or 
approved; and
? view an electronic image of the actual invoice

These improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce 
the time you spend processing invoices for payment.  The AP tool will also 
begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information 
currently in use.  

This tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP 
processing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions.  This transition 
is expected to be completed by August 2001.

You will hear more about the iBuyit initiative, features of the AP tool and

organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <

3652,"Dear Real Timers,

As I have been having to pull tapes lately, I cannot stress enough the 
importance of stating the hour for which you are trading when you make 
deals.  It is imperative that you state (as often as possible) the hours that 
you are trading for, and it is extremely helpful when you re-cap the sale at 
the end of your trade!! :) please...

There may be deals that we are going to loose the dispute for because neither 
trader (on either side) stated clearly what hour we were trading for. I'm 
relying on you guys to help me collect 100% on all our trades.

Please see or e-mail me with any questions.

Thanks.

Virginia

resale prices on the phone.  These prices need to be recorded in your trade 
log.  We also need to now check the prices nightly on buy-resales with 
Pacificorp when doing the SAR.  We are having numerous discrepancies with

   Word of the Day for Friday April 5, 2002:

   proclivity \pro-KLIV-uh-tee\, noun:
   A natural inclination; predisposition.

     New  York  City  is  full  of  people  like  Mr.  O'Neal --
     life-long  bibliophiles with a proclivity for accumulation,
     holed  up  in  compact  spaces  in  the intimate company of
     thousands upon thousands upon thousands of books.
     --""For  Some,  Acquiring  Books  Has  Become a Compulsion,""
     [1]New York Times, July 6, 1997

     Those  close  to Clark from childhood were not surprised at
     how   quickly   he   recognized   the  lucrative  financial
     opportunities commercial announcing afforded, for Clark had
     demonstrated a proclivity for entrepreneurship as a youth.
     --John  A.  Jackson,  [2]American Bandstand: Dick Clark and
     the Making of a Rock 'n' Roll Empire
     _________________________________________________________

   Proclivity  comes  from  Latin  proclivitas,  from  proclivis,
   ""inclined,"" from pro-, ""forward"" + clivus, ""a slope.""

I'm writing to tell you that our negotiations with the 
International Association of Machinists (IAM) District 
141M have produced a tentative agreement on a contract, 
ensuring no disruption of service to United customers.

This has been a difficult time, and I want to thank you 
for your understanding and continued support.

IAM District 141M will forward the details of the 
tentative agreement to its membership for a vote within 
the next two weeks.

This decision allows us to continue focusing on serving 
you, and I hope it renews your confidence in planning 
your travel with United. We look forward to seeing you 
on board.

Thank you,

Physical: 9,773
Financial: -55,173
Net MTM = -45,400

This is new to have an Index Forward w/ Delivery at a Basis and the Index at the Basis.
Portcalc is valuing the physical risk from the physical delivery price, while the financial risk is from the financial index curve (Palo Verde): 


 Index Offset = .50
  Physical Basis = .50
  Price for Palo is 17.25

  Physical

  MidPrice = Physical Curve * Scalar = (Palo + Mead Basis) * Scalar = 17.75 * Scalar
  FixedPrice = MidPrice + index Offset = MidPrice + 0.5

  Financial

  MidPrice = Index Curve * Scalar = Palo * Scalar = 12.25 * Scalar
  FixedPrice = Physical MidPrice


This shouldn't take to long to fix the financial MidPrice to pull Mead - I will keep you updated on the progress.

Attached is the current deal summary.

3717,"Scott asked for some assistance on the booking of the LGS deal and the impact 
it would have if we unwound certain hedges. To help me better understand the 
impact this would have, I need to understand the way we originally booked the 
deal.   David, you and I have talked about this some, but I still don't have 
all the info I need.  (Let me know if Scott, Craig and Farzad have already 
figured all this out and I'll drop it, but to my knowledge they still need 
help figuring this all out).  Hopefully my thoughts outlined below will help 
you understand what I'm looking for and why.

As I understand the LGS deal, ENA pays an annual $1.35 MM to utilize the 
assets, including storage; ENA gets to keep value generated (including 
summer/winter spread) up to $1.5MM, then it is shared 50/50; however, LGS has 
to know about and agree with any hedges we put on to lock in a particular 
spread.  When Structuring booked this deal in January, summer/winter spreads 
were locked in for the entire period we have the deal (through 2003); 
however, it is my understanding that LGS has only been made aware of the 
front year hedges (which I understand have been changed around a bit since 
the beginning and that's o.k.).    

What I need to know is--how was this deal booked?  When the $1.35 MM payment 
goes to LGS, is that covered through the hedges that were put on?  How 
exactly do the dollars flow between books?

I think this will help us figure out what would fall out If Scott removes 
certain forward hedges and what risk he would take on.  It seems to me that 
he would be at risk for whatever spread we had locked in originally, but I'm 
not sure exactly how this would show up.  Basically, it seems as if Scott is 
at risk with the hedges on, that if the actual spread is wider by the time 
LGS is informed of the injection/withdrawal schedule (or LGS begins pushing 
us to put on hedges), he would lose; likewise, it seems that if he takes the 
hedges off and the actual spread comes in tighter, he would lose.  
Conversely, if he takes the hedges off and the actual spread comes in wider, 
I think he would win.  Anyway, I want to get together on Monday and go over 
this with the three of you and figure this all out.  Please let me know if 
10:00 Monday morning (7/31) works for you, then I'll ask Kim to get a

3736,"Last year money was to be set aside in reserves to cover the net amount needed
to resolve these issues with Transco, BUG , LILCO and Enron.  The total 
dollars
required was approximately $4.25 million.  An amount of $3.55 million needed 
for 
the Transco historical imbalance resolution.  The remaining balance was needed
for the BUG and LILCO accounting issues that Keyspan brought to our attention 
last year.

Bob Hall has $3.5 million reserved in his area for the Transco historical 
imbalance.
The remaining $50,000 for Transco and approximately $700,000 of additional 
funds
for the accounting issues were to be reserved last year under ""The Office of 
the
Chairman"".  Sally Beck and Janet Dietrich arranged for this additional money 
to
be reserved at the ""Chairman"" level since the additional funds were needed to 
correct an old accounting problem that should not hit the East Desk P&L.  
Also, the 
arrangement was that the reserve would be maintained until the settlement

were made by Enron.

As with most stories, there is some good news and some bad news.  First, the

Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction
Process With FERC

FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative 
regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity
auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process.

In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for 
selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. 
The filing
was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is 
consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which
encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' 
to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637,
Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance 
filing made June 15.

``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party 
that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of
Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we 
conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often
wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current 
process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the 
auction is
closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''

According to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving 
to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into
consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in 
capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term
contracts.

Under Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via 
its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm 
capacity.
Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the 
quantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted
capacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if 
Columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with 
a
different term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a 
present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time 
before a
binding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.

Columbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles 
outlined in FERC's Order 637. 

    *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will
          begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be
          posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST).
    *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-
          discriminatory basis.
    *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing
          EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be
          made available on the Internet.
    *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since
          bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to
          each capacity package made available.
    *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's
          identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection
          criteria were applied.
    *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all
          bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to
          all bidders through an Internet-based system.


``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity 
auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all 
parties
as well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.

Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is 
based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for
transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to 
withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.

Columbia Gas Transmission, with offices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax, 
Va., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to
markets along a 12,550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10 
Midwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The company operates one
of the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240 
billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working capacity.

Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading 
energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its
operating companies engage in nearly all phases of the natural gas business, 
including exploration and production, transmission, storage and distribution,
as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum product sales, and 
electric power generation. Information about Columbia Energy Group
(NYSE: CG - news) is available on the Internet at

3756,"I spoke with Kent Harris at Wildhorse today and he stated there position to 
me on a few things.

1.  Our Interruptible noms to NWPL for Wed. were not cut due to contractual 
reasons, we were cut due to a lack of capacity.  He said that the San Arroyo 
#2 compressor was down and without it they cannot make additional deliveries 
to NWPL.  They hope to have it up by friday and will try to provide us some 
capacity into NWPL.

2.  Kent reiterated their position regarding our contract by stating that 
""the intent of the original contract was not to take gas through other 
systems other than the Mesa system"".  In addition he stated that we do not 
have the right to choose which pipeline our gas is delivered to.

3.  He also asked whether or not we were willing to negotiate on the current 
situation or if we wanted to let the 'lawyers fight it out"".  I reiterated 
that we have been waiting for them to either acknowledge that they will 
gather the entrada gas under the current contract or provide us with another 
alternative.  Absent either of those 2 things happening all we can do is try 
to live by the existing agreement.  He stated that they have new estimates on 
the cost to construct a new line through the South Canyon and it is 
approximately $1MM less than their original esitmate.

We left it that he would determine whether or not they would gather  the 
Entrada under the existing contract or make a new proposal that would most 
likely wrap the Entrada and Dakota up under one new deal and replace the 
existing contract.

I told him we would determine whether or not we wanted to ""let the lawyers 
fight over the existing contract"" or work on a new deal for all the 
production.

P.S.  They are still very interested in some type of Joint Venture.

an open season; however, this product is for capacity release, which would 
not be subject to an open season--only bidding.  So, Gerald, unless you have 
some objection that we have overlooked, I believe it is appropriate to remove 
the words ""or open season"" in the product description.  Regarding the GTC, 
since we were planning on eliminating Paragraph 3 anyway, which had the open 
season reference, I think that one is already taken care of.

The other question she had is how we would define the following terms and how 
they would be made a part of the contract:  Reference Pipeline, Rate

monitoring wells be installed at the 2 cogen sites.  Question that comes up

1.  Breaking up would be a lot easier. A smack to the ass and a

3.  Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29th so it would

But it would be celebrated every month.

6.  Garbage would take itself out.

7.  Regis and Kathie Lee would be chained to a cement mixer and
pushed off the Golden Gate Bridge for the most lucrative pay-per-view event
in world history.

8.  The only show opposite ""Monday Night Football"" would be
""Monday Night Football from a Different Camera Angle.""

9.  Instead of ""beer-belly,"" you'd get ""beer-biceps.""

10. Tanks would be far easier to rent.

11. Two words...""Ally McNaked.""

12. When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you
responded with would actually reduce your fine. As in: Cop: ""You know how
fast you were going?""   You: ""All I know is, I was spilling my beer all

you returned it the following day with a full tank of gas.

18. Instead of a fancy, expensive engagement ring, you could
present your wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said ""You're #1!"".

19. When your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during
the game, she'd appear in a little box in the corner of the screen during
a time-out.

20. Nodding and looking at your watch would be deemed as an
acceptable response to ""I love you.""

21. The funniest guy in the office would get to be CEO.

22. ""Sorry I'm late, but I got wasted last night,"" would be an
acceptable excuse for tardiness.

23. At the end of the workday a whistle would blow and you
would jump out of your window and slide down the tail of a brontosaurus and
right into your car like Fred Flintstone.

I found out today that ENA did not really negotiate the ICE agreement as it was not contemplated at the time that trading would actually take place on the site.  If it is contemplated that ENA Upstream will actually trade on the site, it is possible we will need to negotiate changes to the forms.  Please let me know if ENA UC intendes to trade.

Thanks.

I called our Credit Group to look into how large Enron's corporate guaranty is with the Duke pipelines (i.e. TETCO and Algonquin) to make sure that we will pass the credit check that will occur when the capacity is released to us.  Two counter-parties, ENA and ENA Upstream, are set up to do capacity release and other transport deals with Duke with a maximum guaranty of $16 million.  TETCO has ENA down for$1.7 million that has to cover three months of demand charges.  ENA has no other TETCO capacity at the present time, so there should be no problems passing TETCO's automatic credit check during the capacity release process.

Please note that for the two structures we just discussed, the capacity needs to be both recallable and reputtable.  If Yankee and Legal gets comfortable with the other features of the proposed structure, the gas sales price should also include the TETCO commodity cost reimbursement when Yankee calls on the gas and ENA elects to not re-release the capacity back to Yankee.

I will be back on Tuesday.  If you need to get me on Friday or Monday, page me at 1-877-347-3186.

said that the items that were on item B on my issues schedule for Natural Gas 
Revenues for $989k were ENA paying Northern Border.  The $309k in item F were 
Northern Border paying ENA.  This would change the post closing adjustment by 
a net of about $680k.  I will work through the new calculation with the items 
identified.

Also, he said that he thought ENA's Gas accounting group, Scott Sitter and 
someone from Denver should meet to go through the adjustments and payments 
that have gone through since the closing.  This could affect the post closing 
calculation with fairly significant dollars and would be information that I

NOFX deliver punk with panache 
NOFX (House of Blues; 1,000 capacity; $22.50) 
By Troy J. Augusto 
HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - If there's one band that modern punk-rock concert-goers 
can always count on for a good time, it's L.A.'s NOFX, whose fusion of 
musical influences and tightly delivered mix of humor and melody leaves most 
other bands in their dust. 
At the second of three sold-out House of Blues shows on Sunday, the 
three-chord quartet, which formed in the Bay Area in the mid-1980s, showed 
the result of years of nonstop touring by ripping through an action-packed 
hour-plus set. 
The all-ages gig featured a fan-approved selection of popular catalog songs 
(``Linoleum,'' ``Don't Call Me White,'' ``It's My Job to Keep Punk Rock 
Elite,'' ``The Brews'') from their many independently released albums and 
EPs, each generating the usual mosh-pit activities on the dance floor. (Venue 
security types were busy all night ejecting the rabble-rousers.) 
The set list was rounded out with a few choice cuts from last year's 
excellent ``Pack Up the Valuum'' (Epitaph) collection, like the twisted love 
tune ``Pharmacist's Daughter,'' about a guy who dates a girl so he can get 
drugs from her daddy, ``What's the Matter With Parents Today'' and 
``Louise,'' one of bassist-singer Fat Mike's many graphic tributes to 
lesbians. 
Besides the humor, band stands out from the pack with impressive vocal 
harmonies (even as they sing ``kill all the white man''), outstanding 
songwriting, and the players' aptitude on their instruments, not exactly a 
strength for most punk outfits. Four or five songs even boasted guitarist El 
Hefe blowing smooth on trumpet. 
Playful show ended with the new album's final track, ``Theme From a NOFX 
Album,'' an autobiographical party limerick with an ``oom-pah-pah'' flow that 
pretty much summed up the band's fortunes. ``We're professional punkers, we 
come from the suburbs, after 15 years we're still having fun.'' 
Presented inhouse. Band: Fat Mike, Eric Melvin, El Hefe, Erik Ghint. Opened 
Feb. 24, 2001, reviewed Feb. 25, closed Feb. 26.

I will hand deliver to your office an Interconnect Agreement which has been 
executed by Chambers Energy.   The Chambers Energy Project is the IPP to be 
built on the east side of the Houston Loop which has a peak load requirement 
for Phase I of 270 MMCFD and the parent company is American National Power.

The Interconnect costs will be paid by Chambers and the fixed price amount is 
stipulated in the Agreement.  The Interconnect is an independent agreement, 
however, it will become a part of the body of agreements that will be 
executed between ENA/HPL and Chambers for the plant.  As you are aware we 
have a construction proposal in front of Chambers to build laterals to this 
plant including the lateral to HPL.  Chambers has awarded the work to HPL and 
they are currently indicating that the construction contract would be 
executed by the end of this month.  

HPL will operate the interconnect.  The pipeline and meter are listed in the 
Interconnect Agreement as Chambers Facilities.  This is because the pipeline 
and meter station will be built and paid for by Chambers under the 
construction contract.  The intent is that, after construction,  Chambers 
will then turn over the facilities to HPL for operation and control as part 
of the transport and/or commodity deals.  We have agreed to execute the 
Interconnect Agreement because it will become part of the body of work needed 
by Chambers to finalize thier financing, i.e. ""proof"" of a supplier.

3893,"Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has ""own"" or ""owner""
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on ""Apply"", then ""OK"".

6.	Right click on your ""Calendar"" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!

Many of you have asked about procedures to evaluate employee performance.  We are finalizing a performance process designed to track and provide feedback on individual accomplishments for the benefit of each employee, the company and the unsecured creditors' committee.  A very simple and straight-forward online performance assessment system (PAS) will allow us to automate parts of the process.  

PAS will open next week on Monday, May 13, and remain open through Friday, May 24, 2002.  As an employee of a debtor company, you should access the system and complete your self assessment by Friday, May 17, 2002.  Your supervisor will review and approve submitted accomplishments and schedule a face-to-face meeting to discuss your contributions, offer feedback, set priorities for the upcoming period, discuss challenges and potential development opportunities, and if applicable, confirm your quarterly retention payout and project a target for the upcoming quarter.  

PAS will be accessible through the HR Global Launch Zone.  We'll send a reminder with more details next week.  In the meantime, if you have questions about the process you can contact your HR Representative. ",,,PAS

Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

Dear PIRA Retainer Client,
To those of you who attended last  week's Annual Retainer Client Seminar, thank you for making the trip to New York  and for helping us make the Seminar an unqualified success.  I think PIRA consultants and clients  alike were reassured by the robust turnout and the overall enthusiasm that  accompanied the event.
As a further service to you, as well  as to those clients who could not attend in person, please note that the 2001  Seminar material (data tables and slide presentations) is available to you in  electronic format via PIRA Online. The direct link is http://www.pira.com/seminar/seminar.htm .  By end-week, we intend for the audio portion of the presentations to also be  available online.
I look forward to seeing you at next  year's seminar (tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10, 2001), if not sooner during  my travels.

Revised Operating Procedure M-401
Real-Time and Forward Intra-Zonal Congestion Management
ISO Market Participants:
On December 12, 2001 the ISO posted on its web site a version of ISO
Operating Procedure M-401 that included certain language potentially giving
the impression that the ISO determines what is and what is not a reasonable
competitive bid.  Additionally, this version of the Operation Procedure
included a provision for the exclusive use of Reliability Must-Run (RMR)
units in areas the ISO has deemed to be noncompetitive and this provision is
in conflict with the requirements of Section 4.1 of the Must-Run Service
Agreement. 
The ISO has removed the December 12, 2001 version of operating procedure
M-401 from the ISO web site and posted a revised version at
http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/opsdoc/marketops/.  The revised
version includes procedures for: 
*	Eliminating ""competitive"" and ""non-competitive"" intra-zonal
congestion areas;
*	Modifying the use of RMR units for resolving intra-zonal congestion
to reflect the requirements of the Must-Run Service Agreement;
*	Eliminating the ISO's review of market bids for ""reasonableness"",
while retaining the ISO's obligation to report bids it considers potentially
noncompetitive to the ISO's Department of Market Analysis and to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission; and  
*	Modifying the steps the ISO will take to relieve intra-zonal
congestion it predicts may occur due to pre-scheduled clearances.
The revised Operating Procedure M-401 has been posted on the ISO web site at
www.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/opsdoc/marketops.

Dynegy vs. Enron:
A ""Tale of Two Companies"" =20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
Facts: Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) beat expectations in the third quarter, repo=
rting that its earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per diluted share=
, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same period in =
2000. This represented a 22-percent increase from 3Q 2000 and boosted the c=
ompany's 2001 earnings estimate. Dynegy has a market capitalization of $14.=
5 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $43 down from a 52-week =
high of $59, although it is important to note that for year-end 2000 the co=
mpany's stock was one of the top performers among Standard & Poor's 500 com=
panies with a total shareholder return of 218 percent. Dynegy employs 5,778=
 people. =20
Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) reported $638 million in losses for the third quart=
er, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its no=
n-core businesses. The company's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-=
offs) increased 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, an=
d revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000.=
 Enron has a market capitalization of $14.8 billion. Its stock is currently=
 trading at about $16.0, which represents a six-year low for the company an=
d is considerably lower than the peak of $82 hit in August 2000. Enron empl=
oys 20,600 people. =20
Analysis: Dynegy closed out a banner year in 2000 and appears to still be o=
n a roll in terms of its financial performance. In contrast, Enron faced an=
 unprecedented year of turmoil, and is presently languishing in a low ebb, =
characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp=
any's financial reporting. While the two companies operate in the same mark=
et space of power trading and are fierce competitors, Dynegy-ironically the=
 younger and smaller of the two companies-is an industry success story whil=
e Enron's status remains rather uncertain. The questions to be addressed in=
 this article are: What is Dynegy doing ""right""? What is Enron doing ""wrong=
""? What lessons can other power and natural-gas marketers learn from this ""=
tale of two companies""?=20
Although they are often referred to as ""cross-town rivals,"" Dynegy and Enro=
n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions. Their divergent=
 approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the single-m=
ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of 20=
01. Put more simply, the two companies have vastly different strategies, an=
d-hindsight being 20/20-a strong argument can be made that Dynegy's strateg=
y is the winner at this juncture. Throughout this article, I will focus on =
two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically. Those two key =
areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi=
ch the companies have expanded (and invested) into non-core sectors.=20
Both companies started out as natural-gas companies and converged into the =
power market in the 1990s. However, that is essentially where their similar=
ities end, and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid=
edly different paths. In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary,=
 let me summarize the two paths this way: Enron does not believe it needs t=
o own physical assets to be a success in the power and natural-gas trading =
sector; Dynegy, on the other hand, not only believes in the ownership of ph=
ysical assets, but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa=
ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry. =20
Let's look at the companies separately. We'll discuss Enron first since it =
is the older of the two. Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul=
t to define, but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm=
odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers. The=
 participation and success in commodity markets, according to Enron, does n=
ot necessitate ownership of physical assets. In fact, the company has routi=
nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh=
olesale business. Rather, Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos=
ophy of risk management excellence, in which it will merely buy and sell th=
e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues. =20
As an example, Enron bought Portland General (which owns 2,000 MW of genera=
tion and 41,600 kilometers of electric T?lines) in 1996 as a way to launch =
its penetration of the West Coast power markets. When competition fizzled i=
n that region, Enron put Portland General back on the sales block (a sale o=
f Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing). Likewi=
se in Europe, where it is one of the most prominent trading companies, Enro=
n has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and, u=
nlike other U.S. competitors, has refrained from buying additional generati=
ng units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy. According to its m=
ost recent 10K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, En=
ron owns or controls 2,015 MW of generating capacity (including joint owner=
ships), which is drastically lower than the average among other companies o=
perating in the power trading sector. =20
Dynegy's approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr=
om Enron's. In the words of CEO Chuck Watson, ""Dynegy's long-term strategy =
is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets, which supports=
 earnings sustainability."" Ever since going public in 1995, Dynegy has been=
 on an acquisition binge, with each purchase significantly increasing its g=
eneration capability. Dynegy presently owns or controls about 27,000 MW of =
generating capacity in the United States, 26 gas-processing plants and 14,0=
00 miles of pipelines, which are located in geographically competitive area=
s. The company's goal is to own or control 70,000 MW, or 10 percent of the =
U.S. market, within the next five years. Sometimes, Dynegy has acquired ass=
ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy, but just =
as often it has purchased assets independently. Most notably, when Dynegy a=
cquired Illinova in early 2000, the purchase doubled Dynegy's generating ca=
pacity. Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe, wher=
e it is presently planning to purchase natural-gas storage facilities in En=
gland. Dynegy executives have argued that natural-gas storage is the best w=
ay to back up a natural-gas trading operation. There's no question that the=
 approach is working. Out of the $286 million that Dynegy reported in the t=
hird quarter, $263 million of it came from the company's main wholesale bus=
iness. =20
The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be=
tween Enron and Dynegy, and its significance should not be overlooked. It i=
s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegy's approach. Owning phys=
ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour=
se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and=
 anticipate small changes in price. In other words, by controlling the actu=
al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells, a=
 trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be=
 in a particular region, how much power can be produced to meet that load a=
nd when shortages might occur. In addition, in markets that are short on in=
frastructure, it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market=
 unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region. By t=
he same token, those companies that do control physical assets often have g=
reater communication with grid operators, and possible insight to spreads (=
the difference between various energy prices). In fact, Dynegy's CEO Watson=
 fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t=
he volatility of price, and being capable of resolving balances when shorta=
ges exist. This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp=
lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in=
 power bids. Dynegy's strategy of acquiring both natural-gas pipelines and =
power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities.=20
On the other side of this argument, a case could be made that Enron's appro=
ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility. Certainly,=
 by investing less in power generation facilities, Enron has less capital o=
n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy. Under a scenario when ma=
rket prices suddenly drop, a company such as Enron that does not have heavy=
 capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as=
set-laden company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe=
d payments of a generation facility. Asset-heavy companies also may find th=
at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit=
ies in times of extreme price volatility. As the industry becomes increasin=
gly focused on bottom-line results, this could be seen as a potential conce=
rn for investors. Further, some would argue that Enron's approach of establ=
ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r=
equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility. What E=
nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being=
 tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po=
rtfolio.=20
Consequently, the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the ""g=
reat debate"" among power traders. However, although Dynegy's overall perfor=
mance in the third quarter was better than Enron's, that does not necessari=
ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegy's strategy toward acquiring new ge=
neration facilities. Keep in mind that Enron's 3Q losses resulted primarily=
 from non-recurring charges related to its non-core businesses (broadband a=
nd water in particular). Without these charges, Enron's core wholesale trad=
ing business continues to perform well. This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha=
s been quick to reiterate to investors. ""Our 26-percent increase in recurri=
ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who=
lesale and retail energy businesses and our natural-gas pipelines,"" Lay sai=
d. ""The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leadi=
ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook.""=
=20
Moreover, perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets, the key issu=
e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn=
ings in the third quarter is the companies' approach to developing new line=
s of business.  Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point. Enron=
, which prides itself as usually gaining a first-strike advantage, plunged =
into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies. Under the lea=
dership of then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling, Enron sunk large sums of capital into=
 purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would qui=
ckly become lucrative. Now Lay admits that the company ""could have gotten i=
nto the broadband business with less capital"" and that Enron ""spent too muc=
h too soon"" in this sector. Nevertheless, Enron recorded an $80-million non=
-recurring write-down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third qua=
rter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by red=
ucing future costs in this sector to $40 million a quarter. =20
Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom=
 sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t=
o Enron. Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s=
ector, but in the third quarter took a $15-million loss in its broadband bu=
siness compared to the $80-million loss that Enron reported. However, Dyneg=
y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities (electricity=
 and natural gas) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa=
y that merely supplements its core business.=20
It is also important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage w=
hen it developed EnronOnline, an electronic trading exchange. In fact, Enro=
n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space, well ahead =
of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi=
rect. The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards, =
but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s=
uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its =
competitors. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha=
s recorded transactions that exceed $590 in notional value. Since its incep=
tion in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional tr=
ansactions. =20
At this juncture, Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their =
approaches toward financial reporting. Enron, which has often been accused =
of not providing a balance sheet to investors, is currently struggling from=
 a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues =
an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enron's CFO. To my rec=
ollection, no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet,=
 and thus the company's status with investors is arguably more solid. As I =
don't expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any=
 time soon, my projection is that (at least in the near term), we will cont=
inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and =
Enron. That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game. A=
s noted, the company's core business of wholesale business remains strong, =
but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non-core businesses. Th=
at doesn't mean Enron is down permanently, but it will have to find a way t=
o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos=
e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous.=
=20
In many ways, the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to=
rtoise and the hare parable. I am sure you can guess which company is the t=
ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy. The race between the two is =
far from over, although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point, based on i=
ts more methodical approach. What will be fascinating to observe is how bot=
h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo=
dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies. =20

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances that we should address, please reply to this e-mail and we will change our schedule accordingly.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

4022,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.",QNEC,,Enron Board of Directors Enron Corp. Savings Plan Plan QNEC Company Matching http://resources.hewitt.com/enron benefits.enron.com

4047,"Kenron's business is to create value and opportunity
for its senior management. We 
do this by combining our employees' personal financial
resources and restricting the 
flow of information to the market  to create
innovative accountancy solutions to 
challenge the US financial regulations. We are best
known for our lack of respect 
and truthfulness and single minded ambition to stray
from our core competencies of 
natural gas and electricity products into all kinds of
unprofitable markets and hair 
brained ventures. 

Today we offer vast diversified product range, 
including office space in many major 
US and European cities, second hand computer
equipment, and useless IT Helpdesk 
promotional gimmickry. In fact we have the largest
stock of nearly new Compaq and 
Sun computers in the world. These products give
customers the flexibility they need 
to lose all their money and achieve into the highly
sought after status of suing our ass 
in a class action. 

It's difficult to define Kenron in a sentence, but our
senior executives have been 
described as ""incompetent"", ""arrogant"" and "" a bunch
of thieving bustards"" by many 
top tier financial institutions. We falsify commodity
markets so that we can deliver 
physical commodities to our customers at a
ridiculously unsustainable price. It's 
difficult, too, to talk about Kenron without using the
word ""screwed."" Most of the things 
we do have never been done before, like going from a
market capitalisation of 
nearly $90 billion to $199 in the space of a year!!!!
We believe in the economic 
benefits of secret, underhanded insider trading, and
we play a leading role in ripping 
off our investors. We initiated the  wholesale
bandwidth markets in the United States, 
and we are helping to build similar markets in Europe
and elsewhere. Shame we 
lost billions in doing so :-( 

Every day we strive to hype up our share price to
unrealistic highs, with the sole 
purpose of suckering the investor community and lining
our own pockets. Our passion 
has enabled us to completely mismanage risk. No wonder
Misfortune Magazine 
surveys have named Kenron the most innovative company
in America for six years in 
a row. Our emloyees think Kenron is such a wonderful
place to work, thousands are 
leaving every day to spread the word around the world.


Knron's four business units -- Wholesale Services,
Energy Services, Broadband 
Services and Transportation Services -- ARE NOW
CLOSED.

I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the 
Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig 
Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day.  
However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate 
applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never 
be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada 
on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so 
that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't 
recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward 
the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.

conference call and meeting as follows:


1.  Conference call on Thursday 2/24 at 9:00 a.m. (their general manager will 
be involved)
2.  Depending on the conference call, Rochester will want us to come up for 
another face to face meeting on Tuesday, 2/29


Some of Rochester's key questions are as follows:

1.  Whats our PPA value?  I asked them to name it and they said they would 
want enough to cove their debt service...Also, they said they are fair and 
they are not greedy.

2.  Rochester wants to verify scope.  Are we offering turnkey?  I told them 
yes...they want to discuss details.  Where did we price the electric 
interconnect.  To the busbar or to inlet of step up transformer?

3.  Rochester has the ability to individually negotiate with us as long as we 
respond to their bid on time and provide a bid bond.  If we do not respond, 
then they have to get city council approval to negotiate directly.  
Basically, we need to complete some of the bid form to get us in the door.

4.  Bids are open on 3/10/00

ACTION ITEMS

1.  Russ, Ben, Oscar and Ozzie to participate in conference call on 2/24.

2.  Russ, Ben and Ozzie to go to Rochester if warranted.  ( I am unable to 
travel during that week)

3.  Determine if other Enron participants need to be involved (Mike Nanney, 
etc....Mike went on the first site visit with me)

4.  Respond to Rochester in bid format and look into getting a bid bond.

4.  Russ, Ben and Oscar work together to come up with a PPA value

5.  Verify whether we  want a second merchant unit at the site.

Responses to Cinergy's Gas Transport Questions

Brownsville
1)  Verify Type of Transportation Service and Identify location of 2 hour 
notice.
Transportation is provided  under  ITS Service Agreement Contract No. 10290 
.  This contract  is ANR's  pro forma ITS Agreement from its FERC Gas 
Tariff.  Changes to the pro forma  are included in the various rate letters 
(most recent dated September 20, 2000), the Operating Agreement (dated March 
31, 1999) and the Additional ANR Transportation Service letter (dated March 
30, 1999).  These three agreements were assigned to Brownsville Power I, LLC 
per the Assignment Agreement dated December 1, 1999.  

Specific to the question of the two hour notice, Brownsville's rights are 
identified in the Operating Agreement under Article 1 on page 2 of the 
agreement (See Articles 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03).  ANR's two hour notice rights 
are also identified under Article 1 (See 1.05).  Please note that ANR's two 
hour notice right is subject to the plant having taken delivery of gas 
volumes per Articles 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03.

2)  On ETS Conversion right, is ETS service seasonal or annual?
The seasonality of the conversion is not addressed under the Additional

Just to quickly address your questions in advance of our call in the
morning, I offer the following:

1.  The debt amount contemplated was based on assumptions given by Enron.
The rate given was $375 /kW or $120MM in debt.  This would be obtained via
a 144A Bond offering without any subdebt.

2.  There are three operating fees listed in the proforma currently:
Management fee ($600k/yr) to the Owners as contracted, O&M Fee ($300k/yr)
to the Operator contemplated to be TECO Power Services (""TPS"") and the TPS
Parts Company for a spare engine.  The TPS Spare engine may be eliminated
provided we can get comfort via other methods.  The financing fees were
estimates based on discussions with Enron and our engaging CSFB.

3.  The Maintenance Reserve account is accrued based on operating hours of
the plant and planned major maintenance, as estimated by TPS (the O&M
Operator).  This reserve may be eliminated as we currently are estimating
that this plant will never reach a major outage.

I look forward to discussing these issues with you in the morning.

",,,Scott
4150,"Don,

We got curves and spread option value from Structuring. Ben and I are 
finalising the first model based on following valuation method;

Valuation of Retail Short =
+ 1. Revenue from serving load (to get 12% IRR)
+  2. Expense from serving load at the market
+ 3. Spread option value for full capacity
+ 4. ICAP ($1.00/kw-mo for first 6 months)
- 5. Fixed expenses

Someone may think #2 (Expense from serving load at the market) is redundant, 
which maybe true, but I still think it is not double counting.

#1, 2, and 3 can be written as follows: (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + Max[(Pmkt - MC), 
0]*Capa, where Pees is Energy price charged to EES, Pmkt is Market price of 
power, Lees is EES load, MC is Marginal cost of peaker, and Capa is Capacity 
of peaker. Therefore,

If (Pmkt - MC) < 0, (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees,
If (Pmkt - MC) > 0, (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*Capa, 
   (Pees - Pmkt)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees),
   (Pees - Pmkt + Pmkt - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees),
   (Pees - MC)*Lees + (Pmkt - MC)*(Capa-Lees).  

This correctly shows our structure, I think. I will try to talk to you today 
after we finish model. Thank you.

for helping us out with this.  Attached is the team roster, and MS will bring 
the packets for the people on this list.  If you know of anyone else who 
should be on this list, let me know ASAP so we can get theirs included.

This is a street party, so come join the fun!

Some things you may be pondering:  

Yes, you can pick up rider packets for your friends if they cannot attend.  
MS Society will require a signed pledge sheet for any packet picked up, so be 
prepared for that if someone has asked your assistance with this.  For you 
rookies - if you've got a pledge sheet in production, just stop where you are 
and copy it to give to MS, and then you can continue with your pledge 
efforts.  If you haven't yet begun, you can fill out a blank one there, and 
sign your name obligating to the minimum pledge.  Money is not due yet - just 
pledges.

If you need to have your packet picked up, try to get a friend at Enron to do 
it who can deliver it to you, and if that's not an option, and you can get by 
the building at another time to pick up, just let us know and we'll reserve 
it for you if you fax your pledge sheet ahead of time - that means before 
10:00 AM on Friday.  This is the only private pickup we will have - after 
this, you'll need to go to one of the pickup points in the Rider Manual.  I 
will publish those for you later.

If you're picking up a jersey for a friend, we'll ask for a pledge commitment 
as well, because we like to know that everyone who rides for Enron pledges to 
raise a minimum of $400.  If any of you or your friends have trouble with 
this number, just contact me and we'll help you out.  We want you to ride 
with us, and I know it can be scary the first time you've tried to raise 
money.  Don't let that keep you off the team, just get in touch with me.

Jeff Nielsen of West U. Schwinn will be here to get your bikes inspected 
(free of charge).  If you don't know the reason for getting your bike 
inspected - it is designed to keep unworthy bikes off the road for safety and 
maintenance reasons, and if you have an official inspection sticker on your 
bike, you will not be charged any labor along the way if your bike should 
need repairs.  There is a bike shop at each rest stop to assist you with any 
breakdowns.

4155,"I am sending via fed ex a copy of the following info on Boston Gas/Colonial:

1. 11x17 map showing Tennessee routing through Colonial system
2. 8x14 map showing the various upgrades under discussion w/Boston Gas
3. recent information from Boston Gas on capacity/delivery pressure from BG.


Our understanding/expectation is that Tennessee will be increasing its line
pressure to accomadate potential back hauls now that Maritimes is tied in.  
The
expected pressure on TGP is expected to rise over 600 psi.  This will have a 
big
impact on deliverability.  Colonial serves ULP by drawing from Tennessee at
Tewksbury, and also has a LNG facility at that site.  In order to ensure that
LNG can always be injected into their system, BG needs to regulate pressure to
no more than 600psi at the city gate.  Currently the line is running from 
300psi
to 600psi throughout the year.

Can you confirm our assumptions?

We are looking at the various options, but clearly option 3 looks best.  We 
will
be sending follow up questions tomorrow on quality of service (pressure drop,
""firm"" service), throughput charges, and other clarifications.

We are asking BG for a meeting date next week, on either March 29 or 30; we
would like ENA to join us in these negotiations.  Let us know if these dates
work for you.

I am comfortable that the order setting the administrative claim bar date applies only to claims arising from the post-petition sale of power through the CAISO.  My understanding, based on an email from John, is that power sales under bilateral contracts, such as the EPMI power contract, do not go through the ISO.  Assuming that is correct (and if John or Elizabeth disagree, please let me know immediately), I am comfortable that there is no need to file an administrative claim for power sales under the EPMI contract for the period April 6 to April 9.

Similarly, the post-petition negative CTC claim does not arise from the sale of power through the ISO.  Thus, there is no need to file an administrative claim for it at this time.

4218,"Please see the attached spreadsheet for the estimated value to be received for delivering power in the East for the period 12/27 through 12/31 (we will be working on the post 12/31 periods this week).  In summary, the total is approx. is $2.7MM net.  The total cost of power is approx. $15.3MM.  It is broken down $4.5MM for PJM, $5.5MM for NEPOOL, and $5.3MM for Others (not including Ameren and Wabash) outside PJM and NEPOOL.  We are working separate arrangements for NEPOOL and PJM, having wired NEPOOL in excess of $8MM on Friday to prepay for power in an effort to be able to do business in that pool through 12/26.  We are working with PJM, and should have resolution by the 27th (they have $31MM of our pre-bankruptcy cash in escrow).  

Outside of PJM and NEPOOL, Kevin is going to go into the bilateral market and prepay for power (similar to what we are doing in the West).  As such, Kevin will need approximately $5.5MM  to prepay for power in the East through 12/31 (Ameren and Wabash are negative today through the 31st, but will turn positive after the first of the year - Kevin will not be serving these until after the first of the year).  The value outside of NEPOOL and PJM is a little over $700M.  Kevin has a number of customers that are in NEPOOL and /or PJM , as well as other regions and you need to serve in all regions to get the full value from the contract.

Having spoken with Tim DeSpain this morning, it appears Ray and Tim are on board for this course of action given that it is consistent with our mandate to preserve the value of the estate (and entering into these positions is ancillary to winding down the existing positions, and not some new speculative trade).

As such, Leslie and her team should expect to begin receiving the wiring instructions early Wednesday morning for Kevin's prepayment deals.

Kevin, I will work with you to explain the form of request that we have been using in the West.

RISKS:
HEDGING: As this juncture, our ability to hedge longer term is limited (requires significant cash - we need to do cost/benefit analysis).  We are therefore limited to daily spot transactions in PJM and NEPOOL.  Outside PJM and NEPOOL, Kevin may have limited ability to buy forward for a few days. We recognize this risk, and the next step in the analysis is to determine at what cost (prepay) can we hedge some of these contracts and if we can, should we. Regardless, it is generally believed that when we begin to serve some of these counterparties, they will terminate the contracts, which will crystallize the in-the-money-value of the contract.

OFFSET RIGHTS: We are still working through all the positions in Enron to determine which parties have master netting agreements that would allow someone to offset one position with another.  A quick review of the open East Power positions indicates this risk should be limited.  Additionally, we are still working through net payable/receivable issues and therefore we may owe some of these counterparties money which they may try to offset with the delivered power.  We are working through these issues, and again it is generally believed that the potential returns outweigh the risk, and that there is a high probability that some of these counterparties will terminate the contracts and crystallize the in-the-money-value to us.  

Please call me at 713-412-8967 (cell) or 713-529-6280 (home) if anyone has any questions.  Otherwise, Kevin and his team will begin to purchase power in the non PJM/NEPOOL markets on Wednesday, and will continue to serve the customers in PJM and NEPOOL, subject to resolving the open issues in those regions.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

Agreed that all parties would review the proposed framework with traders to try to ""fill in the boxes"". It was however recognised that there were difficulties in interpreting what was intended by the proposed RTO's and the relationship with the current Into Cinergy market.
	
AEP viewed that purchase of transmission was the critical area, who had to purchase what and several scenarios to work through. Whether Seller buys a wheel, whether buyer buys a wheel, or under MISO both parties buy a  wheel. This clearly has knock on effect for obligations in respect of firm and non-firm transmission and curtailment. In particular, what if non-firm is elected and how this flows through into obligations of the parties to a transaction.
	
Perception that the framework prepared by AEP will start all interested parties in the same place to talk about the issues. 
	
It was agreed to try to get a representative from Duke to join the next call as they were an Into Cinergy product trader as well.
	
The next call was scheduled for November 29th at 10 o clock Eastern time. It was suggested that everyone at least take first page of Mitch's schedule and talk to the traders, since this would probably the best starting point, Mitch encouraged any comments to be shared earlier if possible.

have to check our schedules once I get back into town.

",Jennifer Stringer,,
4234,"Dear Mike,

As various companies have expressed on several occasions, Enron, Reliant and 
Constellation strongly believe that the WSPP should provide some guidance to 
the membership as to the various issues that are unique but must be addressed 
when dealing with municipalities in the west (such as Public Utility 
Districts, Cities, etc...).  As was evident during the Las Vegas meeting, 
several members do not seem to have any experience in this regard and 
therefore should at the very least be apprised of the issues that might 
confront them when entering into transactions with such entities.

While we agree with you that an amendment might not be the appropriate 
mechanism at this time for addressing this issue, we think that it is 
imperative that the WSPP educate its membership as to the potential pitfalls 
involved.  Therefore, we propose that Wright and Talisman draft a memo that 
describes the authorizations that entities involved in trading other 
commodities commonly request (i.e. statutory authorizations to transact, 
signature authorizations, resolutions setting forth transaction parameters, 
board resolutions, city council approvals, etc.).  We would also request that 
W&T point to some relevant examples over the last few years - specifically, 
City of Springfield, Illinois and Orange County - as well as any other 
guidance that W&T might be able on the topic.  

Therefore, this issue is different than what Morgan Stanley proposed during 
the Las Vegas meeting. 

With regard to bringing up issues which have already been addressed, it is 
our understanding that the WSPP Working Group overwhelmingly voted not to 
incorporate East product definitions into the WSPP.   Therefore, we wonder 
why it appears in the agenda for SFO meeting.


Thank you, 

Shari Stack, Enron

Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.  Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity!

This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo.

The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community.

The millions of fans who attend Astros games each season will see the sign.  Be sure to look for this history-making sign hanging high above the outfield.",Elaine Brown,$6 million,Enron Enron Global Markets the United Way Astros Giants Enron Field United Way United Way's

Two quick things...

First- from volume management:
When scheduling a service customer such as Harbor or WheelabratorShasta, Arco, Tosco, etc. we need to be sure to schedule using the customer ID in CAPS.  Otherwise RT has no generation and we are considered short (please see myself or Kourtney with questions).


Second- from the preschedulers:
If we sit at Lisa or Stacy's desk, please be sure to log out of the computer and their phone.   Their computers are not necessarily for Real-Time use,  but I would like to be sure that we can continue to use these computers at night.  If they aren't happy with the cleanliness of their desk, or with having to reset their computers each morning, etc...we will probably lose this priviledge.

I am soooo sorry I am not able to watch them for you.  I feel bad because I
said I could.
I just didn't plan on all of this going on at the same time as your trip.
Yall are going to have
a blast!    The 10th is right around the corner.

I got a loan through Countrywide.  It is a good deal because I am going
with a no income/no asset loan.  Basically I don't disclose any of that
information.  I have to pay a higher rate because of it but it is the
easiest way for me to qualify.  Especially since the down payment is not
coming from my own funds.  But the rate isn't that bad because Countrywide
will pay a point for me since I have been here over a year.  It's just a
matter of finding the house I want.
I will let you know as soon as I get a signed contract.  Then you can come
to my house warming party!!  = )

The truck should be here anyday now.  I am very excited.  I feel like I
have waited forever!!  You remember when I first started talking about it
back in Dec of 2000.  That was a year and a half ago!!  Now I finally get
it.  Yipppppeeee!!!

The dogs are good.  I took Cookie and Tyson home for Mother's Day weekend.
Lucy and Tyson played like crazy!!
Mike fell in love with him.  He wants them both.  hee hee.  He is bringing
Lucy up to Dallas soon and I get to keep her for SIX MONTHS!!  That is
going to be insane.  (and alot of doodie too!!!)  But I know she will be
happy.  They all got along fine in San Antonio.  Oh, and Tyson LOVES
Cookie.  He licks her ears and eyes all the time.  And then she licks him
back.  It is really cute.

Conference attended by all in-state generators, a few munies, the IOUs and a 
few others. One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended 
for CA Large Consumers.  Nader sent someone.  No other consumers.  One other 
ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego).
Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the 
IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The 
prices are quite divergent.  He expresses concern at the little offered.
Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible 
on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers).
IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., 
BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so.
Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now.
Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part 
existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with 
the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate 
increase.
Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough
Enron able to take low profile.
SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing 
could be achieved.
Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed 
epithets at SDG&E and SCE.  SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning.  

Out of the Room

Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators.
Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs.
Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC 
involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable 
resolution.

Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks

Judge asked everyone to consider how to ""Share the Pain"" for Thursday's 
meeting and said not to expect any ""win:win"" scenario. His view is that FERC 
is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court.
His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 
12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its 
supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward 
contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates.  Generators oppose 
this, I believe.

4298,"Here is the memo that I prepared and gave to Mark earlier today.
",Mark,,
4299,"The committee had a lengthy conference call today.  Let me touch on key
topics.  First, the application to employ PriceWaterhouse is being
contested by both the debtor and the US trustee.  There was a meeting today
with the debtor to narrow differences.  The debtor will provide a list of
its key concerns and we'll see if we can deal with them.  The UST just
believes that there is too much of a chance of conflict between roles in
the two cases.  We'll be setting a hearing soon to get the issue resolved
on way or the other.  Second, PGE has sought broad discovery from PX not
only of individual participants' claims against PGE but also underlying
trading information.  PX contends that much of this information cannot be
disclosed under the tariffs.  For that reason, PX hasn't even kprovided
this information to its participants.  Eisenberg is opposing the discovery
for that reason as well as based on burden to the debtor.  The PX committee
feels that Montali will accomodate discovery, at least to some extent.
Therefore, in the meet and confer this afternoon, the committee probably
will support disclosure if (1) participants get whatever of their
information as is disclosed to PGE, (2) substantial limitations are imposed
on the parties that will have access to the information and the use to
which it can be put and (3) PGE reimburses PX for a part of the cost.  In
addition, the committee intends to file a motion in the PX case requesting
that the debtor be ordered to turn information over to individual
participants and to our accountants who will have the responsibility to
test numbers but not to make general disclosure of accounts of individual
participants.  Third, Howard Weg believes that without some agreement on
the chargeback issue, FERC will take a long time to rule on whether PX
should return collateral.  Accordingly, Weg wants the participants to come
to an agreement that for any specified period, shortfalls will be shared
prorata among participants.  I asked Weg to send an email out to committee
members describing in detail his proposal and the basis for it so that we
could discuss it in detail during our next call.  Fourth, the commandeering
matters are proceeding.  The committee will complete interviews of
prospective counsel next Monday.  In the meantime, the Victims Compensation
Claims Board should rule June 22.  A summary denial is expected.
Interestingly, only about 30% of the participants submitted claims to the
board.  PX's expert opinion was made available to the committee.  He fixes
the value of commandeered contracts at $1.060 billion minus $350 million of
contract prices for a loss of just under $700 million.  We are following up
to test these numbers.  The committee's counsel has been negotiating a
stipulation for relief from stay in the PGE case.  It's moving too slowly,
so our counsel is drafting a stay relief motion for our review.  No one
seems inclined to start a commandeering suit until relief is granted.
Fifth, our counsel is having second thoughts about a stipulation with
Edison that would address the bond, the force majeur litigation and related
matters.  The question that is under review is whether the proposed deal
could be unwound if SCE files its own cha;pter 11 case.  On force majeur,
Judge Montali apparently rejected PGE's argument on that point.  Sixth,
there is still no deal with the trade creditors' committee.  They want
about double the $4 million we're offering.  We expect any day a motion to
extend plan exclusivity by the debtor.  Seventh, we discussed some
committee representation issues.  The committee voted against adding Puget
Sound as a member.  The committee agreed that it represented those who had
claims based on the scheduling coordinator role performed by PX for ISO.
The committee discussed whether it represented IOU's and concluded that it
did if they were owed in their role as sellers to the PX.  Finally, the
next meeting was set at 10 pst on June 25.  Feel free to call if there are
questions.  Bob Nelson","kprovided

participants indicating that Enron has broken the PX's rules by purposefully

The attached FERC complaint opposing PX action is probably not in final form 
yet, but I wanted to get you in the loop because it may be filed with FERC as 
soon as tomorrow.   The complaint explains that the PX tariff contains no 
prohibition against overscheduling and the California Independent System 
Operator, not the PX, schedules congestion over interties.  Further, under 
FERC precedent, without prior FERC review, the Cal PX should not be issuing 
letters finding violations.  Finally, the PX's analysis is seriously flawed 
because it doesn't consider market rules that actually caused the congestion 
and any potentially related price increase.  

We are very concerned about the PX's actions because we believe California 
utilities may be awaiting this letter to sue EPMI  (estimated claims ranging 
between $6 million and $47 million).  We probably want to aggressively 
publicise the filing so our side of the story comes out instead of the PX's.

4334,"Steve Smith called this afternoon.  He was anxious to know where we stood on
the issue of the third arbitrator.

He advised me that they have withdrawn Bill Paul as a proposed arbitrator.

I disclosed Judge Webster's relationship with me and my wife, and his firm's
relationship with Enron, whereupon Smith advised that they would not be
willing to have him as the neutral.

He asked me where we stood re Morris, Roberts and Sessions.  ""Sessions?""
said I.  Apparently they considered putting former judge Bill Sessions on
their list but must have decided not to do so.  (the third proposal was
Layne Phillips)

I told him that we were considering them, that Beatty was going to call
Renfrew to get more info about his relationships with them, and that we
probably were going to propose some names of our own next week.

Smith advised me that the deadline for selecting the neutral was January 15
(Monday), and that they did not intend to let the schedule slip.  I told him
that we were aware of the deadline, but as a practical matter did not see
what significance it really had since going to AAA (the remedy in the letter
agreement) would only slow the process down, not speed it up.  It reiterated
about five times that they expected us to stick to the deadline and did not
want the schedule for the arbitration to slip (has this man been speaking to
Brian Redmond secretly?).

I told Smith five times that we were not going to send them names this week,
and were unlikely to agree to one of theirs this week.  I told him that if
he insisted on an answer re his remaining three prior to Monday, that would
be easy:  the answer would be no.  I told him I preferred to take the time
to actually consider whether one of them was acceptable, and assumed that's
what he would want once he thought about it.

We should try to get back to him sometime next week with a response re his
remaining three and, unless we are agreeing to one of those, some proposals
of our own.

   He is working on clearing conflicts.
   Various offices of Baker have been contacted  for
purposes of this case by:
    NRG, Reliant, Williams, Duke
 David Noonan & Michael Kirby
  Available but not scheduled.  He is working on clearing the
Southern California Edison potential    conflict.
 Michael Weaver
   Will not have conflict results done until Mondayh.
PGE, SDGE and others.  He is still in New York is part of the problem.  He
is available to meet if conflicts clear.  He understands that he needs to
get this done ASAP.
 Dan Lamb
  Available.

 No action taken to date.
Experts
 Charles River
   Called Gordon Rausser and gave him Richard's contact
information in Houston and suggested he try to meet after meeting with Ken

  NERA
   Called again.  Expect to hear back at 3:00 p.m.
today.
Preemption
 Enron's FERC filing today will directly address preemption unless it
is changed immediately.
Removal
 We believe that SEMPRA is a California Corporation with its
principle place of business in San Diego.   Source:  California
Secretary of State On Line Records- Lexis.  If SEMPRA has been served, there
may  be no way to remove based upon diversity unless we can show a sham
(unlikely here.)  If SEMPRA is not  served yet and the other served
defendants agree, maybe we could get removal.  If SEMPRA is later
served, factor in remand.
Election of Judges:
 We are still determining election cycle for Judge Meyer and Judge
Amos.
 According to one counsel that we interviewed, he believes that Judge
Meyer is a ""dim bulb on the  chandelier"" and Judge Amos is worse.

good idea to remain in contact with Eric Tan.  I do not think we need to have
anything as formal as a consulting agreement.  It is just important that one
person makes sure that we know where Eric Tan is at all times in the event 
that
we need to contact him.

4352,"PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT AND OTHER PRIVILEGES

Mark:

I assume that you and Richard are very familiar with the day-to-day 
developments in the heavily publicized FERC case involving the investigation 
by FERC of El Paso's sale of pipeline capacity into the CA market to its 
merchant arm last year that CA officials have partly blamed for the spike in 
gas and power prices.  As you know, this is the case where the highest 
executives of El Paso recently were called to testify at FERC.

An article in this morning's New York Times (which begins on page 1), in 
discussing El Paso's significant earnings generated by the El Paso merchant 
arm from the pipeline capacity purchase, says that the parties with which El 
Paso hedged its position also made sizeable profits.  The article notes that 
about half of El Paso's trades were with Enron ""according to people present 
at the briefings El Paso officials have given to California officials.""  
While this probably is not surprising in light of our size and breadth in the 
market, it nonetheless is made to sound somewhat sinister, and my sense is 
that it is just another potential barb for the CA officials to throw at us.  
Since the article quotes a response from Mark Palmer (in which he suggests 
that Enron, in turn, likely would have resold the capacity and would not have 
realized the benefit of the rising market), I assumed that you were aware of 
it, but I thought I would err on the side of putting an extra e-mail in your 
in-box.

Kathy continued with day 2 of Nolan's deposition.? She will conclude tomorrow 
and will be followed by M. Swartz and Corey Gorden from Robins, Kaplan.? Tom 
Hatch is apparently preparing for Aron Izower's (White & Case) deposition on 
Friday in New York.? Some of the defense counsel (in particular Michael 
Tomaino) have taken the position that if Nolan is still being deposed on 
Friday, they want Izower's deposition rescheduled.? Plaintiffs' counsel are 
holding firm but agreed to revisit the issue as we get closer to Friday.

Highlights of day 2: 

-- Nolan spent the bulk of the day discussing the numerous problems with the 
quality of the steel being produced during the time he visited the plant 
(April-June '98 timeframe).? Quality problems included oxidation, 
carbonization, edge cracks from too much copper, and coil breaks from too 
much heat.

--Nolan continued his description of the plant's engineering and mechanical 
problems 

--Nolan indicated that he was aware that NSM spent approx. $50 million to 
purchase scrap metal that was very poor quality (Nolan blamed the 
incompetence of NSM's manager Wolfgang Lentz)

--There wasn't much mention of Barth or McConville today.

4360,"I wanted to give you an update as to the status of the NSM Cases:

1)  Farallon:  There is a signed settlement agreement in place.  (I have th=
e
plaintiffs' signature pages and am gathering the other defendants' and will
forward you a fully-executed copy when I've got it.)  However, the case has
not been dismissed yet because of two small issues, neither of which involv=
es
Enron/ECT Securities directly.  First, plaintiffs had wanted two signatures=
 from each defendant on the
Settlement Agreement.  (The California corporations code provides that a
corporation cannot claim lack of authority by signers of a document if both
the president or a vice president and the secretary, CFO or treasurer sign.=
) I've convinced them to accept one signature from ECT Securities because i=
t is
a limited partnership, so the code provision does not apply.  However, the
plaintiffs are insisting that Natwest, several of whose entities are
corporations, provide two signatures instead of only one.  I suspect the is=
sue
will be worked out this week - there is a hearing scheduled for Friday (7/2=
0)
at which the case is expected to be dismissed.

Second, several of the defendants (but not ECT Securities) have cross-claim=
s
against John Schultes that were not released in the settlement with
plaintiffs.  In negotiating to settle those claims, Schultes indicated that=
 he
wanted to be released from liability by all defendants, including ECT
Securities.  However, we have made clear to the other parties that ECT
Securities (and its affiliates) will not release any claims it may have
against Schultes (e.g., for indemnification and/or contribution with respec=
t
to our settlement amount and attorneys fees) without being released from al=
l
liability to Schultes relating to NSM - including the action he filed in Oh=
io
state court, in which he sued Enron.  The other defendants may settle with
Schultes and simply leave ECT out of it, in which case the entire Farallon
case could be dismissed, leaving Enron/ECT to deal with Schultes on our own=
. (ECT has the right to bring any indemnification or contribution claims in=
 a
separate action, so dismissal of the case would not affect its rights.)  I'=
ll
keep you updated on this - we should know more by the hearing on Friday
morning.

2)  Legg Mason.  We have a fully-executed settlement agreement.  (I'll send
you a copy later today.)  Plaintiffs expect to dismiss the case later this
week - perhaps at the hearing on Friday in Farallon.  I'll keep you updated=
.

3)  Agreement among defendants.  All defendants have signed the agreement a=
nd
releases.  I will have all signature pages today and send you a copy.

was mentioned probably three or four times in three days (and then only in 
questions, not in answers).

Kathy's themes were: 

??????? 1.? At the time of the offering, portions of the hot mill were 
incomplete, and the hot mill was not really operating.

??????? 2.? The design of the cold mill was flawed. 

??????? 3.? The role of SDI in the managment of NSM was greatly exaggerated 
in the offering presentations.? [Kathy did not seem to be be saying (as other 
have) that the role of the Management Co. was exaggerated.]

??????? 4.? Nucor was really Stickler's first choice for SDI's role, but 
Nucor pulled out becasue of substantive concerns, e.g., flawed design of cold 
mill.? Stickler lied when he told others that Nucor just wanted too much 
money.? (Based on what I have seen so far, I don't think we know yet why 
Stickler and Nucor did not make a deal.)

??????? 5.? By late April 1998, if not before, NSM managment and directors 
knew that the projections in the offering materials were way off, as NSM's 
own internal budget was much different.? (Roland and I showed you these 
documents when we were last in Houston.)? A substantial portion of the 
offering funds were still in trust at this time (how much???), and the 
bondholders should have been told (when they could still pull back some of 
their money if they wanted to) that the projections on which they had 
invesfted were not correct.? [If this argument were developed and had legal 
merit, it could hurt Enron, as its affiliates or employees were (a) ""initial 
purchasers"" in the offering, (b) a member of the management co., and (c) a 
member of the NSM board.]

??????? Kathy was never clear in her questioning whether she regarded SDI as 
a defrauder or a defraudee.? At times she seemed to be saying that SDI knew 
bad things about NSM and the mill and concealed them or permitted others to 
lie about them.? At other times she seemed to be inviting Busse to say that 
he was lied to.

??????? There is no question that Kathy regards David Stickler as the number 
one bad guy and David Wheeler (NatWest) as number two.

??????? Busse's principal themes were:? (1) SDI agreed only to a very limited 
role; (2) all of the problems were soluble IF NSM had good management.? NSM 
turned out to have terrible managment.? Busse and everyone else were lied to 
about that, and that is why NSM failed.

??????? I had not realized before this week that, by the time of the closing, 
the Management Co. had only 3 members (SDI and affiliates of McDonald and 
Enron.)? [Stickler was appointed manager of the Management Co.]? If Enron has 
a problem in this case, it will likely arise out of the combination of 
enron's two roles--i.e., involved in the offering itself and then in the 
follow on management of NSM.

??????? I suggest that, if I can't make progress with Hirschmann next week,? 
we (Milbank) notice and take Legg-Mason's deposition (assuming that the other 
defendants agree--and maybe even if they don't.)? It's time to stop letting 
Legg Mason have a free ride.

4362,"All parties have agreed to extend discovery cut off from 1/19 to 3/5/01, but
only for depositions of scheduled persons.  The ""protected"" list includes
Brian Barth, the person most knowledgable from ECT Securities, Julien Smythe,
and the person most knowledgable from Akin, Gump.  The list does not include
Kevin McConville.  I assume that ECT will designate Barth as PMK and that Akin
Gump will designate Smythe as PMK, so that we are talking about only two
depositions.

Trial dates and dispositive motion deadlines have not changed.

As a result of the the limited extension of discovery cutoff, plaintiffs want
to push Brian back to the week of January 29th or the week of February 5th. 
They are also making noise about Brian's deposition possibly taking four days.
 We may want to take the position that Brian will be there for three days and
no more.  That will ruffle a lot of feathers, and you and I should discuss it.

Hennegan has asked if I will represent Akin Gump and, if so, will I accept
service.  You and I should discuss this also.  Either way, we need to alert
Akin Gump what is going on.

summarize the status of EES's planned response to the AG's subpoenas. As
these things go it is not grossly inaccurate. I suggest we send a clarifying
response that makes the following points:

	. All discussions with the AG, and any interim production of
documents, are made without prejudice to our rights to stand on any and all
objections to the subpoena if the AG files an enforcement action.
	. We have more objections to their proposed protective order than
are reflected in their letter. However, we will modify their proposed
protective order and send them an order acceptable to govern the production
of certain in-state EES documents in the next few days.
	.We are in the process of providing notice to all commercial
accounts (without regard for any other definition) that their contracts have
been requested and may be produced to the AG. Whether our duty, if any, to
resist production under the terms of some of these contacts has been
discharged is unclear and we don't agree that it has been discharged.
	. Without waiving any of our objections to either the investigation
or the subpoena, we will voluntarily produce documents which reside within
California which are clearly and unambiguously called for by the subpoena ,
on the condition that we reach an acceptable confidentiality order to govern
their production. We are ready to begin doing so on or about July 30.

	I suggest we send this letter before the close of business today.
Please let me know if you think we should modify this position, or add to
it.

4371,"This briefly reports on the status of the production of in-state Enron
documents to the depository in Sacramento:

. Approximately 30,000 documents are now in the Sacramento depository. All
are bate stamped. These documents are primarily ISO related documents and
appear not to raise serious confidentiality concerns. We notified ISO we
were going to produce these documents and they were reviewed for privilege
by  outside counsel for ISO. She requested we withhold certain documents for
privilege and we did so at her request. We will mark these on a privilege
log and direct Dunn to ISO counsel if he wishes to contest the claim of
privilege.  Dunne's representatives have not reviewed any of the documents
in Sacramento to date.  We propose to staff the depository upon  reasonable
notice from the Committee that they wish to review documents. We should send
them a letter that says we require such notice.
.There are approximately another 20,000 documents at our firm that are
potentially responsive to the subpoena. Many of these documents do appear to
raised confidentiality issues. We have sent examples of these documents to
many of you and await your comments before we ready them for production. We
will not produce them in Sacramento without further discussion on the issue.
Included in these 20,000 documents are documents from the IEP trade
association. We need to speak to the attorney's representing the IEP before
production.
.We have not completed a privilege review of unproduced hard copy documents
in San Francisco, nor completed a privilege log, pending further discussion
on this issue with Mike Kirby.
. We believe we have identified most potentially responsive hard copy
documents in Enron's San Francisco office. However, we have  reviewed very
few electronic documents, including e-mail. We propose to do so next week
for the following individuals only: Dave Parquet, Sue Mara, and Mike
McDonald. We will need clearance from Richard to enable us to do so

It looks like the complaint filed by Morgan Stanley this past July, similar to the complaint we worked on regarding the ISO's TTC/ATC values and phantom congestion, is being attended to by FERC.  The Order attached to this message institiutes an investigation into the matter, orders the ISO to investigate intermediary actions which could be implemented to deal with phantom congestion in light of a total market redesign and orders an evidentiary hearing with an ALJ.

""The hearing should determine whether there are reasonable interim solutions available that would remedy this problem of ""phantom congestion"" for transmission users of the ISO grid absent a total market redesign.  We recognize that ultimately the regional market in the West must be operated under standard scheduling procedures that will apply to all market participants.""

While the Morgan Stanley complaint did not address all of the issues ours did, it looks like they will be addressing the main issue, which essentially amounts to witholding of ATC.

Do we want to, or can we, participate in the hearing?

A list of OBA concerns for possible tariff revisions are as follows:

	1.  A mechanism to assure Operators remain within an acceptable tolerance (5%) on a daily basis, or receive a penalty.

	2.  A mechanism to require specific reconciliation periods ( Quarterly).

	3.  A mechanism to require specific periods to allow a final contract disposition to a ""0""  balance, upon reconciliation.

The above suggestions would reduce the misuse of the OBA contacts.

Mom said you weren't feeling so great all week because of your sinus
problems and a sore throat.  NO FUN!!  Hope you're better now.  If you are
at work today, you are probably swamped with things to catch up on.

You make it pretty hard to give you a thank-you.  I write you an e-mail
thanking you for great stuff you've done, and you come back with more stuff
to give us.  :)

Coming to Houston for the 4th of July sounds good to us.  WE APPRECIATE THE
OFFER TO PAY FOR AIRFARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We had been thinking of
renting a van to drive the whole way.

The tricky thing again this year is figuring out how to get Ben there.  He
has another church event the week of June 25th-July 2nd.  We thought about
having him ride back on the bus to Omaha (so he doesn't miss out on the fun
stuff they do on the way back), arriving Monday the 2nd around noon, and
then we all fly out together on the afternoon of the 2nd or... Mark Anna and
I leave on Friday or Saturday the 28th or 29th, and have Marlyss and Gary
help Ben catch a flight Monday the 2nd or Tuesday the 3rd.  Mark should be
able to take the whole week off.

The other tricky thing in the whole deal has to do with whether Ben will
have to take summer school.  He has been told that if he flunks a class this
semester, he will have to retake it in summer school.  We won't know for
sure if he is going to flunk until the middle or end of May.  If he has to
take summer school, he will not go on the church event or come to Houston
with us because summer school is only offered the first part of June through
July 13th.  If reservations are made for Ben, we would not be able to use
it.  Let me know your thoughts.

I did look up information again about the educational IRA.  According to
page 27 of the 1040 instruction book, you cannot deduct contributions to an
educational IRA (just like you cannot deduct contributions to a Roth).

Mark and I haven't decided anything about the NE fund.

You probably realize this but the kids educational IRA's are not doing well.
Your $1,000 contribution is now down to $843.  I know you say for the long
run we shouldn't worry, but since Ben will graduate in 3 years, I'm
wondering if it is still the best place to be.  Let me know what you think.

Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.  The next 
earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's no way 
I could make that one because of  work.  The other option is to fly in 
Saturday morning like I did last time.  I'm leaning towards leaving Friday 
night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up 
to let me in.  That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things and I 
wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave around 
6:00).  Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the various 
options?  Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.

agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take 
the following steps:

1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 
of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) 
provides that either party may terminate the OBA ""at the end of the primary 
term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice"" to 
Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since 
gone month-to-month.)

2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect 
agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 
Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either 
party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary 
term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire 
until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement ""may 
be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
the event the OBA between the parties is terminated.""

our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions.",,,Burlington OBA Interconnect Point Operating Agreement

4505,"Hi yourself,

Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the 
impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it 
must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.

Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to 
Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and 
then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and 
then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there 
so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name, 
walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting 
down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they 
had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up 
going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we 
parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell 
phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us 
Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it 
was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him 
one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday 
gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know 
each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the 
best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be 
sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels 
pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run 
through the stats:

Height :   6'2"" - 6'3""
Weight : about 225 lbs.
Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where)
Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it 
may be more of an issue for him than me.
Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA

ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family.
  Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion)
  His dad was in the Navy
  Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of 
humor and likes to laugh
  He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in 
the hill country

Best Quotes:    ""Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in 
jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots."" 
  ""Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has 
an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great    
businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and 
three of them are married.""
  ""Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker 
than any group of women I've ever met.""
  ""I really want to learn how to two step.""
  
So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive 
characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every 
capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you 
informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment, 
the job hunt and everything else is going.

With respect to Glen Sullivan's concerns about discussing  the?rate impacts 
on EGs, I have the following comments.? Certainly, it  is difficult at this 
point to project how much backbone capacity will be  subscribed, and at what 
cost.? However, it is a fact that every end user on  the SoCalGas system will 
need to acquire and pay for backbone capacity in order  to move gas to their 
facility.? Lad and Gillian made, in my view, a  reasonable estimate that, on 
average, end users would pay $0.07 per Dth for  backbone service, based on 
total backbone costs divided by BCAP  throughput.? Some may use interruptible 
service and pay 120% of this rate;  others may obtain backbone service at a 
discount.? On average, Lad and  Gillian's numbers are a reasonable projection 
and very defensible.?  Moreover, in my view, we need to try to seize the high 
ground on the issue of  rate impacts on EGs; otherwise SCGC?will do so, 
and?our settlement  could face a real problem.

4527,"Hey gang,
I've taken the first stab at answering Norm's inquiry... give me your 
thoughts.  Also, Susan, what is the protocol for a case being litigated at 
the CPUC for inquiries like this?  Should we put a disclaimer that the 
information we might provide is protected under Rule 51 or other ""settlement 
discussions only"" protection?



Mr. Pedersen,
First, I'd like to clear-up the nomenclature being used here.  As you know, 
currently SoCalGas doesn't assign ""primary rights"" to deliveries off of any 
interconnecting pipeline.  The establishment of tradeable rights for 
intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the 
CPUC proceeding.   However, if what you are asking about is what has been the 
historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for Transwestern 
deliveries at North Needles, then let me offer the following. 

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could 
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt 
point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its 
interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed 
the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.  
The 340 MMcf/d difference between the mainline capacity and the physical 
capacity into SoCalGas at North Needles is used to provide firm service at 
our other delivery points at or near the California border, including PG&E, 
Mojave, Southwest Gas, Citizens Utilities, and in the near future, directly 
connected electric generation plants.

4532,"I think the example of when quantities may be subject to transportation and 
fuel is when an Operator overpulls at a delivery point and then cashes out 
the imbalance, TW could be out the transport and fuel.  For example,  

  DP is SoCal/Needles: scheduled volume is 700,000/d
     actual volume delivered is 720,000/d
     imbalance is 20,000/d, SoCal owes TW
     TW collects transport & fuel on 700,000/d (bill on scheduled volume)
     SoCal cuts a check to TW for dollar value of 20,000/d
     TW doesn't collect transport & fuel on 20,000/d
  Payback in-kind doesn't have this problem:
     The 20,000/d transport gets scheduled at Needles, TW collects the 
transport & fuel      (bill on scheduled volume), but we physically give 
SoCal 20,000/d less on that day

Is this the correct example?  I'm copying Lynn Blair to verify.

4535,"While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of 
these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now 
more appropriate than ever.

One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when 
they trust.  Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's 
level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause 
irreparable harm.  If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is 
violated it colours every aspect of your life.  There are too many people in 
this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born 
that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times 
that trust was thrown back in their face.  I don't mean to suggest from the 
above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather 
that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses.  
I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing 
and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a 
great deal more about them and their character.  The smallest acts and 
statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant. (This includes 
listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of 
people whom you respect.)

To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically 
reminded what fragile creatures we humans are.  That beyond the hype and 
self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, 
cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always 
be a part of us.  I think that only by recognizing those components and 
trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger.",,,
4536,"Thursday night was indeed a blast.  I think my cohorts were ruing my 
existence by the end of the evening because I didn't have to go to work 
Friday (wedding in Dallas...very fun).  I'm sure you managed to have an all 
right time in SF as well.  I am definitely up for a bucket of beer this 
week.  It's supposed to be sunny and warm all week long and I can think of 
nothing that goes better with that than cold beer.  As for Austin, I have a 
wealth of information on the subject that I would be more than happy to 
share.

As for the pick up, the Sissy Crawford taxi is at your service.  Just name

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.",,,Enron Corp. Savings Plan Savings Plan Hewitt and Northern Trust Enron

Since every Saj is equal parts idealist and gambler, your relationship should 
be very interesting. 
You're great pals, marvelous traveling companions, a pair of high-flying, 
high-rolling 
activist/adventurers. Just come down to earth once in awhile -- or find 
someone else to 
do it for you. This union requires periodic reality checks. You share each 
others ideals, interests 
and adventures like no one else can. Both of you like to read, study, 
observe, learn and teach. 
When you're doing all those things together, life may get exhausting but 
never boring. 
Travel is part of the glue that holds you together. So here's a warning: 
Separate vacations 
are a no-no. Each of you is such a wanderer, somebody might not come back -- 
or remain at home.

We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.  I'm in 
need of a good chat.

Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about 
to pull your hair out.  Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon and 
you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).  Please 
tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls exams.

Lisa - Hey sweetie!  I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA, 
but Jen said it went really well.  We need to get together soon I've missed 
seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings 
ons in your life.  Tell Brad I say ""Hi"" and I'll be glued to the TV set just 
like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.

Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and the 
""Fam"".  Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially your 
Mom) is absolutely in love with him.  Keep me posted on your plans for the 
future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).  Also, I 
thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to work in 
your old hometown - Chicago.  Any thoughts?

Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at 
myself for letting that happen.  Please write back soon and let me know how 
school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not completely 
out of touch) are all doing.  My guess is you're going through exams as well

old enough to know who they are and what they want.  Some critical things

ability to send you soaring or plummet you to the darkest depths.

I know I must resort to my new tag line that guys in general are just 
confused.  I must say though that his quote was outstanding and if Ben and I

4686,"Hello Team, 

Now that we have sent for execution or executed close to 50 new agreements 
and we have to refer back to these agreements and documents, it is all the 
more important that we make sure that the administrative tasks we previously  
discussed are in fact accomplished.    I suggest that we schedule a meeting 
to make sure 

(1) that, as per our previous discussions, Stephanie or whichever legal 
assistant working on brokerage agreements are tracking the agreements sent 
out and creating the brokerage agreement files once the Agreements are 
executed.   Also, we want to make sure everyone knows where to go when you 
need certain documents/where these files are located and what is supposed to 
be in them.  (I think they were just moved from Samantha's desk to 
Stephanie's desk, right?)

(2) I recommend that once we get the executed documents, we need a legal 
assistant to record the account numbers and execution dates in lotus notes 
when she receives the documents.

(3) Also, I want to make sure that we are keeping a file on Authorized Trader 
announcements and changes.  I want to resuugest that the legal assistant also 
needs to send some type of form letter to the pre-existing firms to give 
notice when the list of authorized traders changes - this is critical, 
especially now that there are so many accounts and so many changes.  Maybe we 
can draft a form letter and have a template or something.  We should also 
create a list of contact persons to whom such a list has to go to.

(4) Also, now that we have more another legal assistant, we should meet to 
discuss how the assistant can ""take back"" some of the tasks I had taken on to 
make life easier without such help - getting signatures, preapring the 
documents, calling the counterparty etc.  This will free-up some much needed 
time to review ISDA's, Confirms etc.

(5) Which legal assistants will work on what?

Sara may have additional topics, this is just some of immediate concern.

My part will be to document the ECT to Enron Europe Limited transactions

As for the trade ticket, please modify as follows:

Add ""Limited"" to the CP name.

would like to be ready to send out our paper if we are selected as the

and NEP could pick either one.  We've prepared a physical contract and wanted 
to alert you that there may be a need for a financial one -- which I assume 
would be in the form of an ""Omnibus"" agreement (as far as I can tell, we do 
not have an ISDA in place w/ NEP).  John will let us know tomorrow either

4724,"Dear Shareholder:

As a follow up to today's email to stockholders, I want to provide you with
the underlying assumptions used to produce the annual rates of return
contained in the graph.
The annual rate of return is calculated by comparing the (i) annual
appreciation of a seat and (ii) the lease revenue (based upon the cumulative
monthly average for a 6-month lease) generated for a calendar year with
(iii) the purchase price at the beginning of a calendar year. For instance,
if you bought a seat at the last seat price in 1999 ($690,000) and leased it
at the average lease rate over the course of a year, the amount of revenue
you would receive, taking annual appreciation into account, would provide a
20% annual rate of return as of the last day of 2000.

Sincerely,

We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

4740,"Hi Sara, 

(1) For clarification, my voicemail was not full on Friday - I checked it, got several messages including one fromTom Doukas and called him and others immediately as I arrived.  My voicemail was full on Monday - when I checked in with Keegan on Monday late morningshe advised me of such and I deleted the calls periodically.  I do realize that I do get a lot of calls and emails due to the 50 or so  brokerage related agreements & the numerous deals I am working on so I do try to clear the box daily.

(2) I can be of more assistance in the future if, instead of telling Keegan you need a file, that you contact me directly. That way, I can make sure that you get what you need.   I took a lot of Enron calls and faxes while on vacation so I would not have objected had you contacted me directly.  That way we do not have to put the burden on Keegan to locate my files -- although I am sure she is more than willing to help, I do not think she knows much about where I keep particular files or documents.  

(3) Also with respect to Keegan, I wanted to relay to you that she felt uncomfortable being quizzed by you or  passing judgment as to why I have chosen to receive orthodontal treatment in New York rather than in Houston.  (The answer to the question is irrelevant.  If I were getting treatment across the street from the office, I still could be here to do any work.  My getting the treatment in New York, while I am on vacation, does not affect my presence in the office or undermine in any way my ability to do my job).  

Equally important,  apparently these were not fair questions of Keegan, as she has informed me that they made her feel uncomfortable and she only answered because she sensed or thought she was obligated to do so.  Nor do I think they are fair of me.  I do not wish to justify my medical decisions with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or sick time I rightfully  can take.  It was previously represented to me that our department policy is that when out for medical reasons, we should provide in an email or otherwise convey a general statement - the details are not required.  If that is not the policy then please advise.  In any case, if for some justifiable reason you have to know such information and you need to rely on it, it is best to ask me directly so that you can be sure that the information you are getting is accurate.

I have reviewed this briefly and have a couple of issues/comments.
I am concerned about the references to cash accounts.  I need to discuss
with the group.  ENA is not authorized to operate cash accounts.
Overdrafts and advances should not be permitted (sections 2Ciii and 4A)
I need to discuss FX with Laurel.  Again, ENA should not be operating cash
accounts.
Any verbal or fax instruction must be confirmed with callback or other
security procedures.  We have some sample call back procedures, test keys
are mentioned but are messy.  Need to discuss.  3C-authority to act should
be predicated on following the agreed procedures.  Maybe this is implied.
In 2, it is mentioned that info can be given.  I think it should be only if
required by law.
5A, generally, we don't allow fees to be debited.
5C I agree with you 5C is ugly.  I think this must be limited to the assets
in the specific accounts related to the agreement.

I am currently working on hypothecation of securities specifically  focusing 
on the Mahonia structure. We would also like to realise the benefit of being 
able to rehypothecate securities that we receive under other transactions (at 
the last count in the region of $60mm).

I am working with Clement to ensure that we can get the Chase Domestic 
Custody Agreement executed ASAP, & also working with Sara & Teresa to ensure 
that  the Chase ISDA & Mahonia docs reflect our ability to rehypothecate 
securities. 

Additionally I have been having discussions and assistance from Wendi & Molly:
To get CRM sign-off for Sara & Teresa so they can proceed with amendments to 
Chase & Mahonia docs
Sign-off from you regarding what tenors of US Govts will be acceptable as 
defined in our standard wording for 'Description of Collateral', when we 
amend the docs.
What is anticipated will be required from an operational perspective once the 
docs have been amended, to enable us to start posting securities.

 I additionally requested the following info, and am more than happy to 
review/assist in reviewing the docs so that we are in a position to realise 
the benefits before year end. Wendi has also been very helpful in offering to 
provide the info/docs for the following:
Who are the counterparties where we have existing collateral agreements that 
permit rehypotheaction of securities? Can we immediately start 
rehypothecating these securities once we have signed the Domestic Custody 
Agreement with Chase? If not, what do we need to?
Who are the other counterparties posting us securities?
Counterparties identified to whom we can rehypothecate securities 
Who are we currently in dialogue with re. assignment of securities, & what 
stage of negotiations are we at?

I'm booking in a meeting with you later today to discuss primarily what 
approval levels is for US Govts,  & another transaction.

4773,"This link should get you access to our Financial Trading, or ""Master Swap 
Agreement"" database.  This database lists all the master swap agreements we 
have in place or have drafted in the US, London, Singapore, Japan, South 
America, etc..  It is a very good resource to use when preparing 
confirmations.  This database is available to all Enron employees, so feel 
free to send this link to any London employees you think might find it 
helpful.  There are certain comments concerning the status of masters under 
negotiation that are only available to Legal and Credit employees because of 
legal-client confidentiality concerns.  Any member of your legal team should 
be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active/close 
negotiation on a master, or if a master is being amended, what the amendments 
might address (sometimes helpful when Houston isn't at work yet!).  
Frequently there may be more than one master in place for an Enron company, 
so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a 
specific finance project or product (unusual, but sometimes).  Also, as I 
mentioned, not all the US based masters are ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, so 
look to confirm what type of master we entered into.  If they are not ISDA 
Multi-Currency Masters, it may not be possible to put a cross-border trade 
under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation.

Please note:  there is a listing for ""Restrictions"" which will reflect any 
trading limitations such as ""crude oil trades only"", ""no trades over 2 
years"", contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading 
limitations.  Restrictions should ALWAYS be looked at because they contain 
critical trading guidance.  Another note to watch out for is that many US 
based master may have Texas law instead of NY.  Certainly not UK law.  We 
hope to have that information available in the database in the future.

If for some reason you can't access this database, let me know and we'll get 
our respective computer people to figure out why.

As I mentioned, I am a paralegal in the Houston swap group and am happy to 
answer any questions about particular masters, so please do not hesitate to 
call me at x33399.

4784,"Sara,

I have already had a brief discussion with Tana on some of the points below & 
would appreciate your feedback and clarification on some specific issues.

We are currently looking at ability of Enron to rehypothecate securities 
(principally T-bills) received as collateral. 

Clearly the ability to rehypothecate securities that we hold can provide 
significant benefits. The free up of funds that are being used to post cash 
collateral to counterparties increases our B/S liquidity & reduces the total 
cost of borrowing associated with posting cash.

We are reviewing the use rehypothecation of all securities posting for all 
counterparties. Clement is in the process of executing a domestic custody 
agreement with Chase Manhatten Bank which will facilitate rehypothecation.

More specifically we are looking at the ability to rehypothecate collateral 
related to the most recent Mahonia pre-pay structure (very similar to Alberta 
pre-pay). 
The collateral arrangement within Mahonia provides for back to back transfer 
of collateral right through the structure. This results in a net zero cash 
position if all parties post cash. However if Enron receives securities (from 
Chase) that we cannot reassign (to Mahonia - an SPE), the cash collateral 
calls we are seeing are in the region of $600mm (approx. $42mm/yr in interest 
expense to Enron). 

In the past Chase have interchangeably used securities & cash. They are 
currently posting cash, however they intend to post securities going forward 
for this specific deal.

The most pressing issues going forward:  
Does the existing Chase ISDA permit rehypothecation of securities. We are 
looking at this. If it does not, then we will need to negotiate an amendment 
to the credit support annex. 
Accounting treatment - there are issues around the accounting treatment for 
rehypothecation under the Mahonia transaction, principally relating to the 
acceptability of the same securities posted by Chase being posted  to Mahonia 
SPE (Chase equity in SPE), thus linking all the swaps & potentially bringing 
the pre-pay back on B/S.
We need to justify that we can rehypothecate Chase securities posted within 
the structure. AA's key point is that linkage occurs as the securities posted 
are most likely to be registered to Chase &  these are then posted back to 
Mahonia SPE with Chase equity.

Our case to support the use of Chase securities within the Mahonia pre-pay 
structure relates to:
T-bills are highly liquid instruments & effectively cash equivalent
Securities posted by banks are typically registered to a street name ie a 
brokerage house (ie not registered to Chase), if there is no physical 
delivery. We are verifying that this is the case with the securities posted 
by Chase. 
Market standard contractual terms permit use of these posted securities 

Re the last point, I have looked at our the standard ISDA credit support 
annexe para. 6 (c) relating to Use of Posted Collateral, section (i). It 
appears to say that regardless of a default occurring, the Secured Party 
(Enron) has the right to ""sell, pledge, rehypothecate, assign, invest, use, 
commingle or otherwise dipose of, or otherwise use in its business any Posted 
Collateral it holds............."" Please confirm that that I have not 
misinterpreted this or missed out relevant exclusions 
- Cris, this standard ISDA language should further support our case to AA?.

In addition, I would like to clarify ownership & title to securities that are 
rehypothecated in the event of default if a) Enron receives securities that 
are then rehypothecated & Enron defaults b) the third party receiving 
rehypothecated securities defaults

We are aiming to have the Domestic Custody Agreement executed within the next 
10 days, & we would like to be in a position to assign securities posted to 
us shortly thereafter for the Mahonia deal.

Outside of the Mahonia transaction, there is currently an additional $65mm 
approx. in securities being posted to us by our counterparties. Going forward 
we will:
Establish who are the counterparties where we have existing collateral 
agreements that permit rehypotheaction of securities. 
If we are receiving securities from CP where we are not permitted to 
rehypothecate, we intend to amend the ISDA.

I would very much appreciate you response on use of posted collateral & 
ownership & title to securities in the event of default.

Many thanks,

this year.

Please note that it is the intention of Enron to roll over all of the 
tranches in the current Hawaii facility into this two year facility on the 
closing date.  Accordingly, we have utilized the existing trust and merely 
amended and restated the trust agreement (renaming the trust Hawaii II 
125-0).  Because we are utilizing the same trust, I believe that we can roll 
over the existing tranches with minimal paperwork - perhaps one omnibus 
amendment for each series, setting forth the appropriate references to the 
new Nov 15 documents.

Discussions with LIMITrader are on hold given the departure of their point

from Doug Ford (212-499-1390), our LIMITrader sales contact, as to how to
proceed.

We expect to resume discussions with MarketAxess when that site is nearer to

noted below, the consequential damage issue has been outstanding for more
than a month.  Please let us know when this issue is resolved and when we can

Paperboard Industries Corporation (PIC) as the contracting entity and would 
be willing to provide a corporate guaranty from Paperboard Industries

I am confused as to how many trades actually exist.  Per TAGG, there are two 
(NH9975.1 done on May 12 and Q25809.1 done on October 4); however, in the 
legal database Susan references a September 13 template sent out which Louise 
Paul also mentioned.  Is this a real deal or was it just a draft?

As the May confirm was never signed, I do not know if we will need to 
actually assign it to the new entity.  We need to make sure that all of the 
confirms reference PIC as the contracting entity with PII as guarantor.  All 
of the credit terms apply; however they will apply to the guarantor now 
instead of the counterparty.   I have also changed the MAC trigger to B+ as 
PII has been downgraded from BB- to B+.  I have attached a new credit

______________________________________________________________________________

As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX Division metals 
contracts are prohibited beginning on the tenth business day prior to the 
first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the delivery month.  
Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for the 
November 2000 metals contracts must be completed prior to October 18, 2000.

Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions for NYMEX 
energy contracts are not permitted during the last three trading days of the 
respective contracts.  Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are attached.

If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact Nick Galati 
at (212) 299-2920 or Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919.

NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE

(P) Concurrent Futures Positions

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the concurrent 
position is established the business day prior to the date that the offset 
memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member filing 
such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the delay 
in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its 
clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing 
member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the 
clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest Report.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for 
energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third 
business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract, 
including the termination date.  The current delivery month in platinum and 
palladium commences on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the first 
business day of the delivery month.


COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may not 
be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other bookkeeping 
procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor transactions in 
accordance with Exchange Rules.  Provided, however, that a clearing member 
will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the concurrent position 
is established the business day prior to the date that the open positions are 
filed with the Clearing House.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery month for 
metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth (10th) 
business day, prior to the first business day of the delivery month.

SUBJECT: COPPER WAREHOUSE RATE CHANGE


The following new rate for the handling out charges for copper has been 
submitted to the Exchange by Southwest Commodity Warehouses, Inc. for its 
facilities located at 4619 N. Highway Drive, Tucson, Arizona and #1 Jacobus 
Road, San Manual, Arizona.  Southwest Commodity Warehouses, Inc. is a COMEX 
Licensed Warehouse for the storage of copper deliverable against the COMEX 
Grade 1 Copper Futures Contract.  The new rate will become effective on 
November 1, 2000.  All other charges remain unchanged.


RATES AND CHARGES FOR COPPER

Southwest Commodity Warehouses, Inc. Effective:  November 1, 2000

Handling Out Charge per Short Ton: $22.75

The following previously published charges for the storage and handling of 
copper at Southwest Commodity Warehouses, Inc. remain unchanged.

Handling Inbound per Short Ton: $0.00
Monthly Storage Charge per Short Ton: $3.85
Preparation of Warehouse Receipt: $0.00
Replacement of Each Warehouse Receipt: $5.00
Bill of Lading: $ 5.00
Insurance Premiums: $ 0.00


Please be advised that the warehouses, at their discretion, may require 
handling fees based on the new rates for all copper physically in storage as 
of the effective date.  That is, the old rates are not grandfathered for 
copper already in storage prior to November 1, 2000.

Specific to handling out charges, invoices prepared by COMEX Clearing for 
warrants issued prior to November 1, 2000 should not call for reimbursements 
for handling out charges based on the new rates.  Reimbursements for these 
warrants should be based on the old handling out rate because the warehouse 
was prepaid based on the old handling out rate.  Though the warehouses have 
been prepaid the handling out charges based on the old rate, the party 
shipping the metal out on or after November 1, 2000, may owe the warehouses 
the difference between the old and new rates upon shipment, at the discretion 
of the warehouse.  Clearing Members are advised to carefully review invoices 
to ensure that reimbursement payments are not made for charges that have not 
actually been prepaid by the market short.

Should you have any questions or require any additional information, please 
contact Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608.

The issue which we discussed is authority.  The Merced resolution of March

provide appropriate information, and certifications for completing Master 
Trading (ISDA) Agreements with energy vendors and execute Master Trading 
(ISDA) Agreements and appropriate vendor Schedules to the ISDA Agreement for 
the purpose of acquiring energy and stabilizing energy costs.  Such 
executions are subject to Counsel review of the agreement and schedules as to 
form.""  There is no specific mention of authority to enter into transactions 
(by Merced's traders).
Intuitively one could draw the conclusion that the ISDA Master contemplates 
transactions, Merced authorized the ISDA Master and therefore Merced 
authorized transactions under the ISDA Master.  Since Merced is a 
governmental entity, the safer view is that we should not assume that Merced 
authorized transactions.  Merced probably intended to authorize transactions,

4921,"Hello all,

We want to be closing this deal before the end of the week as well. The parties in this deal are Kleimar N.V. from Antwerp Belgium, and ECTRIC through EEFT. We are entering into a Time Charter agreement, where Kleimar charters a vessel from us (the one obtained in the original Mitsui deal) , and then through a Contract of Affreightment we will be receiving five voyages (different ships). I will follow up on the timing of these in my next email.

We will put in place a Master Agreement which should allow us to net out these two contracts (the Time Charter and the COA) as well as any other future physical business we enter into with them, if anything goes wrong. The Master sets out default and cross default events. This will allow us to have tighter control over the counterparty. I have attached a draft of the Master Agreement which will be signed at the same time as the Time Charter and the COA. So overall this deal will have three documents. The Time Charter, the COA and the Master Agreement.

Kleimar is giving us a Letter of Credit for 250,000 to cover our exposure, which has been agreed by Credit. We will be receiving the Time Charter and COA docs shortly which I will send around. The changes in those documents reflect the principles in the Master Agreement. Please let me know if anyone has any concerns or issues with this deal as soon as possible. (0207 783 4084).

4951,"Becky and I attended FERC's gas marketing affiliate conference last week.  
Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses 
with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity 
hoarding are two examples.  The funny money argument assumes marketing 
affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess 
payment is going to the corporate bottom line.  Hoarding capacity to drive up 
price  may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone 
can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, 
but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to 
require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller 
entities put together bids.  FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing 
compliance, but in a non-public way.

There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an 
opportunity to file additional comments on Apr. 30.  I would like to put the 
following in these comments:

Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there.  The best folks can 
do is make up stuff.
We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the 
marketplace that abuse is not occurring.  But the issue is really whether we 
do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors 
who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors).
The FERC rules and the information reported (with a caveat) under those rules 
are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence.
That said, the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to 
include affiliated electric generators, who are siting plants along affiliate 
pipelines.
The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to 
download and manipulate transportation related data, which is not currently 
the case.

We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a 
discount, albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid.  
This was a deal brought up in the conference.

Let me know how this sounds. Thanks.",Becky,,FERC ENA

Direct access customers are exempt from the surcharge. 
In giving its first hint on what it will do with the PX credit process, it 
said ""we will proceed to reexamine and redesign the direct access credit 
system to reflect current structural reality.""  (Translation - no 
market-based PX credits)
Each customer class is allocated an equal 3 cents, plus an amount to cover 
the shortfall from having residential usage up to 130% of baseline exempt 
from the surcharge (as required by law). Responsibility for residential 
subsidy is split one third each to residential, commercial, and industrial
The new rates become effective June 1, and the shortfall from the actual 
effective date of the increase, March 27, through June 1 will be amortized 
over 12 months.
Residential rate design - 5 tiers put in place.  No increase up to 130% of 
baseline (first 2 tiers), rate for fifth tier (above 300% of baseline) is 
about doubled.
Non-residential rate design - recommendations to put all of the increase into 
summer on-peak were rejected.  About 60% of increase put into summer.  
Industrial customers get a bill limiter which caps the average increase for a 
given customer to 12.3 cents/kwh for PG&E and 12.9 cents/kwh for SCE.
Real Time Pricing was endorsed - will further explore in workshops starting 
later in May.  Voluntary program will be started.

4956,"As most of you are aware, the FERC mediator yesterday submitted his 
recommendation to the agency, culminating a 15-day mediation process. Among 
the mediator's recommendations is that FERC convene an evidentiary hearing, 
to close within 60 days, to determine the offset or refund liability of 
suppliers of energy, including Enron, into the California's spot markets.  I 
expect FERC to act on the recommendation early next week and issue an order 
directing that a hearing be convened within possibly a week or less.  
Accordingly, getting organized is an imperative.

Several of us participated in a conference call yesterday to discuss whether 
Enron should retain Seabron Adamson of Frontier Economics to serve as Enron's 
expert in the hearing.  The decision was made to retain Seabron for this 
purpose.  Seabron has informed me that he can come to Washington to start 
preparing discovery and developing a theory for Enron's case.  The discovery 
that Enron pursues will obviously need to be coordinated with litigation 
counsel representing Enron in the various California civil litigations and 
investigations.

The mediator's recommendation largely ignores two of the issues that were set 
for mediation (moving CA power supply to the forward markets and restoring 
creditworthiness of CA purchasers) and instead deals exclusively with the 
third issue:  Did any supplier overcharge for post-October 1, 2000, 
short-term (24 hrs or less) sales into the PX and ISO and, if so, should the 
supplier refund the overcharge or have it offset against amounts owed the 
supplier?

The mediator did not find a specific overcharge amount. Instead, he opined 
that, while not the $8.9 billion claimed by the CA delegation, overcharges 
""do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion 
dollars in an aggregate sum.""

Per the mediator's recommendation, the evidentiary hearing should address the 
details of a methodology for determining how much each supplier overcharged.  
The ""single"" methodology recommended by the mediator is a modified, 
retroactive application of the price ceiling that FERC ordered imposed 
prospectively on the entire west in a June 19 order.  That methodology 
classes as an overcharge any amount charged between October 2, 2000, and May 
28, 2001, that exceeded the operating cost of the least efficient gas-fired 
turbine dispatched in CA in an hour plus an adder for O&M, a credit premium 
and NOx.  The recommended methodology deviates from the prospective price 
ceiling in several respects, including that it would be applied in all hours, 
without discount, and would reflect actual heat rates and separate actual 
hourly natural gas prices for southern CA and northern CA, resulting in two 
separate proxy prices.

The mediator recommends that this methodology be applied to all suppliers, 
even those that did not supply power wholly from gas-fired turbines.   
Nevertheless, in a contradictory passage, the mediator goes on to recognize 
that his recommended methodology ""may not be appropriate for all sellers,"" 
but that any sellers advocating a different methodology ""should bear the 
burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the 
methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period..""  (emphasis 
added).

Assuming that the agency largely follows the recommendation of the mediator, 
then it appears Enron, working through Seabron, can pursue one or two basic 
theories.  First and most simply, Enron can accede to the mediator's 
methodology and work with the large generators (Duke, Reliant, Dynegy, 
Mirant) to force up the proxy price (and lower the overcharge amount) that 
the mediator's methodology produces.  Alternatively, in addition to trying to 
force up the proxy price, Enron can try to develop a theory that the 
mediator's methodology either should not apply to power marketers or should 
apply differently to them.  This second approach will likely be joined by 
other non-thermal generator suppliers, such as PowerEx.  The obvious risk in 
pursing this second approach is that Enron might become exposed to discovery 
into the cost basis of its book over the entire refund period..

Those of you who will need or want to discuss the issues with Seabron, please 
respond by letting me know as between Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next 
week, which works better for you for a meeting in Washington or a 
teleconference.  ",Seabron Adamson Seabron,"$8.9 billion hundreds of millions of dollars more than a billion

Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate
By Bryan Lee

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.
The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO. 
The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers. 
FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort. 
Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that ""a bunch of bureaucrats"" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of ""what it does for local reliability."" 
DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing. ",DeFazio Bryan Lee Peter DeFazio,,"Pacific NW FERC Dow Jones Energy Service Dow Jones & Company, Inc. DOW JONES the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's D-Ore Enron Corp. ENE"

Senator Bingaman (D-NM) chaired the New Democratic Network (NDN) energy 
breakfast this morning. He told me he was looking forward to meet with Ken 
later in the day.   He talked about how his Committee plans to proceed, 
beginning with the release today to Senators of a document that identifies 
issues that were included in both the Murkowski and Bingaman drafts of energy 
legislation.  He hopes to make this the starting point for bipartisan 
comprehensive legislation.
Bob Simon, Committee Staff Director, told me he was interested in working 
with Enron.

After Sen. Bingaman departed, Reps. Cal Dooley (D-CA), Ron Kind (D-WI), Adam 
Smith (D-WA), and Rick Larsen (D-WA) talked about the New Dems energy plan.  
They restated their intent to focus on policy and not the rhetoric being 
spread by the Democratic Leadership.  They also say they want a ""goal"" to 
reach, for instance, energy independence by 2020.    I mentioned open access 
on the electricity grid as a mid-term energy policy goal.

Follow up:  I spoke to Rep. John Larson's staff about our investment in  fuel 
cell technology in Connecticut.  They called and want to meet with us next 
Wednesday.

DLC 

The DLC is currently considering energy policy and Peter Fox Penner is 
leading the drafting.  They hope to have the plan developed and released in 
the next month or so. Their proposal will focus on the following issues: 

The pre-California regulatory environment clearly did not work as it should.  
How can we improve FERC, state and local regulatory regimes to avoid another 
California.

Mandate a ""Clean Quarter"":  Ensure that at least a quarter of all new energy 
production come from ""clean"" energy  sources defined by low emissions 
output.  The goal is to increase renewable energy, but it is unrealistic to 
deny the need for fossil fuels.  So the DLC would look to mandate renewables 
and cleaner burning fossil fuels.

Encourage deregulation and competition,  through support and transition 
funds.  The goals is to ease the transition into deregulate markets and the 
volatility that often accompany such a transition.  Create investment funds 
(like a Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) to make a move to competitive markets 
easier and less threatening.

Create a market to tradeable Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard 
units.

 On transmission, the DLC would expand transmission by creating binding 
Regional Electricity Siting Compacts that would ease eminent domain issues.

4P and 3P trading programs.  The DLC would support efforts  to expand 
emissions trading beyond S02, to NO2 and Mercury (and possibly CO2).  I spoke 
to Pat Shortridge and Lisa Jacobsen and will offer them up to the DLC as 
experts on these programs.

Full-scale reexamination of Nuclear as a viable energy source.

Encourage real-time pricing to avoid reliance on spot markets.

Mandate new buildings be constructed ""smart"" and provide incentives to 
encourages large industrials and buildings to outsource their energy needs.  


Follow up:  The DLC is going to look to Enron for ideas on how to structure 
these proposals over the coming weeks.  Perhaps Rick Shapiro could spend some 
time with Peter Fox Penner and Will Marshall when he is in town next week.

4971,"I talked to Bill Butler after this came out. Bill and Judge Miller supposedly 
advised the Governor that this moratorium was not a good idea. I suggested to 
Bill that LG&E was behind this, but he told me that the Gov is also planning 
a Senate run, and that this move is related. I also mentioned this to Johnny 
Hayes. Between Bill and Johnny, I should be able to get more info. Bill also 
told me he was named to the State energy committee.

We are working on Calvert, but as we have already applied for an air permit, 
we are only potentially affected to the extent we modify the equipment in our 
application. As such, I would like to see the text of the Governor's order to 
determine if equipment changes for applications already submitted would be 
precluded. Dave Kellermeyer / Scott Churbock are also looking into this.

As you know, we face a similar moratorium in Georgia. I have asked Johnny 
Hayes to find out if there is any movement in TN with respect to a moratorium.

I think for right now, my group's main need is to (i) understand the KY 
moratorium and whether it precludes us from changing equipment in our air 
permit application; (ii) whether a moratorium could spread to TN (we have a 
couple more sites we're working on there); and (iii) if we can leverage any 
political connections in GA to help us navigate the particulars of that 
state's moratorium.  

Barbara, toward that end, it would be helpful if you would contact Raimund 
Grube (x 3-0433) on Georgia, and Chris Booth (x 5-3364) on Tennessee. I'd 
like you to work with them and Churbock / Kellermeyer on answering these 
three questions.

Thanks much.

4975,"Once again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity 
legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other 
interested parties including industry segments, public power and state 
regulators.  The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve 
Largent and Chip Pickering.

After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an 
agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an 
electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package 
that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next 
week.  Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the 
discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine 
whether to proceed further.  There is a general perception that committee 
leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in 
the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported 
legislation.

In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained 
over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines.  As the drafts 
progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language 
that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and 
federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action 
in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case.

A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together 
a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the 
understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to 
our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal 
siting.  However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant 
interest groups not willing to go along.  Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to 
link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO.

There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection 
and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the 
details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the 
minimalist package.

There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks 
floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have 
made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market 
rates.  Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others.

As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up 
occurs.  In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and 
other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will 
take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday.  That package will 
have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and 
reformulated gasoline.  Details to follow once legislative language is 
released.","Tom DeLay Steve

but that still entails a change of ownership, perhaps not ultimate ownership, 
but at least structure (as you put it, a 'separate corporate entity'). If one 
looks at the jurisprudence in the Transparency Directive Case, a requirement 
to make accounts transparent and unbundled was OK, but by implication a 
requirement to legally unbundle was not.

In passing, the Transparency Directive Case is the thing to mention if anyone 
ever argues that nuclear power is not subject to State Aid rules. In that 
case, the French argued that introducing transparency into EdF accounts would 
contravene the Euratom treaty as EdF was a nuclear producer.  The Commission 
wanted transparency in order to enforce the state aid rules under the EC 
rules. France lost. The Court said that any entity that was supplying into a 
commercial market was subject to the EC rules.  You often still see the myth 
that nuclear power is outside the state aid rules.

- the German Parliment voted for a open hearing in conjunction with 
deliberations over the revision to the Energy Law. We had
been pushing hard for such a hearing so as to be able to get EFET and other 
like-minded associations to voice our
concerns about the lack of real market opening in the gas and power markets. 
The hearing is now scheduled for th 24th
of Sept and I will probably speak on behalf of EFET Germany.

Possible Application of Article 86 by EU Commission to Force Greater/More 
Rapid Market Opening
- Tensions between Germany and the EU on lack of  implementation of the Gas 
Directive and German instransigence on
regulated TPA and cross-border issues continues to build. Indeed, the 
atmosphere is quite tense now and it seems likely
that the EU will no employ the ""nuclear option"" of Article 86 to force 
greater and more rapid market opening in member
states. (Peter can add to this)

Gas VV Negotiations Difficult: German Cartel Office Sends Highly Critical 
Letter to Associations
- The negotiations of amendments to the German Gas network agreement continue 
to move at a snail's pace.Key issues
that we have argued for (cost-based tarriffs, development of standard 
transport and storage contracts, replacement of 
point-to-point tariff model with an exit/entry system) have yet to be 
addressed -largely because the gas industry is
wholly opposed to making these part of the negotiations. The negotiating 
associations to the network agreement (so-called 
VV-Gas) have been criticized in a letter from the head of the German Cartel 
Office. He concludes that there efforts have
not produced a basis for gas competition in Germany and that if significant 
progress is not made in the next few months, 
the Cartel Office does not see how Germany can continue to defend the model 
of negotiated access and may have
to accept a regulated solution.

Negotiation Begin for Access to Baltic Cable
After many months of correspondence and insistence by Philip Davies that 
Baltic Cable provide us with terms for
TPA, the new managment of Baltic Cable has agreed to meet with us to 
negotiate access. Negotiations will begin
with Eon (now manager of Baltic) on the 11th.

OMV/Tag Finco
Some weeks ago we initiated a formal proceeding against the Austrian pipeline 
company for effective denial of access
to their long-distance pipe running to Italy. After several hours of 
hearings, the Ministry accepted Enron's complaint and 
rejected OMV's petition to withdraw the complaint. The Ministry provided 
clear indications to OMV that they would
prefer a negotiated settlement but were ready to proceed with a full-scale 
investigation if necessary. The pressure
was sufficient to bring OMV to the table and we are now in the process of 
trying to reach closure of firm capacity
through Austria and into Italy.Should we fail to conclude agreement by July 
15th, the case against OMV will
resume.

4993,"Just to underline that these reports confirm what I had reported 
independently, namely that if the Commission is thwarted by the Member States 
over the acceleration directives and regulation that the Commission will use 
its powers unilaterally to pass the legislation using an Art 86(2) Directive 
(previously only used in the telecomms sector, these powers allow the 
Commission to not even consult the Member States or the European 
parliament).  The Commission has legal authority to do this and political 
cover as the Stockholm Conclusions indicate the strengthened use of 
competition law. Art 86 of the Amsterdam Treaty is within the Competition 
provisions. That said, one can see a definitive timetable emerging for market 
liberalisation; my bet is that the laws will be in place by this time next 
year, just after the French elections.  This contradicts the estimate 
supplied by some Parlementarians in the newspapers, such as todays FT, which 
suggest a five year time frame; perhaps the MEPs don't realise that the 
legislation may never get to them.

An interesting thought: if the legislation is passed under Art 86 we may get 
better legislation: there will be no need to compromise for Council and 
parliament sensitivities.

?Dear Chairman Bingaman:??The undersigned groups representing state and loc=

measures for responding to electricity restructuring issues.??As you know, =
the National Governors Association passed the attached policy at their Annu=
al Meeting in Rhode Island earlier this month. The National Governors Assoc=
iation (NGA) policy reaffirms the Governors' opposition to a legislative pr=
oposal which would establish federal eminent domain authority over electric=
ity transmission facilities. The Governors also agreed to establish a task =
force to provide a forum for states, the private sector, and the Administra=
tion to examine and discuss ways to ease bottlenecks in the transmission an=
d energy infrastructure system. Late last year, the National Conference of =
State Legislatures (NCSL) updated its National Energy Policy which was form=
ally adopted August 15 at its Annual Meeting. This policy reinforces its op=
position to Federal preemption of state authority over electric facility si=
ting. Also at its Annual Meeting, NCSL adopted an Energy Regionalism policy=
 that supports states working together to address siting and reliability co=
ncerns on a regional basis. In addition, by letter addressed to you dated J=
uly 23, 2001, the NCSL reiterated its strong opposition to federal eminent =
domain authority for electricity transmission lines. And in July 2001, the =
National Association of Counties (NACo) adopted a Resolution on National En=
ergy Policy outlining county officials' opposition to FERC eminent domain a=
uthority without the provision of specific requirements that strengthen the=
 role of counties in planning for the siting of these lines. The report pre=
pared for the Western Governors Association entitled, ""Conceptual Plans for=
 Electricity Transmission in the West,"" also provides new avenues for devel=
opment of transmission facilities. Finally, as the attached ""Electricity Po=
licy Principles"" document, organizations representing virtually every organ=
ization of state and local officials affected by electricity restructuring =
have spoken with one voice that the regulation of rights of way necessary f=
or expanded utility infrastructure should remain with state and local gover=
nmental officials. In short, action is occurring at the state and regional =
level.??Before any decision is made regarding federal siting legislation (i=
ncluding eminent domain authority), it should first be established through =
an independent analysis or study that it is in fact the action, or inaction=
, of state and local governments that is preventing electric transmission l=
ines from being sited. Thus far only anecdotal information concerning these=
 purported siting barriers has been conveyed to the Congress and the Admini=
stration - primarily by electric transmission companies and their trade org=
anizations.??With this in mind, the NGA - Center for Best Practices has est=
ablished an Energy Task Force that, in collaboration with other state and l=
ocal organizations, will review and make recommendations about siting issue=
s, along with electricity generation and regional market issues. We ask tha=
t you give deference to this Task Force and its recommendations before movi=
ng forward with any legislative mandates or preemptive language in a legisl=
ative proposal.??Sections 201 and 202 of S. 597 offer both a policy on regi=
onal coordination and federal support for such efforts. This is a good star=
t, worthy of serious consideration and analysis by the Congress. However, f=
ederal preemption is a draconian step completely inconsistent with reasonab=
le views of federalism and energy policy. In fact, many view the problems t=
hat have developed in restructuring as primarily failings at the federal le=
vel. Enhanced federal authority in that situation may well be counterproduc=
tive.??Additionally, certain proposals contained in your September 6 draft =
legislation on electricity issues would unreasonably constrain state effort=
s to address electricity restructuring by increasing federal authority. The=
 proposals for enhanced federal jurisdiction over both bundled and unbundle=
d transmission services, a legislative mandate to participate in RTOs, emin=
ent domain authority for FERC, along with several other provisions pre-empt=
ing State and local authority, limit the important adjudicatory and regulat=

I have read through the 19 pages of Administration comments on the Bingaman draft electricity bill released last month.  Here are the main items in a quick bullet format so you have the flavor of them.

Delete provision on federal jurisdiction over bundled/unbundled (they don't offer a reason).  We of course agree for tactical reasons.

Add a provision to authorize FERC to order wheeling in States that open retail markets.

Add a provision to allow FERC to issue wheeling orders on its own motion based on an informal hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing as under current law.

Make it clear that the Federal Power Act does not affect the authority of a State to require retail competition (the comments say some utilities have tried to argue that the FPA prohibits states).

The provision giving FERC power to order RTO participation should be deleted.  The comments raise drafting question.

The changes to the FERC merger review sections of the FPA should be limited.

""FERC lite"" should be extended only to state municipal utilities and cooperatives, not the Federal utilities.  The FERC should authority over the Federal transmission systems equivalent to FERC authority over public utilities (with special BPA rules).

No need to legislate on market-based rates (we oppose the Bingaman language anyway, so this is helpful).

Interconnection language should be limited to transmission facilities, not local distribution.

No objection to streamlined reliability provision (this is good for us).

Remedial measures for market power should be deleted.

Administration to provide legislative language on federal transmission siting provisions, which they want to retain.

Not convinced there is a need for market transparency rules because FERC and DOE already have enough authority.

Administration supports even tougher criminal penalties.

Recordkeeping under PUHCA repeal should be clarified.

Federal purchase requirement for renewable energy should be deleted.

No objection to real-time pricing standard.

Net metering should be limited to small residential renewable facilities.

Do not support federal renewable portfolio standard (but could clarify state authority to adopt same).

The EISB  new By-Laws will be publicly available in a couple/few weeks.  It will be able to accomodate ANY type of organization for each of it quadrants.  If the Wholesale Electric Quadrant (WEQ) wants to include both reliability and commercial standards, it may.  If the WEQ wants only to address commerical it may...and every permutation of the two.  So, EISB is flexible enough.  One possibility that has been proposed (and I believe it comes from the NERC staff) is that NERC could be ""reliability only"" and operate with a Memorandum of Understanding with the EISB WEQ that would be focused on commercial issues.  Not a winner for us - but just to show you how flexible the EISB charter will be.

5005,"In a surprise procedural development, FERC has announced that it will accept written comments by both parties and non-parties to the ALJ's recommendations issued last month.  These comments are due by 10/31.  This is somewhat unusual because the case has been fully litigated and briefed and we had expected the full Commission to vote on this matter next week.  Some people think FERC is simply buying itself more time because it is preoccupied with other matters (although I'm not sure why they wouldn't simply just sit on the case for a few more weeks if that was the case).  A few parties have been in touch with Sen. Cantwell's office - they do not believe her office has been lobbying FERC - although they also report that Cantwell's staff is working on a letter to FERC to express her general dissatisfaction with the ALJ decision.  Another big concern in Cantwell's office is minimizing the refund liability of PNW parties in the CA case.  

In light of these developments, perhaps we should contact Cantwell's office to discuss the case and its implications for the PNW.  Also, it appears that Sen. Murray is not so upset about the ALJ decision and views the whole affair much differently than Cantwell - maybe we should touch base with her as well.  From what I understand, the City of Seattle (the main driver for the refund proponents) was prepared to pack it in - they may see this as a second chance, and we should make sure our view gets heard.

Finally, here it is. This is my first take to the risk analysis guidelines. It provides a review of the Scenario Analysis methodology and makes the case, that although imperfect, is the most appropriate methodology. There are many questions that still need to be responded, in particular the details on how we
re going to implement this thing internally. It assumes that we would closely with RAC and therefore, rely on their infrastructure, policies and procedures to complete our analysis. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to let me know. Have a very happy and succesful year,

5008,"Great job on MISO Mike!


",Mike,,
5009,"Yesterday, at the Midwest ISO, we successfully managed to quash the MISO's 
""at least one source-to-sink reservation"" proposal.

MISO has been attempting to figure out a way to do security analysis on 
transmission reservations, and felt that the Entergy Source/Sink policy was 
too restrictive, but the policy of not requiring source-to-sink at any point 
was too relaxed.  Their proposal was that ""at least one"" reservation on a 
tag/schedule must have the true source-to-sink; otherwise, the tag/schedule 
would be denied for improper use.

Representatives from CINergy, Duke, Dynegy, ACES, Ameren and LG&E worked with 
me to fight this concept, arguing that it was effectively identical to the 
Entergy Source/Sink policy in almost all cases.  After a meeting and two 
conference calls, in which the MISO ignored our comments and continually 
pressed for their option, we finally managed to convince them that it was 
unacceptable.  

The new policy that MISO is planning to operate under is as follows:

 1.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation 
specified accurate source and sink, the tag/schedule will be approved.
 2.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation 
did NOT specify accurate source and sink, but analysis indicates the 
transaction can flow without compromising reliability, the tag/schedule will 
be approved
 3.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation 
did NOT specify accurate source and sink, and analysis indicates the 
transaction cannot flow without compromising reliability (i.e., the 
transaction will cause or contribute to a constraint), the tag/schedule will 
be denied

While this is not as unrestrictive as we might want, it allows us a great 
deal more flexibility that the Entergy Source/Sink barrier while at the same 
time allaying the MISO's reliability concerns.  Effectively, this allows us 
to redirect both firm and non-firm at the time of tagging/scheduling without 
a loss in transmission priority.  Not only will this give us more flexibility 
within MISO, but the MISO intends to sell it to the Alliance as well under 
the IRCA.  

This also can give us a cornerstone in proving to the FERC that the Entergy 
S/S policy is not required for reliability, as other entities are able to 
meet reliability goals without the stifling limits Entergy claims are 
necessary.

As an aside, we are also pressing the MISO for a Redirection policy that will 
allow for ""partial"" redirects of service on a short term basis (the Separate 
proposal referenced in the attached document).  This will allow us to 
accomplish the same goals as the new MISO policy, but reduce the availability 
risk by allowing us to redirect prior to the time the transaction is 
tagged/scheduled.  These two proposals, when combined, will allow us for much 
more flexible uses of transmission without ignoring the reliability mantra 
providers chant whenever we ask for innovation and change. 

A detailed write-up of the work accomplished is attached.  Proposal 4, 
Discussion item ""Confusing POR/POD Naming,"" Discussion Item ""MISO Proposal  
...time of scheduling,"" and the Resolutions should be of primary interest to 
those wishing to see more detail on the directions MISO is heading.

I attach a note I wrote for the head of Continental Trading that lays out the work that I -  
with support from the origination and regulatory collegeauges- have been engaged in. It is reasonably current. 
The examples of transaction support that have resulted in $$, are from the second half of 2000. The first six months
of this year have been focussed on advocacy work related to the revision of the German energy
law, negotiating a network agreement for gas, supporting EU investigations in abusive practices
and building up stronger political relationships through our trade association - EFET. 

The deal support efforts from this year thus far relate to:

Significant support provided to the German origination team to secure transport across Germany,
Switzerland, and Italy to provide gas to our first Italian customers. My work was focussed on 
getting the Swiss gas company to the negotiating table (something they were very reluctant to do) through
regulatory/legal pressures. Currently doing the same to secure TPA  to the Trans Austria gas pipeline and
the Baltic Cable - again employing our now well-established regulatory and legal pressures (bad cop tactics)
Gas pipeline access in Austria will allow us to significantly increase volume supplied to our Italian customers
Baltic access will allow us to begin actively arbitraging power price differentials between Germany and
Nordpool. Each of these will be firsts for newcomers in the European market. 

I hope this helps, Paul

I am writing to you to express my desire to be apart of the Wholesale Power and Gas Trading operation that will potentially be created with an entity that has a high credit rating.  I have been working for Rogers Herndon in Enron Wholesale Services on the Options Desk.  In this role I have modeled the power options that are embedded in the various deals done through Enron Energy Services with large industrial and commercial clients.  In addition, I profitably managed the positions and priced deals for structurers and originators.  I realize that now is a difficult time but am confident that I would make an excellent addition to your team for several key reasons:
 
?         Proven experience in the financial markets and direct trading experience in various markets, including electricity and natural gas, mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign exchange, EuroCurrency and EuroDollar deposits
?         Team player and high work ethic, successfully balancing trading opportunities with managing risk
?         Solid portfolio management and risk management experience in electricity and mortgage banking 
?         Five years direct experience in trading, risk management, structured products and marketing of electricity for the United States
?         Actively involved in the physical markets and strong understanding of the western grid
?         Experience trading OTC forwards and options at major hubs in other NERC regions such as Cinergy, Entergy, ERCOT, NEPOOL and PJM
?         Worked for both unregulated power marketers and regulated utility
?         Extensive experience in derivatives and structured products
?         Ability to effectively work with marketers pricing and structuring deals for industrial and commercial end users of energy
?         Strength in mentoring junior traders

5031,"Per our discussion, here is where we are on the Devon / Midcon (now Oneok) 
Quinduno well  issue:

For the Devon purchase, we have been showing a price of the NGPL-Midcontinent 
index + $.01 less $.3276 gathering--the 8.5% fuel was never shown in Sitara 
and has never been deducted from Devon's purchase price as it should have 
been.  This purchase falls under the ""big"" Devon deal that came to us from 
CES--it is my understanding that this contract ends in July of this year.
 Mary Ellenberger handles Devon and should take care of the 8.5% fuel issue 
retroactively to January 2000.

For the Midcon Texas (now Oneok) sale, we have been showing in Sitara the 
NGPL-Midcontinent index less 8.5% fuel--the $.3276 gathering fee has never 
showed up in Sitara as a deduction from the sales price as it should have 
been.  Also, Oneok has never paid ENA for this gas all the way back to 
January 2000 due to the fact that there was no contract.
 George Smith is taking care of the Midcon (now Oneok) issue.  For March 
forward, Oneok has made it clear to George that they want to negotiate a 
price with us for this production.  They have agreed to take all production 
between 1/00 and 2/01 at NGPL Index flat less $.3276 gathering , less 8.5% 
fuel.

When this is all cleaned up, the difference between the 8.5% fuel charge we 
will receive from Devon vs. the $.3276 gathering fee we will not collect from 
Midcon Texas is the adjustment that should hit your desk.  I do not have all 
the actual volumes but, when I just use the volumes in Sitara under the 
Midcon tickets, and do the fuel calculations for Devon vs the gathering fee 
we did not account for, the impact was less than $20,000 (positive).  
Therefore, even after actuals are used, I don't expect the amount to be 
significant one way or the other

Attached is a resume from an acquaintance of mine.  Nice guy and would be
credit to anyone's organization.  Thought you  might forward it to
personnel.

Don't forget you've got a lifetime warranty on the drywall in your house.
My compliments.  Call me if you have any problems.  Also I walked your new
building last week.  Quite impressive, especially what we're having to
build on a tight schedule.  Should really be nice.  If you'd like a
personal tour, let me know.  I'd love to put you in a hardhat and introduce
you to the team that's doing all the work.  Would make a great shot for my
in-house publication and maybe yours as well.

Miss seeing you at our Forum meetings.  WPO is not as much fun as YPO.

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.",Mark Breese Eric Moon Eric Boyt Santiago Garcia Melissa Solis Ed McMichael	,,ENA EES ECR Associates and Analysts

Sorry that I missed the get together at SMU last month, but from the
looks of the photos I've seen, a good time was had by all. Hope this
finds you healthy and doing well. My wife and I had dinner last night
with Tom and Betsy McSoley, and your name came up in conversation while
talking about the reunion. I wanted to touch base with you with a
possible business start up idea that may fit into the types of online
services you offer with Enron. We are currently developing an online
licensing agency for the illustration and photographic markets, and I
would like to share the idea and our business plan with you to see if
there is any interest in what promises to be a growing marketplace.
While some companies are currently involved in the photographic end of
this business environment (GettyImages, Corbis), we feel we have a
competitive advantage in that our management team consists of some of
the top illustrators in the field as well as two of the best
intellectual attorneys in the country. We currently have 250 artists and
their collective body of work signed up, and are now in the capital
raising stage, with a launch date of June 2001. I'd love the opportunity
to talk with you further if you think this might be of interest to you.
When time permits, please give me a call at 317 253 3141 and I'd be
happy to share more with you at that time. Thanks for giving this your
consideration Rocky, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

5107,"Background: Because of the situation that has arisen with ConEd (NY) rejecting our parental guaranty and asking EES to put up a 1 million dollar LC, bond, or cash for our retail operations behind ConEd; and in the light of the ongoing financial issues and credit downgrades facing Enron, it has become necessary to evaluate our positions
and available options in various markets relative to creditworthiness issues, and the continued ability of EES to serve customers behind specific utilities.
For Texas this evaluation is important given the outstanding success of the TX team in enrolling customers and the contracts and volumes currently outstanding.
This analysis will focus on the present credit rating of Enron, and consider any possible further down grades.


Enron's Current Credit Rating of BBB and Baa2
1.  To remain a credit worthy counter party within the provisions of the Tariff for Retail Service, EES must have and maintain a long term unsecured credit rating of not less than BBB- or Baa3. 

2.  Pursuant to Art 4.4.5 of the Tariff for Retail Service, EES has an obligation to pay to the TDSP (Wires Company) all invoiced delivery charges 35 calendar days after invoicing, (plus a 10 day grace period - total 45 calendar days) regardless of whether or when it receives payment from the customer. 

3. Under Art. 4.5.1 of the Tariff for Retail Service, a TDSP shall not require deposits from EES as long as we remain current on our obligations for the T & D portion of the bill.
( a deposit can only be required if a REP has defaulted within the past 24 months).

4. In the event that EES defaults, we will be required to provide a deposit. Required deposit is 1/6th (one-sixth) of the estimated annual billable amount for the wires charges.
Alternatively, we could at our option, choose to provide a cash, surety bond, LC, parent guaranty or any combination of these. Additionally, EES can negotiate with the relevant TDSP to reach a mutually suitable agreement.

5. EES is not rated and technically can be required by any TDSP in TX,  to provide security today. If such a request is made, a parental guaranty from Enron corp will suffice, given our current rating of BBB and Baa2 by Moody's and S& P. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required tariff level, the following will be applicable:

Enron's Credit Rating goes below BBB- or Baa3
1. EES will be required to provide a deposit for wires charges.

2. Deposit will be 1/6th of the estimated annual wires charges of the relevant utility, and will be in the nature of bonds, LC, or cash.

3. Failure to provide or maintain acceptable creditworthiness could result in the following:
	- Request to the Commission for suspension or revocation of EES's license to market in TX
	- Transfer of the billing and collection responsibility for all EES charges to the POLR, with customer payments allocated first to wires and non-bypassable chares, 	and remainder to EES
	- Transfer of customer payments to a lock box controlled by the TDSP, with payments allocated first to wires and non-bypassable charges
	-Transfer of EES's customer to another REP or to the POLR.
4. Legal remedies.

Transition Charges: (Art 4.5 of the Tariff, Schedule TC to the Tariff, and Chapter 25.108 of the  Rules). 
1. For TDSPs that are subject to a PUC financing order (Reliant, TXU and CP&L), EES will bill and collect (on behalf of the bond servicer) transition charges from its (EES's) customers

2. Payments of transition charges to the servicer are due from EES 35 calendar days from bill date with a 10 day grace period.

3.  EES is required to provide seperate security for transition charges. 

4.  EES must have and maintain a long term unsecured credit rating of not less than BBB- or Baa3 from Moody's or S&P, or provide
	- a cash deposit of 2 months maximum expected transition charge collections
	- an affiliate parent guaranty, surety bond, or LC for the 2 month amount
	- or a combination of the above.

5. EES is not rated, so technically we may be required to provide the security today. If such a request is made, a parental guaranty from Enron corp will suffice, given our current rating of BBB and Baa2 by Moody's and S& P.

6. If Enron Corp is downgraded below BBB or Baa3, that will trigger a request for deposit or other security.

7. Upon request for a security for transition charges, EES must provide required security within 10 calendar days.

8. Upon failure to provide or maintain required security, the consequences outlined in the previous section will result.

9. To avoid all these, EES could contract with the TDSP to bill and collect transition customers fro EES's customers.",Baa2,1 million dollar,EES Enron Current Credit Rating BBB the Tariff for Retail Service TDSP Wires Company REP LC Enron corp Moody's and S& P.

Vernon  believes that the issue of whether purchase power/transmission costs and similar  costs should offset any refunds alleged owed to purchasers should be expressly  made an Issue II/III testimony issue (i.e., January 2001 filing date) in  the procedural schedule in this proceeding--to the extent these issues are  properly in this proceeding under the Commission's order herein this docket so  far in any event.  Vernon obviously has a direct interest in these issues.  See Vernon last request for rehearing.
 
Vernon  believes that the Presiding Judge was quite clear on this at the 11/6  conference.  Moreover, Vernon would not consider this a change in view by  His Honor nor a change in the existing procedural schedule.  Nevertheless,  Vernon believes that the new version of the procedural schedule should spell out  the Issue II/III treatment.

The parties to Docket No. EL00-95-045 had a one-hour phone  call this afternoon to discuss ways to identify material for which it is  appropriate to lift the protective order.  
The ISO is prepared to release all claims for protection,  except for certain gas data which comes from a commercial gas index  service.  The ISO is negotiating with that company to allow release of  those data.
Many of the participants who filed material under seal  did so because their exhibits were based on claims of privilege by the ISO  or other parties.   All parties who have submitted material under seal  will send to the ISO by Wednesday, November 28, COB East Coast time, a  list of their claims of privilege.  They will state
(1) whether the claim is derivative (i.e. it is based on a  source's claim of privilege.)
(2) if it is not derivative whether the protective order can  be lifted, or
(3) whether they are still claiming protection for the  material.
By Friday, Nov. 30, the ISO will circulate a list to the judge  and the participants showing the material for which protection is, and is  not, still claimed.
The participants who file rebuttal testimony will be  prepared to explain the basis for any claims of  protection for  the rebuttal testimony in the conference on December 13, 2001.  The  participants will also use best efforts to identify by December 13, 2001 any  documents which they plan to use for cross-examination which may be subject to  claims of protection.

5139,"For clarification, let me summarize my understanding of discussions held over the past few weeks concerning data requests and reports from your group and from CSC.  For forecasting and scheduling purposes in both established and new markets, we need to develop the following products and services:
1.  Capability to identify, track, and cross-reference customers by all unique ""meta data"" such as name(s), address (service sites), account number(s), underlying LDC/UDC (by service zone where applicable), utility tariff and profile, etc. and to aggregate loads by these descriptions.
2.  Capability to capture and store for subsequent analysis the 12-month (or longer) billing history provided by the UDC/customer when deal is initiated.
3.  Capability to incorporate and utilize metered data and billing data into a forecasting and scheduling process for all customers (existing and potential) where physical delivery of gas or power is required or anticipated.
4.  Reported data must contain specific identification of those customers who are/will be physical and best known start and stop dates for physical service.
5.  Capability to monitor validity of forecasts on a near real-time basis by comparison with actual aggregate load(s), as estimated by pre-settlement quality data.
6.  Final settlement quality data that is as complete and accurate as possible.

It is evident that data collected by or under the control of your group is integral to accomplishing the above.  Your unique placement in the process, as interface to CSC, means that data from origination, deal sheets, dasrs, and meter ops passes through your group, directly or indirectly.  The following information, at a minimum, would seem to be key components of a process needed to provide such data needs to the Load desk:
1.  Access to live data feeds, where available, for metered data from MDMA and other systems (EDI,...).
2.  Access to alternative usage information systems such as files sent by UDCs or posted to websites.
3.  Deal sheet and DASR (or ""de-DASR"") information to anticipate changes in customers.
4.  Query and report capability to obtain routine reports, such as a weekly report on the impact on load of added/returned customers, and to obtain special reports, such as customer count or load by region, rate class, UDC, demand zone, or individual ""deal"" (like UCCSU, IBM, Sony, etc.)

In order to better develop our capabilities, the load desk has been working directly with CSC and through your group to turn that data into usable information.  We now understand that you wish to establish a single point of contact with CSC for facilitating development of customized reports or interfaces for data.  In addition, your group plans to add in-house querying and reporting capability that would augment or replace certain report needs from CSC.  I would suggest we meet and discuss again the exact form and timing of deliverables from CSC, or your group, that will be used, in turn, to underpin the systems and products needed from my group for more accurate forecasting, scheduling, and trading.  A meeting this week, while Chris Stokley could attend, would be especially helpful.

If everyone would please let me know your schedules for this week, I will arrange a meeting time and location.

My team supports the mid-back office for Gas and Power i.e. Unify, DCAF 2, TAGG Confirmations and EnPower Confirmations.  Unify is used by Gas for Logistics, Vol. Management, and Settlements.  It is used by Power for Settlements.  Unify also supports Financial Gas and Power, which is used in Houston, Calgary and London.  Confirmations are handled by DCAF 2, TAGG Confirmations or EnPower Confirmations as the case may be.

Since your teams use one or all of these applications, you share the costs.  I can meet with each of you (or your representative) individually or meet with everyone as a group.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Thanks,

Ramesh

The new products have been built and are in the process of being mapped to 
Sitara and Tagg.  I'm working with Melba Lozano (EOL contact) and she tells 
me they should be ready tomorrow.

Mark Taylor and I haven't spoken yet about simplifying the language in the 
product long description, so I'll try to get with him tomorrow.  For now, 
we're staying with the existing language which isn't really that bad.

Any of these products which are intra-month will stay in the swap filter as 
US GAS DAILY products, but longer than intra-month will be in the basis 
filter as US GAS BASIS products with the format:

  US GAS BASIS      GD/D SoCal - HHub

Accounting Regulations

Western peak power prices dropped for Saturday delivery amid waning weekend
loads, while light load prices were mostly higher due to the inclusion of
the all-day Sunday piece.  A Monday/Tuesday package will be scheduled on
Friday so WSCC traders can take off Martin Luther King Day on Monday.  While
MLK Day is not a recognized NERC holiday, it is a national holiday and a
NYMEX Exchange holiday.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures fell Thursday despite a
firmer physical market, reportedly due to bearish fundamentals and some
technical selling.  February and March Hub gas both closed at 2.254$/mmBtu,
down 14 cents and 10.9 cents, respectively.  In the political arena, White
House Spokesperson Ari Fleischer finally admitted Enron executives did meet
with President Bush and other Administration officials during the drafting
of their energy policy, but insisted that the company did not receive any
favorable treatment.  The letter to Ken Lay from Enron executive Sherron
Watkins has raised the possibility that the beleaguered company may be
forced to write-off an additional $1.3 billion in reported earnings.  The
cash in question was generated by financial subsidiaries Condor and Raptor,
which were wholly backed by Enron stock. In the wake of Andersen's auditing
debacle, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said he intends to form a new committee
responsible for oversight and regulation of the accounting industry.  In the
""too little, too late"" category, Enron's Board of Directors voted Thursday
to fire Andersen as the company's auditors.  No word yet on who the lucky
new accountants will be.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as 3.75$/MWh for
Saturday delivery, while trading in a tight range between 18 and 19$/MWh.
Light load goods, however, were flat to slightly higher, with confirmed
transactions between 17 and 18.  Some traders seemed a little surprised by
the very narrow spread between light and heavy load prices, but as one
trader pointed out, ""It's cold up here, especially for the off peak hours,
and throw in the all-day Sunday and it's no wonder why the spreads are
merging.""  There was also talk Thursday that some parties were concerned
over falling snowpack levels in the Northwest.  According to the NWRFC's
January mid-month water supply forecast, April through September runoff at
The Dalles fell to 91% of normal, down from 93% of normal on the previous
report.  Nonetheless, the report suggested the Pacific Northwest is still
likely to have much healthier water levels in 2002 than last year.  2001 was
one of the region's driest winters ever, and the January mid-month report
for that year showed April through September flows at The Dalles were only
expected to be 68% of normal.  Additionally snow-pillow data for the
Columbia Basin in Canada showed that snowpack levels are holding at
above-normal levels.  Current flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were also
holding their ground, coming in at 100 kcfs Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55
kcfs Sunday, and 100 kcfs next Monday through Thursday.

Peak electricity prices fell while off-peak prices stayed steady in the
Golden State on Thursday, mainly on the usual lighter loads for a weekend
package.  ""More heating demand from the colder weekend weather forecast also
kept light load up, and there was some generation back today, cutting into
heavy load prices"" said one California trader.  In political news, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali ruled on Thursday that he would allow
the CPUC to present arguments supporting why they should participate in the
PG&E reorganization process.  The CPUC will have until February 13 to
present their case in support of the plan they favor.  In San Francisco
Superior Court, the California Attorney General requested that Enron be held
in contempt for not turning over documents in the state's case alleging
price gouging by energy companies during last year's energy crisis.  On the
generation front, gas-fired Alamitos #3 (320 MW) returned to service on
Thursday, while sister unit #5 (480 MW) was operating at 290 MW.  Northern
hydro Big Creek Project (1,020 MW) was producing at 68% capacity, derated by
330 MW compared to just 50 MW on Wednesday.  Finally, Morro Bay #3 (337 MW)
powered up to 185 MW on its way back from a planned maintenance outage that
began January 4.  Temperatures were expected to linger below normal through
Monday of the new week.  Highs were predicted to reach the 50s at mid-state
and the low-60s at southern load centers, with corresponding lows
anticipated in the 30s and 40s, respectively.  The latest six-to-ten called
for continued below-normal conditions from January 23 to 27.

Lower weekend loads helped to depress peak power prices in the Southwest on
Thursday.  Heavy load energy costs at Palo Verde fell by as much as
4.5$/MWh, while light load goods rose by an average of 1.25$/MWh.  Off-peak
power at PV traded between 17 and 21$/MWh, with most deals going through
from 17 to 19$/MWh.  There was little to report in the way of unit news in
the desert region on Thursday.  There was some talk of a transformer check
being conducted at Palo Verde #3 (1,270 MW), but output at the nuke was
unaffected.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the
Southwest was forecast to average 113% of normal through January 24, while
the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for below-normal temperatures
in Arizona and normal temperatures in New Mexico from January 23 through 27.

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.58)  in stage that needs to

The changes were actually for Australia (wrong date/time showing, problem 
with EOL) and London (fix to default settings).
These changes should actually be invisible to Houston so you should see no 
difference between the way it was working before and now.

Please test the application (as you would normally use it) and let me know 
(by way of email or phone call) if Deal Entry is working well, and can be

Enron's Chief Denies Role As Energy Villain / Critics Regard Kenneth Lay As 
Deregulation Opportunist
Kenneth Lay is one of the energy ""pirates"" accused by California's governor 
of fleecing consumers. As chairman of Enron Corp., the world's largest energy 
trader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all. ?But 
that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like taking 
knocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energy 
mess.

out with Constellation. The way he explained it, our position is flat with 
Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the 
same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index 
offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.  But I 
suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint. 
Could you tell me exactly what needs to happen to clear this up on your end 
so that I can explain it to Bob in a way that might make him DO something? 
I'm sorry for the delay on this - I'm getting ready to call Bob's contact at 
Constellation for him.

Let me know what your ideal solution would be. Should we get Constellation to 
agree to the Dow Jones index? Or should we change the deals to forward fixed 
price? We'll fix this today - I promise.

5186," As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

We have just received an order from the California Attorney General requiring 
all employees (except legal, admin, and human resources staff) to take the 
following steps immediately:

   1.  Save all e-mails, i.e., don't delete any e-mails.
   2.  Do not delete any information in databases.
   3.  Do not delete any word processing files or file fragments.
   4.  Do not delete any excel spreadsheets or calendars or scheduling 
programs. 
   5.  Any other electronic data not otherwise covered.

This request is being made in connection with the California AG's 
investigation into electricity prices.  We do not know how many other 
companies have received a similar order, but there is no reason for us to 
assume at this time that Enron has been singled out.  

Over the next few days we will be working with our technology group to figure 
out the most efficient way to manage this request.  This is a serious matter 
and we strongly urge every person affected by this request to cooperate fully 
with this order.  We appreciate your help with this and will keep you 
apprised of any changes in policy.

5245,"How did I turn around and suddenly find myself in December? Why is there a 
man parked outside my office incessantly tooting ""Jingle Bell Rock"" on his 
horn? When will I ever see my bare feet again? How annoying is it that I 
began this e-mail with lines of whining?

I hope the holidays are at least a somewhat more sincere experience in 
Vietnam than they are here. I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in 
years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of 
the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting 
to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless 
e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, 
but that's what makes everyday interesting.

Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot. Thanksgiving was nice - 
saw a lot of friends from out of town and had enough meals with the family to 
satisfy, but not overwhelm, the quality time scale. Our office had its big 
holiday bash last weekend, which I kicked off the night before for no 
apparent reason and just continued the festivities for about 48 nonstop 
hours. There's snow on the mountain, so this weekend I might have to break in 
(or break, whichever comes first) my new snowboard.

Hope all's well on the other side of the world. It's kind of comforting to 
remind myself every once in awhile that there is another side, full of people 
who could care less about power trading and Portland, Oregon. By the way, I 
heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full. Good or bad? 
Or ugly?

Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance. I'm out of here on the 22nd, 
and it will be so nice to see the sun again. If I don't see you, have a great 
vacation, and try not to be overwhelmed by the joyousness of the season.

5249,"Hi Kate,

I spoke to Will Smith, and he told me that the best way to approach testing 
these reports, is to compare the old version of the report with the new 
version of the report using the prod database.   Please ensure that the data 
is the same, such as seeing that  the two versions list the same deals, and 
show the same volumes.  However, please keep in mind that  you may see extra 
columns in the stage version because of the  new fields we implemented:  
External Exchange ID  and External Exchange Code.  

You already have the icon for Enpower prod, (what you normally use)  but in 
order to test the stage version of the report against the prod database, you 
need to create a shortcut. Below are the directions on how to create a 
shortcut:

C:\\Enpower\Stage\AggSchVol   your_id   your_password   pwrprodn_ded

1.  Replace AggSchVol with the name of the application that you are testing.  
(Below is a list of all the reports that need to be tested)
2.  Replace your_id and your_password with your own username and password on 
the above line.
3.  Copy that above line (with CTRL-C, but don't paste it anywhere yet).
4.  Minimize all windows until you have your desktop.
5.  Right click on desktop and select New and then Shortcut from the menu.
6.  Paste line on Command line.
7.  Click Next.
8.  Click Finish.
9.  You should now have an AggSchVol.exe (or other application) icon from 
which you can get into that application.


Once again, here is a list of the reports that need to be tested:

AggSchVol    
ConCount    
CPConfirm

I have just received a copy of a press release draft for credit derivatives 
which indicates a launch date of February 23rd.

As discussed at our previous meeting, we require 2 weeks from receipt of all 
necessary international due diligence and approvals to complete the update of 
the user profiles which will be affected by credit derivatives.

As we have not yet received these approvals, the date of February 23rd is not 
possible to achieve for inclusion of credit derivatives on EnronOnline.

Also, as previously discussed, EnronOnline is a registered trademark and we 
need to approve any references which go to customers. I presume that the 
website includes such references, but I have not yet seen it. Can you forward 
the internal address and/or confirm that the website is now in its final form?

It is critical that all international due diligence be completed prior to any 
new product being introduced on EnronOnline. Mistakes are far too visible - 
we need to see documentation to show that everything is in place before any 
new products are added and before we start making changes which affect our 
customers.

As agreed, we will ensure that EnronOnline is ready for credit derivatives 
within two weeks of receiving all the necessary information and approvals. 
Please forward this information as soon as possible.

there is no  nexus between damage/loss suffered by a party and payments under

State of incorporation has been captured for a large number of the 
counterparties and has been used as the basis for the determination of 
financial trading status by our tax group.

If we are going to prevent a utility/gov/pension fund from trading financial 
products because of state law and we have state of incorporation, we should 
ensure that the entity we are barring is at least in the same state as the 
law in question.

If this has not been the case, one way to update the information would be to 
list the states which have restrictive legislation and then apply the list to 
the companies for which we have state of incorporation information. An Excel 
Vlookup would accomplish this quite quickly. This is not perfect, but would 
at least ensure that utilities in states without the legislation are not 
barred - although I recognize it might bar some companies in states where the 
legislation may be so specific as not to preclude the trading of financial 
products for some utilities under certain circumstances.

Frank: Could you please forward an updated list of state of incorporation 
information to Tana?

One last point (thanks, Bob): If a particular state has restrictive 
legislation, is it our obligation to prevent the utility from trading 
financial products, or does the obligation rest with the utility? i.e. is 
there any reason for us to be barring them, or can we simply give them the 
ability to transact financial products with EnronOnline and rely on their 
internal controls? If we don't have any legal obligation to police, I'm 
reluctant to do anything which would imply we are assuming this 
responsibility.

Mark: Can you comment on this last point?

Thanks,

> I)
> In December's edition of Under the Buzz (vol.1, no.8: ""LifeCycle-based
> Enterprise Sales: The Key to Crossing the Chasm""), I made brief references
> to sales strategies for the Early Market, while focusing attention on
> strategies for crossing the Chasm. Executives and VCs among our readers

> continue to emerge, including e-finance services, supply chain
> visibility/execution, and collaborative commerce solutions (section 4 of
> this issue). And, even companies in categories that may be starting to
> move across the chasm still need to tackle the ""big, hairy audacious
> projects"" of their visionary customers more effectively.
> Early Market Adoption Dynamics and Ten Key Traps to Avoid
> It is frequently stated that, in order to establish the value proposition
> of a new technology, the early market phase requires a simple strategy:
> ""just go get a customer"". Reinforcing this approach, our firm emphasizes
> that the core market development strategy at this point is indeed
> ""deal-driven"". So, what's the problem? If you have a sufficiently
> attractive - and discontinuous - innovation to bring to the table, surely
> it is indeed a question of ""just"" going out and closing a deal with a
> willing customer. Well, not so fast. In my own personal experience running
> software companies, I experienced significant difficulties to make this
> strategy work, and in my consulting practice I see companies flounder
> every day in early market customer engagement. Hence, success in the Early
> Market is far from being a trivial feat. Therefore, I want to examine in
> some detail the principal traps and how companies can avoid them. At least
> ten potentially critical dangers lie in wait for unsuspecting companies,
> the first five of which I shall address here:
> 1. Ignoring the key goals of Early Market sales: Companies tend to act as
> if this is a time to sell to as many customers as possible, in order to
> build a reference list that will impress later adopters. Unfortunately, by
> treating all comers as ""early adopters"", they often end up with the worst
> possible compromise: they get involved in extended sales cycles with
> mainly hesitant customers who end up requesting custom enhancements in
> return for small ""pilot"" contracts that take ages to close. In those cases
> where companies do attract a bona-fide visionary customer, they are often
> unsure how to manage the opportunity. Thus, they jump through technical
> hoops to satisfy the customer's aggressive requirements, but fail to get
> compensated for the value they deliver. Assuming for a moment that your
> company does have a valid Early Market proposition - i.e., a discontinuous
> innovation that promises to enable business in a significantly new way -
> then the main objectives are to prove (a) that the new category is indeed
> a hot one, and (b) that you are a player with leadership potential. The
> best way of achieving these goals is to find a few big company-making
> deals with visible customers who are willing to take a risk on your
> technology because they believe it can garner for them a real and dramatic
> competitive advantage. Commerce One's deal with General Motors in late
> 1999 to build an online e-procurement marketplace was a good example of
> how to do this. On the day the deal was announced, the company's stock
> price registered a significant uptick and it emerged as a leading players
> in e-procurement alongside Ariba.
> 2. Not understanding the psychographics you are dealing with: The early
> market has two distinct constituencies, each of which is quite different
> in turn from the other three (pragmatists, conservatives, and skeptics).
> While technology enthusiasts are technology-focused, visionaries are
> business-focused. More important, they are critical partners in the early
> market ""buyer alliance"" required to make anything of significance happen:
> techies need the funding provided by empowered visionaries to implement
> the new technologies in a true, industry-shaping project, while
> visionaries rely on techies to tell them whether or not the new technology
> has a chance of actually working in a live setting. Thus, while
> visionaries may not actually care two hoots about technology per se, or
> they may not really understand its intrinsic characteristics, they do have
> a keen awareness of its relevance to their business objectives.
> Unfortunately, in their anxiety to find acceptance for their ""new new
> thing"", companies confuse pragmatists with these two groups, resulting in
> missed opportunities - perhaps the worst of which is the sin of giving too
> much away for free, because visionaries are results-sensitive, but not
> price-sensitive.
> 3. Employing ineffective qualification (i.e., segmentation) criteria: Many
> companies fail to recognize that Early Market selling, in common with
> later stages in the Life Cycle, does require a segmentation strategy -
> though quite a counter-intuitive one. As a result, they spend precious
> energy selling to the wrong target customers. For example, in the Bowling
> Alley you segment for pragmatist managers in self-referencing groups (such
> as micro-niches of vertical markets), whereas in the tornado you segment
> for anyone ready to make a quick purchase decision for maximum volume, and
> on Main Street you segment for end users in selected niche markets whose
> needs and preferences you can serve effectively. In contrast, during the
> Early Market stage, when all constituencies except for the small number of
> techies and visionary executives automatically disqualify themselves from
> buying the new new thing, vendors must segment ruthlessly for visionary
> executives in visible organizations.
> 4. Asking the wrong people in your organization to find and close the
> first few deals: In most cases, assigning your entire sales force, large
> or small, to the task of finding and closing big deals with visionaries is
> asking for trouble. In order to engage with executives in such
> organizations, your best resources must be actively engaged. After all,
> these are the defining projects that will establish your company in the
> new category, so they are core for the company. The basic model for this
> in a young B2B company is an evangelistic ""sales team"" led by the CEO and
> CTO, supported wherever possible by a cadre of evangelist sales,
> technology and domain professionals. Though not entirely unlike the SWAT
> group which is appropriate for the Bowling Alley, this teaming model tends
> to be more of a virtual team, consisting of the key partners in the
> project: (i) the visionary customer, (ii) the technology company, and
> (iii) the senior service firm.
> 5. Not knowing where to find likely visionary buyers: One of the main
> problems associated with selling to techies and visionaries is that
> there's no way of telling from their business card or job title what their
> IT adoption behavior is. Worse still they tend not to congregate in herds,
> so it's difficult to find groups of them. Fortunately, however,
> visionaries tend to leave a trail - there aren't many of them and they
> usually have a track record (of sorts). While visionary individuals
> quickly make a name for themselves and (unlike company owners such as
> Michael Dell) often move from one company to another, companies stay in
> one place and, in general, they fall into one of two categories: large
> Global 2000 organizations, or fast-growing companies, often in new-ish
> industries (e.g., wireless telecommunications). One of the best ways of
> identifying them is the combined personal networks of any management team,
> as well as in publications that detail their successful and unsuccessful
> projects. After a short brainstorm session, you can usually draw up a list
> of twenty or more ""suspects"", and this is as good a place as any to start.
>
> The five points above deal mainly with understanding what the early market
> stage is really about, and how to identify and connect with visionary
> buyers. The last five dangers relate to how to successfully engage with
> bona-fide visionaries, and determine when to move to the next stage in the
> Life Cycle. Here is the complete list of ten traps, the last five (in
> bold) to be addressed later:
>
> For readers whose business is currently in the early market stage, I
> encourage you to measure your progress in avoiding the traps we have
> described here, by analyzing each significant sale closed to date, as well
> as those currently in the pipeline. If you have fallen into one of these
> traps, I strongly recommend that you debate this issue with your
> colleagues, because every mistake made here can cost you dearly. For
> readers whose business is not currently in this adoption stage, consider
> the contrast between the dynamics of the early market and the stage you
> believe your business is in. This will help you to distinguish between the
> appropriate strategies for each stage.
>
> 6. Failing to align with the visionary's goals and requirements: From the
> time you first hit it off with a true visionary buyer, you must do
> everything possible to fit in with their vision - because they always have
> a project in mind before you came along - whether it be a plan to change
> the ground-rules in their industry, gain a defensible leap in market
> share, or revolutionize some business process. Strangely enough, the worst
> possible mistake is to act like a typical product vendor, because the one
> thing that will scare them off is a vendor eager to do a deal at all
> costs. For example, agreeing to do complex custom product enhancements at
> the drop of a hat smack of desperation, and tends to make them feel that
> you may not be able to deliver what they need in the timeframe they need
> it. Remember, far from being price-sensitive, visionaries are extremely
> results-sensitive. This is because, if you think about it, their
> willingness to go where no man hath gone before makes them vulnerable if
> it should fail. Thus, visionaries need their chosen technology provider to
> do whatever it takes to make them successful. In light of this, you can
> and should count on them to be a true partner in the ""whole project"",
> along with the senior service partner who may already be a valued
> counselor to them.
> 7. Mistaking pragmatists ""in drag"" for visionaries: Pragmatists, just like
> conservatives, and even skeptics, read the same books on core competencies
> and competitive advantage as do visionaries, and they can be equally
> proficient in the lingo of strategy. Apart from any other consideration,
> talking big sounds much better than to admit right off the bat that the
> real reason they came to your seminar is, well, fear that they may be
> missing out on something important. Not -- as Seinfeld might say -- that
> there's anything wrong with being a pragmatist. It's just that, if we
> don't listen carefully, we can waste fatal amounts of time and money
> courting them, only to have a big deal forecast to close within three
> months turn into a small pilot that doesn't close for a year (or ever),
> with very little resource commitment by the customer. So, how can you tell
> immediately that you are dealing with a pragmatist rather than a
> visionary? Well, there are two guaranteed signs to probe for: (1) the
> visionary always has a project in mind that they are dying to tell you
> about, whereas the pragmatist or conservative is only there to keep tabs
> on the new stuff and make sure they don't need to do anything about it for
> the time being; (2) when your prospective customer asks ""so, who else is
> doing this?"" if they are a visionary, their expression is one of
> anticipation that they might be the first in their industry to invest in
> this new stuff, whereas pragmatists will always betray their true colors
> by the concerned look on their faces at this point. Having spotted a
> pragmatist, the best way to deal with them is to let them know that you
> understand their lack of readiness to buy at this time, and will keep them
> informed about your progress. This ""reverse psychology"" provides them with
> valuable assurance, and may even intrigue them enough to result in a pilot
> purchase- that you will not treat as a big deal warranting ""whatever it
> takes"" support.
> 8. Not charging for custom R&D or implementation services: Due to the
> plain anxiety to gain acceptance for the new innovation, companies have a
> strong tendency to want to give everything away in order to please their
> customer and thus get the contract signed quickly. Since we have said that
> visionary buyers are results-sensitive rather than price-sensitive, this
> approach can only delay the deal -- and, worse still, actually diminish
> the size of the initial commitment. In fact, the one thing that worries
> them about a vendor's eager-to-please approach in an early-market project
> negotiation is when we agree to do everything for free -- and by next
> week, into the bargain. Why would this worry them, if they stand to
> receive extra value for free? Well, put yourself in their place: if you
> have just knowingly asked your chosen vendor to develop one or two
> additional features in an still untested technology, wouldn't you worry
> just a little whether or not they can deliver something working in such a
> short time? In pure financial terms, this foolhardy attitude reduces
> dramatically the revenue received from the hard work of providing the
> requisite technology and services (usually at the cost of other key
> commitments).
> 9. Structuring each deal as a product sales rather than a ""whole project"":
> Most software companies are designed from the start to be product
> businesses, even if they know they will have to provide for plenty of
> customization to their products by engineering and/or professional
> services. Furthermore, the business model is set as a license-fee
> business, with service fees tacked on as a secondary, tactical sideline.
> This generally makes it difficult to identify and close true early-market
> opportunities effectively and profitably. The reason is that this model
> causes the vendor to focus on selling a product license, which flies
> directly in the face of the customer's goals. The clearest sign that
> vendors are approaching the early market sales opportunities incorrectly
> is that the product becomes their key point of reference; for every
> question asked by the customer, they point to benefits the product
> provides, to show how the product can solve the customer's problem --
> whatever it may be. Unfortunately for product vendors, visionary customers
> see new technologies as concepts in search of proof, rather than as
> finished products. Furthermore, they recognize that they are the only
> customers willing to commit time, resources, and money to incorporating
> the new technology into their project - assuming it is a key catalyst to
> make the project viable. However, the more the vendor sets out to prove
> that the product does everything the customer needs, the more they get
> into hot water, via repeated demos; the customer sends different teams to
> see the latest custom demo that doesn't quite do everything the customer
> dreams of, the company then has to do unnatural acts by the following week
> in order to recover the lost ground with a demo that actually works, by
> which time the customer has become concerned that the vendor is not really
> listening to their requests, but just trying to sell them something.
> The only solution to this problem during this stage is for the vendor to
> think like a service company, evaluating every valid opportunity as a
> project, rather than a product sale. Engineering and implementation
> resources should be allocated a priori to these projects, the best and
> most senior talent needs to be allocated to co-managing the project and
> ensuring follow-through, contracts should be structured on a risk-reward
> basis, and every piece of value-adding work should be charged for (large
> companies understand that you are not a registered charity). By and large,
> deal structure should emulate the structure of large technology
> integration projects: the customer should commit to (a) a significant cash
> payment up-front to fund start-up resources, then (b) milestone payments
> for each key project phase, and (c) a final payment for project completion
> and full rollout. Customers need to know that the vendor is committed to
> their success, so pricing and fees must reflect this emphasis. Remember,
> they are results-sensitive, so that whenever they are not charged for work
> that they consider critical, they will become concerned about on-time
> delivery of a working solution. There is only one exception to this
> pricing guideline: work performed to make good on basic, existing
> functionality should be funded by technology vendor, as a basic part of
> their contractual obligation.
> 10. Failing to see know when/how to move to the next stage: Unfortunately,
> a year or two into the Early Market stage, there is no Gartner Group or
> Forrester report to let you know for sure that it's time to change
> strategies and negotiate the delicate but vital leap across the Chasm. In
> fact, the only reliable indications that you have reached the end of this
> big-project stage are two-fold: (1) no new visionaries -- all of the
> visionaries that could have been attracted to your technology have already
> made their commitments (and these customers are now anxiously waiting to
> for their project to be completed), and (2) pragmatists are still wary of
> making any more than a token toe-in-the-water commitment to a pilot
> project. Now, if you've been reasonably successful during this stage, you
> probably have between three and seven live projects at various stages of
> completion, and a number of pilots in place with the pragmatists you
> managed to eke out a deal with. But, still, it's not easy to know that
> it's time to cross the chasm. What's left to do is review each significant
> project in detail, to see what competitive advantage benefits your

5328,"Mark Haedicke, Greg Whalley and I will be meeting with several people at the 
NYMEX on Friday morning.  It's possible (although not likely) that Dan 
Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.  I remember that we were very 
unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that 
message to the NYMEX a couple of times.  What I'm not sure of is whether 
their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.  Are you aware 
of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not 
our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?  I'm just 
wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if 
Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.

I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC 
currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner 
Newsome tomorrow.  It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the 
calendar, though.  Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall 
background noise of a big ISDA meeting.  Maybe I can come up alone and we can 
do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo 
time in the Commissioner's face.  What do you think?","Mark Haedicke Greg Whalley Dan

5329,"I am writing in regards to ISDA's Energy and Developing Products conference
in London on December 4, 2001.  I have attached a draft agenda for your
review.  In order to finalize the agenda, please advise on the following
issues:

- New and Developing Products in Europe
- Local public policy issues in Europe
- Product types that are of interest to Europe

 <<draft2.doc>>
At the last Energy and Developing Products conference held in Houston in
March 2001, we had problems finding suitable speakers willing to participate
in conference.  Keep in mind we had twenty two speakers for a one day
conference!!  As a result, we would prefer to have fewer workshops this time
in London.  Workshop 1 in each session we will provide global and regional
perspectives on different product types with a focus on business and trading
issues.  Workshop 2 is for attendees who are interested in a more in-depth
understanding of the ISDA Master Agreement and how it can be used to
document energy and power derivatives.  This workshop will be repeated in
session two.  Please note, Houston's conference had one more workshop in
session one and session two.  Please suggest workshop topics that would be
of interest to delegates attending the conference.

I look forward to hearing from you.

5332,"Mark and Frank, in addition to the emails I sent to Frank about Devon and mark about PPL, here is a summary of the where we stand on some of the hot ISDA negotiations and what, if anything, needs to be done right away.

PPL Energy-- the schedule was negotiated.  Darren V. in credit and I were working to correct some errors and issues re: the guaranty.  Darren can discuss.  This is the ISDa that is ready to move and should move.  Mark, I think I forwarded to you the lastest emails from this week from Darren.  But in any case, if another lawyer can check this file and call Darren if they have any questions, he would be quick to get back to that persona and get them up to speed.

Devon - Frank and I spoke about Devon today.  The counterparty had put the file on file because Devon was too busy focusing on the acquisition of Mitchell Energy (the company built by the guy who also built the Woodlands).  Now, Devon is ready to move forward and requested a blackline.  Jason has asked that we hold off until he can review credit issues in light of the acquisition.

Welch's -- Jason Williams and I have worked on this one very closely and Jason has attended every conference call with me.  We have gone back and fault on the thresholds and Jason sent some new ones, I faxed them to the counterparty and we have not heard back from them.  I emailed Jason today to ask him to please follow-ip to ask about the thresholds. Otherwise, we have updated blacklines in the file.  I have asked several swap attorneys about questions before I moved forward but Sara has been the second point person.  Check with Jason to see if the attorney follows up -- she might be on vacation.  Keegan also has the phone number of the attorney's assistant who knows how to reach her when she is out of the office on a part time (or summer) schedule).

5334,"1.  Attached to the forwarded e-mail below please find a link to the demo for 
the Five Flags Game.  Please note that this is still a work in progress.  We 
still need to prepare the ""How to Play"" section, for example.  Let me assure 
you that this Section and no other section in the game will include the term 
""Olympics"" or any of the other protected terms that we have been advised to 
avoid from the various jurisdictions.  The front page of the game will 
include an express disclaimer to the effect of the following:  ""The Enron 
Five Flags Down Under game has not been set up in collaboration with any 
parties, other than Internet Sports Network, Inc.""

2.  I have attached a draft of the Official Rules for your review. The front 
page of the game will make clear that by electing to play the game, a 
participant acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the Official Rules.  
Please note that the rules make clear that only residents of certain 
specified jurisdictions are entitled to play.  The rules spell out that 
residents of Japan are entitled to play but are not eligible to receive 
prizes in excess of 100,000 yen.  Anne, please confirm that it is permissible 
for us to allow Japanese residence to play and to merely limit their 
eligibility for prize awards.  (There will be prizes available that are 
valued at approx. $5000-$10,000 USD, but if a Japanese resident won the grand 
prize, he/she would not be awarded such a prize.  Instead, in such a 
circumstance, a Japanese winner probably would be awarded one of the 
consolation prizes instead.)



3.  The game will not be promoted with fliers or other hard-copy marketing 
materials, after all.  Instead, the game will be promoted on the 
password-protected Trading Screen of EnronOnline.  (The game will NOT be 
promoted on the home page.)  All registered users of EnronOnline will be able 
to see the front page of the game, including residents of Canada, Australia, 
and any European country where participation in the game is prohibited.  

4.  The following disclaimer will be included (1) next to the initial 
hyperlink to the game on the EnronOnline website (to confirm that this is 
possible; (2) on the front page of the game; and (3) on the registration 
page.  ""This game is only available to residents of A, B and C.  Furthermore, 
due to the operation of the law in Japan, we will be unable to award prizes 
whose value exceeds 100,000 Yen to Japanese residents.""  The registration 
page will include a gating function that requires the participant to enter 
his/her country of residence or principal place of business.  PLEASE ADVISE 
AS TO NECESSARY FORM OF QUESTION -- e.g., country of residence vs. country 
where business with Enron is conducted  If the country selected is not an 
eligible jurisdiction, the participant will receive a message that he/she is 
ineligible to play the game due to regulatory restrictions in his/her country 
of residence and will not be able to play the game.

Rachel and Marly:  I need to finalize the list of eligible jurisdictions as 
soon as possible.  Here's what I have so far:

USA, excluding NY and Florida (Milbank is advising on US issues)
UK
Germany
Switzerland
Poland 
Austria.

I thought that Portugal was also in the ""approved"" category.  Please advise 
as to the status of Portugal, as well as other jurisdictions where we are 
awaiting approval.  If the demo is not sufficiently complete to facilitate 
the approval process, please notify Dave Samuels so that he can work with the 
developer to create a more substantially complete demo.

5.  From the Canadian and Australian perspective, I merely want to confirm 
that our disclaimer in (4) above is sufficient to protect Enron from 
liability in Canada and Australia, as applicable, to gaming laws.

I will be in the office through the morning of Tuesday, Aug. 29.  Thereafter, 
through September 9, I will be on vacation.  Mark Taylor will be finalizaing

5360,"Last February (2001) House Bill 284 was proposed in the New
Hampshire legislature.  The bill was one of the most progressive
multipollutant plans to be proposed in the U.S. and the only one
with specific reduction requirements for all four pollutants (SO2,
NOx, mercury and CO2).  Since then officials, interest groups
and energy industry representatives have been negotiating to
modify the bill so that all parties involved could support the
legislation.  November 6, 2001 the new draft of HB 284 was
released.  A summary of the bill and significant changes from the
February draft follow.

The bill is applicable to existing fossil fuel power plants.  New
Hampshire has 3 grandfathered power plants built before 1977:
Merrimack Station in Bow, Schiller Station in Portsmouth, and
Newington Station in Newington; all three belong to Public
Service of New Hampshire (PSNH).  This bill is specifically
aimed at controlling emissions from these plants, however the
language of the bill is somewhat vague and could include other
existing units.  We are waiting for a response from the state on
this issue.

The new caps will be applied year round.  Allowances are
output-based and trading is allowed for SO2, NOx, and CO2.
The rule language also allows for trading of mercury, however
the supplementary information does not list mercury as a
tradable pollutant.  We are looking into this.   Caps are as
follows:

*   SO2 emissions: 7,289 tpy.  This is a 75% reduction from
    current levels by the end of 2006.  This is the same cap
    as the original bill, but achieved a year earlier.
*   NOx emissions: 3,644 tpy.  This is a 70% reduction from
    current levels by the end of 2006.  This too is the same
    cap as the original bill, and it will also be achieved a year
    sooner.
*   CO2 emissions: 5,425,866 tpy.  This reduction will put
    emissions at 1990 levels by 2010.  This change aligns
    the target and timetable for carbon reductions with those
    of the New England Governors and Eastern Canadian
    Premiers Climate Change Action Plan, adopted in
    August 2001.  A lower cap for years after 2010 will be
    recommended no later then April 2004.
*   A cap for mercury emissions from coal burning plants must
    be recommended to the Legislature by the Department
    of Environmental Services by early 2004.  This schedule
    allows the cap to be set taking into account a specific
    assessment of mercury emissions from PSNH's facilities
    and the results of federal mercury limits that will be
    proposed by the US EPA in late 2003.

Affected units must file compliance plans to meet the
requirements of the new bill and to describe monitoring and
reporting procedures for mercury content in emissions.  Caps
may be met through reductions or trading.  Allowances from
federal and regional trading programs may be used as well,
however mercury credits from other programs are only valid for
reductions above the level required by federal limits.  An SO2
allowance from an upwind state will be upgraded by 25%,
meaning 0.8 tons purchased from an upwind state will be
credited as 1.0 allowances by the state.  NOx DERCs cannot
be used for compliance from May to September.  Credit will be
given for early reductions of CO2 and Mercury.

Voluntary expenditures by PSNH for energy efficiency,
renewable energy, and conservation programs will be rewarded
by a number of allowances equivalent to the cost of the
renewable, efficiency and conservation programs.

The bill will be introduced as an amendment to HB 284, which
was retained from the 2001 Legislative Session.  Action on the
bill early in the 2002 Legislative Session, which starts in January,
is anticipated.

Mike -

I work with Mark Taylor's group and support both EOL and Clickpaper.com on 
numerous matters.  Prior to this, I worked with Peter del Vecchio in the pulp 
and paper area. 

Peter indicated that there was a possible deal being looked at with Itochu 
whereby there would be a ""regional"" Clickpaper.com established in Japan to 
assist Itochu in electronically servicing its pulp and paper clients.  My 
question to Peter was what software is being proposed to support the deal and 
under what licensing arrangement.

My understanding is that a software product provided by Ariba Inc. is used to 
support/power Clickpaper.com.  I was previously asked to review the Ariba 
software license in relation to Clickpaper.com's ability to establish 
""regional"" Clickpaper.com systems.  The conclusions reached from this review 
were that (1) there are some restrictions on Enron's ability to use the 
software for more than the two sites for which the license was originally 
obtained (the ""regional"" sites being considered separate sites) and (2) that 
an assignment of the Enron rights is possible to an affiliate (presuming some 
level of Enron equity ownership); however, Enron would remain liable for the 
use (i.e., license fees and maintenance fees) and misuse of the software.  

If the Ariba software is the ""Clickpaper software"" supporting the proposed 
Itochu software license from Clickpaper.com/Enron, I would like to further 
explore the exact manner in which this license is being proposed and whether 
or not communications with Ariba have been undertaken to ensure this will not 
violate our existing software license.

If the ""Clickpaper software"" is not associated with the Ariba software (and 
its license), the analysis of the Ariba software license that I performed is 
not applicable.  However, if the ""Clickpaper software"" involves third party 
software and Enron's software license has not been reviewed, an analysis of

This is the note I prepared for external counsel regarding the proposed new 
third party prices functionality for EOL .  Hope this accords with your 
understanding.  Incidentally, on what basis did we get round the CFTC 
rules..?..this might help me in any discussions with the SFA, given that it 
does raise regulatory issues

Hope all's well with you...

5390,"Ian, thanks for the e-mail and phone call.  I have checked around the office 
here in order to come up with a plan for most effeciently addressing your 
queries.  As I mentioned to you, I have been working closely with Jan 
Haizman, based in London, and Mike Grimes, based in Tokyo, in looking at the 
regulatory issues associated with off-line trading in Japan.  Jan and Mike 
have made substantial progress in identifying and developing plans to address 
those issues.  I will leave it to Jan and Mike to comment, but it makes sense 
to me that pggy back on those efforts with respect to EOL. 

Cynthia Harkness of our office here has been working with the EOL group, 
including I believe Mark Taylor, with respect to developing the Ts & Cs for 
the EOL broadband offering.  I will, with Cynthia, hook Mark up with the 
on-going regulatory effort, and determine what help, if any, Mark needs with 
respect to developing an EOL offering for Japan.  As I understand it, you 
want us to advise you on how EOL can offer broadband in Japan (by reviewing 
and updating earlier due dikligence on this matter) . Please let me know if I 
misunderstand the nature of your request for assistance in this regard.  To 
the extent that we need the advice of  outside counsel, can I assume wea are 
authorized to instruct them on your behalf?  Let me know your thoughts on 
costs.

Paul Archietzel spoke today.  Mr. Archietzel is with the CFTC's Division of 
Economic Analysis and (Bill believes) is very involved in rule drafting and 
promulgation.

According to Bill, Mr. Archietzel stated in his speech that he believes it 
was no accident that Congress referred to ""agricultural commodities"" (rather 
than the enumerated grains and meats) in the CFMA when establishing which 
commodities will continue to be subject to full regulation.  Mr. Archietzel 
also expressly stated that there is at least a possibility that pulp and 
paper would be considered ""agricultural commodities"" as used in the CFMA.

Obviously, then, the upcoming rulemaking process could be of critical 
importance to our pulp and paper business as well as our agriculture 
business. We will clearly need to monitor the process very closely, and 
strongly consider getting involved in the comment process.

Could you address the following questions?

1) Do you have a redlined version of the GTC, highlighting changes from what 
is online?
2) You mention: ""Counterparties from other countries will require specific 
tax clearance"" - could you explain what this process will be?
3) Could you please confirm that Australia does not have a Double Taxation 
Agreement with:

 Argentina
 Brazil
 Canada
 Croatia
 Germany
 Japan
 Netherlands
 Poland
 Portugal
 Romania
 Singapore
 Slovenia
(note these are all countries which have PA's under EnronOnline or are 
expected to have PA's very soon)

4) 1.5: Reasonableness Test: ""a determination needs to be made whether 
inviting them to trade Australian Power could lead to a claim of 
misleading/deceptive conduct under the Trade Practices Act 1974.""  Can you 
make this determination or indicate how we can make this determination?

5) 1.2 Regulatory Obligations: ""Confirm that counterparty will trade as 
principal."" In your opinion,does Clause 2(a) of the ETA sufficiently address 
this concern?

reflected in the confirmations.

Compliance with U.S. Laws We've added the buyer/seller trade sanctions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

functional group who will be supporting this critical project.  In those 
discussions, I have found that the members are coming from different levels 
of knowledge of this project.  It is my intention to bring everybody up to 
speed at the same knowledge base.  I would like to meet with you on Tuesday, 
June 1, from 10 - 11:30 a.m.  Conference room EB-32c2 has been reserved for 
this meeting.  Please let me know if you will or will not be able to attend 
this meeting.

After our one on one discussions, I forwarded to each of you all of the data 
that I have received to date from London.  I recommend that you review this 
documentation prior to our meeting on Tuesday, June 1.  I have also included 
David Port's latest ""Operational Policy and Procedures"" file which supersedes 
what I previously sent to you regarding this section only.




Also attached is the on-line trading project team member list from the London 
and Houston based operations within each respective function.  This list 
includes the groups that they will be representing, telephone numbers, and 
locations.  Please review this list for corrections and updates, and give me 
these changes.  I will update the list and forward the revised copy to you.  
If I have missed anyone, it has not been intentional, and I apologize.




Paul Racicot, Andy Thomas and I met on Wednesday, May 26, with Jay Webb and 
his IT team to start detailed discussion around company profile, customer 
profile, and trader profile.  A number of ""to do"" items came out of this 
meeting; I have started working on these items as follows:

Customer Profile  We are in the process of pulling our ""mission"" critical 
counterparties by product.  This will be based on each products' top 
counterparties within the 1998 business year.  Each product list has a 
different scope to narrow the number, thus helping focus on those critical 
counterparties.  The lists will be given to Paul Racicot who will distribute 
to the appropriate commercial heads in Houston to identify which 
counterparties listed and/or additions/deletions for first phase 
implementation.  After these short lists have been agreed upon, the 
counterparty information will go to our credit and legal groups for due 
diligence to assure that everything is appropriate for phase one 
implementation.

Customer Profile - General Terms and Conditions   Another outcome from this 
meeting dealt with the general terms and conditions [GTC] and how they will 
relate to each of the specific counterparties.

Customer Profile - Field Descriptions 
I am also co-ordinating with the legal group for their review and comment on 
the wording of the ""short"" and ""long"" description within the company profile 
screen.

David Port will be in Houston next week.  David and I will meet to develop 
the following:

specific work schedules by discipline which will include key activities, 
individuals, and critical timing required to meet phase one for the project 
deadline
confirm that the system can do what we imply it should do in this process
confirm that it is workable for US traded products
fill in any gaps between locations, product business, etc.
agree the method of roll - out to business units because it needs their 
cooperation
decide and address resource implications

I thank all of you for your participation in this project and sharing your 
knowledge and time to bring this project to a successful completion.  I look 
forward to our meeting on Tuesday.

Entities will be essentially the same for the website as for Enron Online.  
It is possible, given the tight timing, that some ""finishing touches"" needed 
to be put to this process after the launch of the website.  Also, Legal will 
be producing formalising the procedure (most likely by means of a checklist) 
to assist the lawyer/paralegal charged with performing the legal approval 
process. 

Also, please note that the process in London and Houston for approving 
Reference Credits is essentially the same - any difference merely reflects 
the more developed/diverse nature of the businesses in Houston and the fact 
that there are a number of General Counsels there who need to sign off, while 
there is only one in London.

Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day).
 
I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon.
 
I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January.
 
I am confident that things will run smoother in the future.

Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) has announced that it has suspended its open season for additional intrastate pipeline capacity that was scheduled to close Aug. 30. The California utility said it made the decision not to go forward with the open season at this time while conducting a corporate wide review related to its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. 
PG&E emphasized that the open season was being deferred, not canceled, and that shippers would have a minimum of 30 days to prepare bids for service when it resumed. 
""I don't want to say that we were premature in beginning the open season,"" said PG&E spokeswoman Christy Dennis, who noted that the company simply ""has pulled back for the moment"" due to the ""huge reorganization process"" related to the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Shippers shouldn't view this as a ""huge red flag"" on the project. 
Dennis could not cite a specific date when the open season would resume, but she said ""it should be reinstituted within the next few months."" Shippers will be notified then, she noted. 
The utility first announced the open season in late May, saying that it planned to offer more than 1.2 Bcf/d of backbone capacity on the Redwood, Baja and Silverado paths on which gas from Malin, OR; Topock, AZ, and California in-state gas production is delivered to PG&E's local transmission system and other pipelines. Included in the open season was an anticipated 200 MMcf/d expansion of the Redwood path from Malin. 
The open season initially was to have closed on July 31, but PG&E extended it until Aug. 30. The utility, which currently transports more than 3 Bcf/d of gas in central and northern California, projected that the additional in-state pipeline capacity would be in service by Jan. 1, 2003, but the open season suspension could very well push back the date.

We have a case before the Nevada PUC where SW Gas is trying to force transportation customers who return to sales service to sign up for a minimum term of 5 years and then to give one year's notice before they can return to transportation.  Some customers went back to sales because of delivery and pricing problems last winter, so it became an issue (although most of those customers only had to sign up for 1 year of sales).",,,ENA the Nevada PUC
5447,"

Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read ""30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month"".  

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words ""or interruptible"" should be deleted from this provision.  The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term ""letter"" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay.  
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension is 52722.

about what has been transpiring  with PD.  He recently met with Ariz. Elect. 
Power Coop, (AEPCO) who floated the idea of Enron selling them fixed price 
power at Palo Verde and AEPCO selling phyiscal to meet PD needs after the 
AEPCO contract with PD expires.  

We got Joe Robertson on the telephone who indicated you are meeting with PD 
perhaps today.

As we have discussed, our strategy is to not call PD and allow you guys to 
work your magic and let us know when you need assistance on gas or energy 
pricing or physical delivery.
 
Can you give us an update of your efforts so far?  Is there anything that we

For the May invoice, we need to subtract this amount from usage.  Enter the volume into the area where we show transportation by others to the citygate.  This is logical as we otherwise would have to transport this gas in ourselves.

After this trade, the TA imbalance on 97ZH will be 30,688 MMBtu.  ENA is responsible for this imbalance.  It is my understanding that future imbalances will go to the 97ZH OBA rather than the TA.  Therefore, this current TA imbalance will be there until it is eliminated.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

Mackenzie Delta Natural Gas Project Files for Approval

  

   A consortium of major oil companies have moved closer to 

developing almost 6 Tcf of natural gas in the Mackenzie Delta region 

on the coast of the Beaufort Sea. The group has begun the lengthy 

process of applying for regulatory approval, which could take up to 4 

years. Led by Imperial Oil, the group consists of Conoco, Shell 

Canada, Exxon Mobil and now includes a company controlled by 

Northwest Territories native people. The partners, known as the 

Mackenzie Valley Producers Group, could spend up to C$250 million 

before they decide whether to proceed with the project. The natural 

gas reserves would be produced from Imperial's 3 Tcf Taglu field, the 

1.8 Tcf Parsons Lake field, owned by Conoco and Exxon Mobil, and 

Shell's 1 Tcf Niglintgak field. The project would include a pipeline 

to carry up to 1 Bcf per day of natural gas to Alberta along the 

Mackenzie River valley at a estimated cost of C$3 billion. The 

natural gas would then be transported to Canada and the US. Last 

year, the group signed an agreement with Northwest Territories native 

leaders that would give the region's people a 33% share in the 

pipeline and provide other economic benefits. Even if the Mackenzie 

Delta project did not start pumping for 5 or 6 years, it likely will 

still be ahead of the Alaskan project, where BP, Exxon Mobil and 

Phillips are planning development of their reserves.
