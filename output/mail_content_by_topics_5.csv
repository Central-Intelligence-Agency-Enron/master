Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.",,,LJM the Securities and Exchange Commission

facilitate these meetings, and do so in such a ""tone"" that Jim doesn't react 
the way I sense he did,  so I'll be coming to you to discuss, OK?

A couple things about the limit orders:

1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open 
should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.  
Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.  
Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading 
session unless specified otherwise.  

2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.  
When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 
increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the 
quantity to be 15,000.  

3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system 
saying error trade, price not available.

4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, 
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a 
valuable feature.

Thx,
John",Dave Pete,,

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.

over 24 hours we have collected 100,000 signed letters
to Al Gore urging him to concede. But let's not stop
there!

We need to put more pressure on Al Gore. Below is an
e-mail that can forwarded to all of your friends and
relatives -- anyone who is interested in preserving
the integrity of this election.

Spread the Word!

============================================================

Dear Friend,

Al Gore is flatly refusing to accept the fair and just
election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a calculated
course of action intended to overturn the will of the voters
and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in these
actions are his attempts to attack and discredit military
absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while simultaneously
using manipulative ""hand-counting"" techniques to convert
so-called ""dimpled chads"" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers
an overwhelming majority of American citizens.

In order to make this point clear to Mr. Gore, Election
Integrity 2000 is collecting online letters to send to Al
Gore urging him to concede the election NOW!

Please go to http://www.electionintegrity.com/home/g349.cfm
 to sign your letter to Al Gore right now.

Al Gore always claims to be ""listening to the will of the
people.""  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

PLEASE forward this urgent e-mail to every friend who might
be interested in sending a message to Al Gore that America
wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

172,"Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Jake Plummer (Ari) should get the start although he is still
hurting a tad with thumb and rib injuries.  He is listed as probable
on the injury report.  His backup Dave Brown is questionable with a
shoulder injury.

QB Doug Johnson (Atl) has been named the starter for the rest of the
season.

QB Trent Dilfer (Bal) is on a bye this week.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is expected to start with sore ribs.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is making excellent progress, but he will likely
miss again this week.  Shane Matthews is expected to get the start
this week.  Cade is listed as questionable with a sore shoulder.  He
would probably play if Matthews were to get hurt.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) is expected to return as the starter despite
a sore knee.  He practiced on Wednesday.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) did not throw on Wednesday as he nurses his
ribs.  The team has not yet named a starter and if he can not go will
look to Spergon Wynn to lead there team into the slaughter.  Either
way, look for Jacksonville's defense to look good in this contest.

QB Clint Stoerner was signed by Dallas this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) is slated to return the last week of the NFL
season at the earliest.  Gus Frerotte will start in his absence.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) was able to practice Tuesday and is expected
to take the field with his sore ribs.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) practiced on Wednesday, but is still questionable
whether he will start.  The coaching staff has yet to name a
starter.  I rate his chances at 85% to start.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) was able to practice Wednesday and now looks
like he will start this Sunday.  He is listed as questionable on the
injury report with a sore shoulder and neck.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding.  He appears as
questionable on the injury report again with a  sore thumb and a
bruised ego.  He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays
hurt.  If he can not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100%
knee) to take the field.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar
play.   He starts again this week.

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) is probable with a sore calf, but expects to
start.

QB Jerome Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more
than that to keep him off the field.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or two for a
more durable body.  He appears on the injured list again as
questionable with a sore knee.  Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin,
will start again in his place.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for the injured Brock
Huard.  Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney and was just
released from the hospital earlier this week.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in
practice.  He will start this week.  Trent Green will back him up.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start against
the Cowboys.  Eric Zeier would play if Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start this
week.  He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a hurt
thumb.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind center while Jeff George
watches.  I doubt we have seen the last of this controversy.

////////////////////////////////

Running backs in the News:

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is gone for the season.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to practice briefly on Wednesday and
is questionable for this week's game.  He is having trouble
making the hard cuts so will likely be ineffective even if he plays.

RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game.

RB Tim Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He
is listed as probable with a sore toe.

RB Jamel White (Cle) is banged up with a sore shoulder.  Look for
Travis Prentice to ""shoulder"" more of the load this week.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) has shaken off the concussion and will start
this week.

RB Terrell Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems.  Mike
Anderson gets the start again this week.

RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his sore thumb.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game.  Ahman Green will get
the start.

RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to be the
starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury report
with a tender hamstring.

RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is probable with a sore hamstring.

RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as questionable on the injury report with
bruised ribs, but he expects to play.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) is healing way ahead of schedule.  He may now
be ready for the last game of the regular season.  His cast is
expected to come off later this week.

RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as questionable on the injury report
with a sore neck.  He is still expected to start though, but Chad
Morton may see a few more reps than usual.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain.  He is
listed as probable with a sore gluteous.  I am guessing he is the
butt of many New York jokes.

RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will return punts.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and finger,
but his ankles are better.  He will play this week.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this week and he is using
the time to look for personalized items with his last name.  We will
keep you posted.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as questionable with a sore hamstring.
On a team that already has a crowded backfield with Jermaine Fazande
and Terrell Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could be placed on the
inactive list this week.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) has a broken rib, but is expected to play
with the pain.

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed as questionable on the injury
report, but is doubtful he would have played anyway.  The team
remains cautious in his comeback.

RB Mike Alstott (TB) will not play this week.  Look for Warrick Dunn
to get plenty of opportunities against a soft Dallas defense.

RB Eddie George (Ten) skipped Wednesday's practice, but expects
to practice today and play this weekend.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as questionable with a sore knee.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his sore forearm.  Look for the
Giants to attempt to arm-tackle him all day.

///////////////////////////////////

Wide Receivers in the News:

WR Frank Sanders (Ari) is expected to play with a sore leg.

WR Brian Finneran (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to
play with a sore back.

WR Qadry Ismail (Bal) is on a bye this week.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) will use this week to heal his shoulder he
injured in last week's game.

WR Peerless Price (Buf) is expected to play with a sore ankle.

WR Donald Hayes (Car) is expected to start with a sore groin.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as questionable with a sore
knee.  He did not practice on Wednesday.

WR Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week.  Johnnie Morton and
Herman Moore will start in his absence.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more time on the injury report than
Yancey Thigpen=01(=01(=01(well maybe not, but he can't stay healthy
either.
Corey misses another game this week as he is officially listed as out.

WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and is listed as
questionable on the injury report.  He says he will be ready to play
though.

WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable with a sore toe.  With Tony
Martin now healthy, the team will likely rest OJ so that he can heal
for the playoffs.

WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as questionable on the injury report
with a sore leg, but he expects to play.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than his listing on the
injury report.  Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing good enough
to hold onto the starting jobs even if Jake were to get healthy.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum.  Joe Jurevicius
will start in his place.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start over Laveranues Coles who is out
with a twisted knee.

WR Courtney Hawkins (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee,
but even if he played he would likely be ineffective.  Hines Ward has
been the only Pittsburgh receiver to do anything consistently all
year.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to play, but he keeps talking
like he will be on the field though.  He was quoted in the Sacramento
Bee as saying he is 85% right now.  I am guessing he is closer to
70%, but he probably will play if he can handle the pain from his
turf toe.

WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury.

WR Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this
week.

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring.
Even if he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor.

WR Albert Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his
condition.  He remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to
whether he plays.  The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar
so he may have limited value even if he suits up this week.

WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh, but is expected to play
this week.

///////////////////////////////

Tight Ends in the News:

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to play
with a sore knee.

TE Shannon Sharpe (Bal) is on a bye this week.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is bothered by a sore knee.  Fantasy players are
bothered that he is still mentioned as a player in the NFL.

TE Aaron Shea (Cle) is listed as questionable with sore quadriceps.
He was limited in practice, but expects to play in the game.

TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this
weekend.  He is expected to practice on Thursday and is listed as
questionable on the injury report with a sore knee.

TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and just did not catch a pass
last week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon.  If Grbac plays, expect
him to get the ball to Tony again.

TE Hunter Goodwin (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to
play.

TE Johnny McWilliams (Min) is now the starter.  John Davis still gets
a lot of looks though.

TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow.

///////////////////////////////

Kickers in the News:

PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week.  But he has
looked like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall
minutes before game-time.  Now that the Rams are tied for first
though, expect the players to start working through the pain.  I rate
Wilkins chance to start at close to 90% this week.

180,"Dear Eric,

We scored a major victory for election integrity this past
Sunday when Florida certified the election results in George
W. Bush's favor.  I want to thank you for being one of the
325,000 plus Americans who joined the petition campaign at
ElectionIntegrity2000.com to ""Certify the Bush
Victory.""

Unfortunately, Al Gore has flatly refused to accept the fair
and just election results.  Instead, he is pursuing a
calculated course of action intended to overturn the will of
the voters and the CERTIFIED election results.  Included in
these actions are his attempts to attack and discredit
military absentee votes cast for George W. Bush while
simultaneously using manipulative ""hand-counting"" techniques
to convert so-called ""dimpled chads"" into votes for Gore.

This is not fair, it is not right, and the American people
won't be fooled by the attack dogs and spin-doctors sent by
Al Gore to crowd the airwaves on his behalf.

What Gore is doing is WRONG.  And every day that he continues
to contest this election -- whether it be in the courts or in
the media or anywhere else -- further frustrates and angers a
clear majority of American citizens.

That's why Election Integrity 2000 has started up a new
campaign to collect online letters and send them to Al Gore
urging him to concede the election NOW!

Al Gore always claims to be ""listening to the will of the
people.""  The fact is, WE are the people, and he is about to
hear from us in a big way.

But just in case this isn't enough, we'll also be sending daily
press releases to the leaders in the House and Senate as well
as the major news media informing them about the overwhelming
response we are receiving from American people demanding that
Al Gore concede.

Eric, this is a personalized message just for you.
Please go to the link at the bottom of this message to sign your
letter to Al Gore.

Do NOT forward this e-mail.

In the couple of hours, I'll send you another e-mail for you
to forward to every friend who might be interested in sending a
message to Al Gore that America wants him to concede.

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle

TALKING POINTS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT

MYTH:  There are more than 10,000 votes in Miami-Dade that have
never been counted.

BOIES:  ""[T]here are over 10,000 ballots that have never been
counted once for the presidency of the United States.""  [Today
Show, 11/27/00]

FACT:
~ Every ballot in Miami-Dade was counted at least twice - once
  on election night and again during the automatic recount.

~ In every election, there are a significant number of ballots
  that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in
  every race on the ballot, including races for President.

~ For example, in this election, 5% of the voters in Idaho,
  3.9% of the voters in Illinois and 3.6% of the voters in
  Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President.

~ The 10,000 votes (actually 9,000 according to their filing)
  about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute
  only 1.6% of the ballots cast in Miami-Dade.  These ballots
  were counted - twice; they merely registered no vote for
  President.

~ This reality reflects common sense:  a voter may want to vote
  for a candidate for the Senate, House or other office, but be
  undecided about the choice for President.  In particular, a
  voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may
  vote for local or statewide candidates, but be uncomfortable
  with his or her party's choice for President and yet
  unwilling to vote for the other party's candidate.  So he or
  she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for
  President.


MYTH: If you counted all the votes that already have been
counted in some of the recount, Gore would actually be ahead
by 9 votes.

FACT:
~ Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and
  unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach
  and from the partial manual recount from Miami-Dade, and by
  subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of
  the certified votes from Nassau County.

~ The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Sunday
  for completing manual recounts, almost tripling the statutory
  time period for counting mandated by Florida's Legislature.

~ Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme
  Court's deadline.

~ Miami-Dade returned to its original decision of not
  proceeding with a manual recount.

~ The 157 ""interim gain"" for Gore in Miami-Dade came from a
  selective recount of the most Democrat precincts.  Gore won
  these selected precincts by approximately 75% to 25%, while
  Gore won the entire county only by 53% to 46%.  It would be
  unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican
  precincts, too.  Precincts in Miami-Dade, including those
  with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters,
  favored Bush.  The Gore approach would treat these minorities
  in a discriminatory fashion.

~ Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and
  federal law should be counted.  Counties recognized this and
  counted them.  Even Joe Lieberman said that such military
  ballots should not be rejected.


MYTH:  Miami-Dade would have conducted a manual recount if not
for the Republican ""mob"" that ""intimidated"" the canvassing board.

   KLAIN:  ""We think already almost 160 votes were counted in
   Dade County before the mob stopped the count...  But I think
   that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility, stop a
   count, and then that's going to provide the end because a
   partisan of the Bush campaign, Ms. Harris, refuses to accept
   returns and cuts off the counting, I don't think that's the
   kind of end that we have to American elections.""
   [Good Morning America, ABC, 11/27/00]

FACT:
~ The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Board's
  decision to move the recount behind closed doors, where it
  could not be observed by the public or the media, and to limit
  the recount to only a select set of the votes.

~ No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the
  decision, and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated
  clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd.

~ The police made no arrests, received no assault complaints,
  and did not even instruct the crowd to desist.  The crowd was
  quieted promptly.


MYTH:  In Nassau County, the board violated Florida law by
adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by
the board as illegal.

FACT:
~ On election night, all the votes were counted, but during the
  machine recount, 218 ballots were accidentally separated from
  the rest, and not counted.  As a result, Bush received 124
  fewer votes and Gore received 73 fewer votes than on election
  night.

~ After the recount, the Nassau County Board supervisor
  discovered her mistake, and tried to correct it.  Because the
  Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final
  certification until Sunday at 5:00 p.m., the Division of
  Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the
  count to make it accurate.

~ The Board (2 Democrats and 1 Republican) voted unanimously to
  certify the original election night count - which included the
  218 ballots - rather than the machine recount total (which
  mistakenly omitted those ballots).

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Regrettably, the Gore campaign has now filed a lawsuit
contesting the certified election results in Florida.  Their
aim is to overturn the outcome of the election after 19 days of
counts and recounts.

As I said last night, America has never had a presidential
election decided by a contest of the election outcome in court.
This is an extraordinary procedure and we are entering new,
uncertain, and controversial territory.

Therefore, I would now like to introduce the senior members of
the litigation team who will be defending the vote of
Floridians in favor of Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.

I have earlier introduced you to Barry Richard of Tallahassee,
Florida, with the national law firm of Greenburg Traurig.  Mr.
Richard, a former Deputy Attorney General for the State of
Florida, has 33 years of trial experience.

Other members of our team are Fred Bartlit and Phillip Beck of
the law firm Bartlit Beck of Chicago, Illinois.  Together they
bring to this team 59 years of practice as trial attorneys.

The other two members of our senior litigation team are law
partners of mine at Baker Botts, in Houston, Texas.  Together,
Daryl Bristow and Irv Terrell have 68 years of experience
practicing in court.

These five gentlemen are here to summarize our view of all the
overall contest proceedings and to set the record straight on
four issues the Gore campaign continues to mischaracterize.

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING...

Quotes from Democrats:

""It's not saying Al Gore should do everything down to the last
legal limit to get the election...I don't think he should.""
  - US Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin;
    Lacrosse Tribune, 11/28/00


U.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, will vote for
Texas Gov. George W. Bush if the presidential race is ultimately
decided by the U.S. House of Representatives.

""I will vote the way the majority of my constituents in the Fifth
Congressional District voted.  And in this case, Governor Bush
carried [my district].""
  - The (Mississippi) Sun Herald, 11/28/00


Monday, Indiana House Speaker John Gregg, D-Sandborn, called on
Gore to end the disputes that have kept the presidential election
in doubt for 20 days.

""He needs to pick up the phone, call Austin and say, 'Mr.
President, congratulations. I support you as president 100
percent.""
  - Indianapolis Star, 11/26/00


Self-described liberal Democrat Pat Caddell on MSNBC's ""Hardball
with Chris Matthews,"" 11/27/00:
""They're talking about 26,000 people that they said their votes
didn't count.  There are 35,000 other people in Florida who's
votes were not counted that lie in George Bush country...Many,
many more are Bush votes and they don't say a word about that.""


Quotes from Media:

Peggy Noonan on Fox News Channel's ""Hannity and Colmes,"" 11/27/00:
""...a lot of emotional symbolism and emotional language without
having that symbolism and language buttressed by a good spine of
thought and logic and argument...

""You cannot say of the ballot, just because nobody voted for Bush
or Gore, that it's really a secret Gore vote that didn't get
counted...""


Salon.com's Joan Walsh, 11/28/00:
""His condescending, singsong delivery of a bland speech Monday
night was so inadequate to the gravity of the moment it was
almost insulting.""


Don Imus and Howard Fineman on MSNBC's ""Imus in the Morning,""
11/28/00:
Imus:  ""What if Gore had won, and Bush...I mean, what if the
roles were reversed, how would, I wouldn't want to include you in
this, but how would the liberal weenies of the news media be
treating all this if the roles were reversed.""

Fineman: ""Oh my God, ...you kidding?!  That George Bush
was a cry baby, that he was the spoiled son of a failed
President.  You know, you can just here it.  The personal attacks
on Bush would be just absolutely vicious.""


Ceci Connolly and Chip Reid on MSNBC, 11/27/00:
Connolly:  ""But you also saw that sort of preachy Al Gore, that
you sometimes get, that has turned off many Americans over time.
And you also got a little bit of whining, frankly, when he
started talking about voter intimidation.""

Reid:  ""Some thought it very odd, why they had all the
photographers in there flashing.  It was a bit distracting.  And
the flags, some people think maybe it's an overdose on the flags.
And another question:  a very formal setting for a very personal
conversation with the American people.""


Howard Fineman on MSNBC, 11/27/00:
Fineman: ""He (Gore) had to make clear to people that there was
something about him, some essential goodness in him, that made
it worth fighting this fight.  And when he said, 'If I lose, so
be it,' he had to be convincing on that point.  And I must say,
after all the arguing in this very divided election, it's going
to be hard for most Americans to agree with that...

""...most Americans think that this election was fair.  He's got
to make the case that it isn't, and it's hard for him to do it.

""...political terms, I'm not sure how much time he really has...""

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 With the injury to Joe Jurevicius, Dixon will take over as the Giants' third 
down receiver. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Fear Updated 12/12/00 
 An MRI performed on Monday revealed a sprained medial collateral ligament in 
Jurevicius' left knee. Head Coach Jim Fassel says that Jurevicus is expected 
to be sidelined for at least three to four weeks.  Ron Dixon will take over 
as the Giants' third down receiver. At this point, neither player has any 
real Fantasy value.     

 Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Cowboys' defensive line played its best games of the season, sacking 
Redskins' quarterback Jeff George five times while limiting Stephen Davis to 
only 57 yards rushing. Dallas' unit, which has been ravaged by injuries, held 
the 'Skins to only 13 points on the afternoon and looked much more like a 
cohesive unit than in recent weeks. Expect the Cowboys to follow up this 
effort with another solid performance against the Giants, but look long and 
hard before giving Dallas' D the start this week.   

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 With the announcement that Jeff George will remain Washington's starter for 
the last two games, Johnson's season and Fantasy value is all but gone. Don't 
be surprised to see Johnson in a new uniform come training camp.    

 Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00 
 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.  Coach 
Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning 
to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.  Fantasy owners should look 
elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.  Griese hasn't played in almost a month.  A 
player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.      

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that 
have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to 
be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.  

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar 
has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards 
and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four 
games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to 
Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.   

 Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them 
going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also 
dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up 
against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much 
as a result.  

 James Thrash , WR WAS - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 
 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the 
Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, 
so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league 
uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three 
man.   

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more 
than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games 
prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by 
being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take 
this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over 
the final two games.  

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win 
over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.   

 Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run 
a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy 
value at this point in the season.   

 Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He 
missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year 
career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't 
start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 
 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the 
Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being 
bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in 
your Fantasy season.   

 Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He 
rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was 
walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to 
play next Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 
 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in 
two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback 
situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.   

 R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several 
team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made 
several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a 
October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder 
of the season.  

 Larry Centers , RB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/11/00 
 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' 
Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.   

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, 
allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the 
Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by 
this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of 
injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati 
next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.  

 Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 
carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks 
to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.   

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00 
 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing 
for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a 
touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm 
is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to 
try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as 
Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.   

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Risk Managers Updated 12/11/00 
 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 
346 yards.  Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from 
the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.  If you are one 
of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to 
Fantasy glory.   

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this 
week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 
passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the 
starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday 
against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins 
this week.    

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 
 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He 
gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.  With his 
performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.   
 

 Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Murder Inc. Updated 12/11/00 
 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also 
bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers 
are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team 
when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.  

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.  He 
will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter 
will be up for the task.  He struggled in their first meeting but still 
managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.    

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game 
against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went 
down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving 
Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in 
the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' 
quarterbacks all together.   

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game 
against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven 
carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the 
game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of 
the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy 
value to help you at this important stage of the season.   

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/11/00 
 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.  Look for 
Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.  He had six catches 
for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.    

 Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three 
opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, 
could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham 
(groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. 
Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should 
hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a 
better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' 
D this week.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Brian Griese , QB DEN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.  Coach 
Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning 
to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.  Fantasy owners should look 
elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.  Griese hasn't played in almost a month.  A 
player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.      

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that 
have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to 
be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.  

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar 
has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards 
and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four 
games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to 
Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.   

 Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them 
going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also 
dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up 
against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much 
as a result.  

 James Thrash , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the 
Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, 
so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league 
uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three 
man.   

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more 
than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games 
prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by 
being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take 
this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over 
the final two games.  

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win 
over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.   

 Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run 
a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy 
value at this point in the season.   

 Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He 
missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year 
career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't 
start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the 
Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being 
bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in 
your Fantasy season.   

 Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He 
rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was 
walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to 
play next Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 James McKnight , WR DAL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in 
two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback 
situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.   

 R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several 
team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made 
several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a 
October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder 
of the season.  

 Larry Centers , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' 
Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.   

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Klap Updated 12/11/00 
 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, 
allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the 
Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by 
this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of 
injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati 
next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.  

 Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 
carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks 
to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.   

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing 
for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a 
touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm 
is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to 
try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as 
Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.   

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 12/11/00 
 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 
346 yards.  Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from 
the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.  If you are one 
of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to 
Fantasy glory.   

 Jeff George , QB WAS - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this 
week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 
passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the 
starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday 
against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins 
this week.    

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He 
gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.  With his 
performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.   
 

 Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Top Dogs Updated 12/11/00 
 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also 
bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers 
are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team 
when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.  

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/11/00 
 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.  He 
will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter 
will be up for the task.  He struggled in their first meeting but still 
managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.    

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game 
against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went 
down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving 
Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in 
the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' 
quarterbacks all together.   

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game 
against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven 
carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the 
game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of 
the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy 
value to help you at this important stage of the season.   

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.  Look for 
Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.  He had six catches 
for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.    

 Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three 
opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, 
could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham 
(groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. 
Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should 
hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a 
better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' 
D this week.   

 Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/11/00 
 Culpepper completed 21-of-33 passes for 221 yards and three touchdowns in a 
losing cause Sunday.  He also added an eight-yard scoring run of his own.  
Although the Vikings struggled as a team Sunday Culpepper will continue to 
help Fantasy owners for the duration of the season.    

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Coach Dick LeBeau was impressed enough with Mitchell's performance on Sunday 
against Tennessee that he named him the starting quarterback next Sunday 
against Jacksonville. The veteran QB was 12-for-26 passing for 131 yards with 
no touchdowns or interceptions, and was sacked four times. Mitchell should 
still be nowhere near your roster during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Brad Daluiso , K NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Daluiso ws good on all three of his field goal attempts on Sunday, 
converting from 38, 40 and 21 yards against Pittsburgh. He has now been 
successful on 12 consecutive attempts dating back to Week Seven against New 
York's next opponent, the Dallas Cowboys. Unless you have one of the league's 
top-notch kickers, starting Daluiso is a solid choice.    

 Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 12/11/00 
 Ismail seemed to be much more in synch with quarterback Trent Dilfer during 
Sunday's game against San Diego. He had six catches for 80 yards and a 
touchdown, a 28-yarder the two call a ""slugo"" (slant and go). Although it 
looked for a bit like Ismail wasn't worth a look during your playoffs, he 
could finally be at the point where he'll give you good numbers. Give him 
consideration next Sunday when he faces Arizona.

Statement by Governor George W. Bush
November 22, 2000

""I am disappointed with last night's ruling by the Florida Supreme Court.  We 
believe the justices have used the bench to change Florida's election laws 
and usurp the authority of Florida's election officials.  We believe the 
court overreached. Writing laws is the duty of the legislature; administering 
laws is the duty of the executive branch.

""Two weeks after the presidential election, a court has decided that
Florida's deadline for counting votes and certifying votes was not a
deadline at all. The court has decided that the selective recounting of votes 
that have already been counted at least two times, and in some cases three or 
four times, will continue more than a week after the law says it should. And 
the court has ordered that the secretary of state must accept all this.

""The court had cloaked its ruling in legalistic language. But make no
mistake, the court rewrote the law. It changed the rules, and it did so after 
the election was over.

Statement by James Baker III, Senior Advisor, Bush-Cheney Recount

""At Monday's oral argument before the Florida Supreme Court,
Justice Harding asked a key question about Florida's electoral
laws and standards: ""Is it right to change the rules in the
middle of the game?""

""The Florida Supreme Court and some Democratic county electoral
boards have now decided to do just that.

Gore Has No Chance To Win Unless He Changes The Rules Again To Count
Dimpled Ballots, So...

 ~ For the past week, the Gore campaign has been saying that
   the Florida Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of
   this election.  But now that they didn't get a decision
   exactly to their liking, the Gore campaign is backpedaling
   and saying that they will leave all their options open.

 ~ In response to inquiries about whether dimpled chads can be
   counted as votes, the Florida Supreme Court cited the Hartke
   case in Illinois, but the Illinois case didn't talk about
   dimpled chads at all. It involved hanging chads, the
   standard that these three counties began using and the
   standard that they are now seeking to change.

 ~ There has been a lot of talk about statutes in Texas
   governing manual recounts.  In Texas this would all be over
   because Texas only allows one manual recount, and it has
   very clear and objective standards.  The first of those is
   when you see light coming through, and the second of those
   is where you have a hanging chad. It's only in the third
   instance that the statute in Texas speaks about any
   consideration of a dimpled chad, and it doesn't say that a
   dimpled chad can be considered standing alone. It says it
   can be considered only where it also is accompanied by a
   clearly ascertainable intent of the voter to vote.

 ~ With its decision, the Florida Supreme Court has decided
   to 'change the rules in the middle of the game.'

 ~ The Florida Supreme Court has now assumed the role of both
   the executive and legislative branches.  They effectively
   rewrote statutes that had been enacted by the Florida
   Legislature and took over responsibilities that rightly
   belonged to the Florida Secretary of State.

 ~ This decision by seven Democrat justices completely
   politicizes the vote-counting process by putting the fate
   of this election in the hands of the six Democrats, two
   independents and only one Republican that control the
   Canvassing Boards in the counties conducting manual
   recounts.

 ~ In a transparent attempt to overturn the results of this
   election, the Gore campaign is now trying to rewrite the
   rules in three counties that are still conducting manual
   recounts.

 ~ Statistical experts have said that under the current
   standards, Gore will not get enough votes to overcome
   Governor Bush's lead.  So now the Gore campaign is looking
   to change those standards in the middle of the process.

 ~ The Gore campaign wants to count ballots that have only a
   slight indentation.  No hole in the ballot is necessary.
   No single loose corner is necessary.  Not even seeing any
   light through the ballot is necessary.  This lenient
   standard has been proposed solely for Democrats to invent
   enough votes to overturn the election.

 ~ Ten years ago, the Democratic Supervisor of Elections in
   Palm Beach County issued a guideline about how ballots
   should be counted that stated, ""But a chad that is fully
   attached, bearing only an indentation, should not be
   counted as a vote.""  Now Democrats want to unfairly change
   those rules.

 ~ The Gore campaign knows that the only way to get the votes
   they need is to keep changing the rules.  This is unfair
   and unacceptable.  This election must be decided by the
   rules that existed on Election Day, not the rules
   rewritten by the Gore campaign in a politically charged
   environment two weeks later.

SEND IN THE THUGS
Michael Kelly
11/22/00

Excerpt:
""Even if Gore ultimately loses in Florida, he will have come
very, very close to winning. Moreover, he will have done this
with his image-skin more or less intact. For Gore has already
won an astonishing propaganda victory: With the help of
reasonably sympathetic coverage from a largely Democratic and
liberal national press corps, he has managed to spin his
extraordinary, radical, unprecedented behavior as reasonable -
and legitimate. This probably ensures that future close
presidential elections will produce future Gore Losers,
marching off to the courts and the cameras with their armies
of lawyers and thugs, demanding recounts, rewriting the rules
and the laws, convincing more and more Americans that their
electoral system is, like those in most of the world, just
another rigged game.

Thanks, Al, we needed that.""

The Palm Beach Post
Gore's Point Man Argued Against Dimples in 1996
Joel Engelhardt, Palm Beach Post
11/22/00

Excerpts:
""Amid the swarm of the world press outside the county Emergency
Operations Center, Dennis Newman leads the charge to find new
votes for Al Gore in the dimples of the Palm Beach County
ballot.

""His argument, put simply, is that dimples show the true intent
of the voter. Voters caused those dimples. Dimples should count.

""Four years ago, in a similar election spat, Newman took a much
different stand. Employing his best legal tactics on behalf of
a Democrat holding a slight lead in a primary race for
Congress, Newman scoffed at the idea of counting the tiny
indentations as votes.

""Like the Republicans watching now, Newman wondered out loud how
ballots that had been handled over and over, in recount after
recount, could still be impartially judged. Couldn't the
ballots -- and therefore the votes -- be affected by all that
touching and grabbing?

194,"Breaking news:

Leon County circuit Judge Terry Lewis has just rejected a
court petition by Vice President Al Gore to force Florida to
accept hand recounted votes.  This ruling clears the way for
the Florida Division of Elections to certify the final vote
tally tomorrow.

That's great news -- but the post-election battle is not over
yet.

""Hand counting"" of ballots is still going on at this very
minute in Palm Beach and Broward counties.  If the ruling by
Judge Lewis stands, Florida's Division of Elections can
throw out these ""hand counts.""  But the Gore legal team is
appealing the decision today and it's very likely that the
Florida Supreme Court will be hearing the case shortly.

The Florida Supreme Court is comprised of six Democrats and
1 independent, and they've already ruled in Gore's favor to
allow the ""hand counting"" of ballots earlier this week.

Yes, this situation is still a mess.   That's why it's still
important for us to be mobilizing in favor of fair election
practices and integrity in the ballot counting process.  The
votes were counted on election day -- and George W. Bush won
Florida.  The votes were recounted in the days that followed
-- and George W. Bush won Florida.

Now the Democrats have hand picked a couple of counties
where they think they can manufacture enough votes to make
up the difference through ""hand counting"" of ballots.
What's worse is they're using ballot examining techniques
that amount to mind reading to determine whether or not
voters meant to vote for Al Gore.

Thank you for signing your Petition to block these
objectionable ""hand counts"" and Certify the Bush Victory in
Florida.  Every day we pick up more supporters (we're
closing in on 200,0000!) and every day we pick up more media
recognition as we swamp Florida with your Petitions.

Here's the bottom line: we are not going to let Al Gore
steal this election.   Send anyone and everyone who might be
interested in fighting for the integrity of this election to
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com to sign our petition
and see breaking news on the action in Florida right now.

 Garnett hurt his right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to=

have it examined Wednesday.  He is expected to play against the Wizards=20
Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation.  Something as simple as an injured=

Fantasy numbers.   =20

 Terry Davis , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Davis will be eligible to come off the injured list Sunday but Achilles=20
tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him sidelined a little bit=

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's game against the Heat=
=20
and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the Magic.  Keon Clark=
=20
will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play.  The leg is sore=
=20
now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few days.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00=20
 Hill may be ready to return to the court for Thursday night's game against=
=20
the Nuggets. He has missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he=
=20
practiced on Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court.=
=20
""I can't give you the official thumbs up,"" said Head Coach Doc Rivers, ""but=

likely get him back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a=20
four-game West Coast road trip.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 According to The Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful=
=20
that Trent will travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing o=
n=20
the East Coast.  Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but coul=
d=20
be back in action in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the=20
first preseason game with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a goo=

rn=20
Fantasy owners should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately=
=20
need a forward.    =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marbury missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of a=
n=20
ankle injury. He turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turne=
d=20
it again the following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is=20
still lacking some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankl=

the Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have the=

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Carter was in uniform for Wednesday night's game against Portland, but he=
=20
didn't see any playing time. ""Air Canada"" said that he felt well enough to=
=20
play, but team doctors wouldn't give him permission to get in the game. ""We=

before Monday, so most Fantasy owners can re-insert him into their lineup i=
n=20
time for next week.   =20

 Andre Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 Miller took a knee to the nose during Wednesday night's game at Chicago=20
which sent him to the bench temporarily. He returned to the game with a=20
vengeance, finishing with 20 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in=20
Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The shot to the nose won't keep Miller from=20
missing any playing time, so continue to use the young point guard in your=
=20
starting lineup.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Brand missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night against=20
Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with his hyperextended left kne=
e,=20
and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.  Brand is listed as day =
to=20
day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chance of playing on Friday=20
night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurring on Monday, Fantasy=
=20
owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in their lineup for next=
=20
week's games.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/06/00=20
 The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT scan=20
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the=
=20
team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per=
=20
contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but=20
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes=
. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Dudley will travel with the Suns on their end of the week road-trip that=
=20
starts in Milwaukee Thursday.  He will most likely be questionable for all=
=20
the games.  Look for him to finally return to action next week.  With Dudle=
y=20
out of the lineup Corie Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to=
=20
get playing time.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding=20
makes him a starter on your Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his=
=20
position.   =20

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Lakers because of pain =
in=20
his right ankle.  He was scheduled to see a foot specialist on Tuesday and=
=20
underwent surgery last season to remove bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mil=
ls=20
on your Fantasy bench for now.  If you are playing in a small league drop h=
im=20
from your roster and add another forward.    =20

 Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00=20
 Mercer sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu. =
=20
Corey Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's stat=
us=20
for Wednesday's game is up in the air.  He has been a major disappointment =
so=20
far this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your=20
roster, if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The=
=20
way Mercer has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a bett=
er=20
guard.   =20

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Williams sprained his ankle in Tuesday's game against the Grizzlies and is=
=20
questionable for Wednesday's contest at Seattle.  The ankle will probably=
=20
limit Williams' production in the next few games so use a healthy forward=
=20
instead.   =20

 Billy Owens , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Owens strained his right biceps in Tuesday's game against Vancouver.  He h=
as=20
actually been productive this season when healthy, but don't gamble on him.=
 =20
Owens has been injury prone throughout his career and is too risky a player=
=20
to take a chance on.  Use a more durable player instead.    =20

 Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Smith got his first start as a Piston Tuesday at power forward.  He scored=
=20
12 points and grabbed eight rebounds.  With his promotion into the starting=
=20
lineup it is now safe to start Smith on your Fantasy team.  With an increas=

role Smith will be a consistent rebounder and scorer.   =20

 John Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00=20
 Wallace was placed on the injured list due to tendonitis in his left knee.=
 =20
He is a good offensive player but his shortcomings on defense have limited=

his playing time.  His lack of playing time prevents him from being a=20

                A MESSAGE FROM DON EVANS
               CHAIRMAN, BUSH-CHENEY 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Sunday, November 11, 2000



  Dear Friend,


  This is an urgent message to supporters of Governor George
  W. Bush and Secretary Dick Cheney regarding the situation
  in Florida.

  It is now clear we must raise money to fund the recount
  effort in Florida.  Governor Bush won the vote on Election
  Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, the other
  side is seeking yet a third count by hand.  There is a
  reason why ballots are counted by computer and not by hand.

  The expense of the recount effort must be funded
  immediately.  Please send a check in any amount that you
  can up to $5,000 today. These contributions, in keeping
  with Governor Bush's ""full disclosure"" policy on financial
  contributions, will be posted on the Bush-Cheney website.
  Any funds not spent will be returned on a pro rata basis.

  To contribute, please click here:
  http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf to
  download the Bush-Cheney recount fund reply form. Please
  fill out the form and mail in with your donation.

  We are setting up a site for secure online credit card
  contributions.  As soon as the Web site is available,
  we'll send out an e-mail with the link for online
  contributions.

  Remember:
  1. Checks must be personal, not corporate.
  2. Checks should be payable to Bush-Cheney Recount Fund.
  3. Download and fill out this form:
     http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf
  4. Mail or overnight check to:
        Donald L. Evans
        301 Congress Avenue
        2nd Floor/Bush-Cheney Recount Fund
        Austin, Texas 78701
  5. These funds do not count against your annual personal
     federal giving limit of $25,000.

  Thank you for your friendship and support.  If you have
  friends that can help, please forward this message to them
  immediately.   We thank you for all that you did to help
  elect Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.  We also thank
  you in advance for your willingness to help us during this
  important time in the life of our country.


  Sincerely,

  Don Evans

233,"Dear St. Arnold's Army:

Ho! Ho! Ho!

This Friday, November 10 will be our 6th annual Christmas Ale Pub Crawl!  And 
for the survivors, you will be mugged.  That is, you will receive a free St. 
Arnold mug.  To qualify, all you have to do is make it to four of the stops.  
This is always a fun event, but we also have a list of suggestions for all 
participants for maximum enjoyment.  But first, where will it be?  Well, it 
cannot be preannounced to specific bars, but here is the general info: 

We will be in the Greater Rice Village Area.

We will begin at 6:00 pm.  We will gather immediately before the crawl at the 
parking lot on the south side of Bissonnet just east of Kirby, next to the 
Chevron Station.  The parking lot has a sign that says Wayland Properties (or 
something very close to that).  We will look for a bar near there to start.  
Hopefully the Bentley will be parked obviously everywhere we go.  

At 7:00, we will proceed eastward on Bissonnet.
At 8:00, we will proceed south on Morningside, turning right on Quemby.
At 9:00, we will proceed south on Kirby a block or so.
At 10:00, we will proceed further south down Kirby, then left on Rice.
At 11:00, we will proceed east on University, then take a right on 
Morningside.  For this finale, we'll do a couple of bars at once on 
Morningside.  

The Hotline numbers to try to hook up with us during the crawl are: 
713-202-4557 and 281-686-5090.  Use this if hopelessly lost.

Now, for the tips for maximum enjoyment:

1. PRECOATING: Try to eat something before commencing the crawl. 
2. PACING: Too many Christmas Ales at the first stop is a critical strategic 
mistake.  This is known as ""Sprinting Too Early"" which is not advisable in 
this, a distance event.  Can have negative repercussions later.
3. MANNERS: Be patient with bar staff.  Remember, 100 or so people just 
descended upon some poor, unsuspecting crew.  They will be working as fast as 
they can, but they won't have 10 people serving us as there will probably not 
be another mass of jubilant humanity arriving upon our departure.  This is 
also sometimes referred to as the ""Bum Rush"", but in our case, it is the 
""Saintly Rush"".
4. BUDDY SYSTEM: Make sure that you are always in contact with a couple of 
people you know.  One of you is bound to notice that the pack is starting to 
move on to the next stop.  This prevents the disoriented feeling of looking 
around an empty bar and realizing that the only three people still in there 
are guzzling some inferior malted beverage and may be related to the missing 
link.
5. MAKE NEW FRIENDS: As everyone on this crawl will be intelligent and good 
looking, this is an excellent place to meet new people.  Also, you will note 
that some people become better looking as the crawl wears on.  If this 
occurs, be sure to consult your Buddy System partner.
6. DESIGNATED DRIVER: Yes, we encourage this strongly.  You never know when 
you might decide to run for president.  And even the designated drivers on 
the crawl qualify for the mug.  While pregnant wives are perfect for this 
role, it is known to be poor judgment for a husband to claim that this is the 
best part of her being pregnant.  See ""Mood Swings.""
7. ENJOY ST. ARNOLD'S BEERS: It is in poor taste to be seen quaffing anything 
else.  Ever.  See ""Curse of Saint Arnold.""

We look forward to seeing y'all out there. Feel free to dress like Santa, St. 
Arnold or Rudolph.  Actually, not like Rudolph.  Deer season just opened.

Cheers,

Brock, David, Frank (both), James, Jamie, Jesse, Pete aka the Brew Crew!

PS:  Want to sell St. Arnold's or know someone that does?  Our distributor, 
Glazers, is hiring for a couple of positions in their beer department.  I'm 
not sure what they all are, but they are probably looking for a salesman, keg 
delivery driver and service tech/line cleaner.  Anyone who is interested 
should call Leroy Krischke at 713-578-1610 or Mike Allison at 713-795-4454.

If you have a scale at home, and you know what the weight limit  is, then you 
can weigh your bags at home - and if your bag is too  heavy, then you need to 
lighten your load by removing non-essential  items. -Sabrina O.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Pickens was unable to play the full game Sunday against Pittsburgh after 
re-injuring his hamstring. He didn't have a catch for the second straight 
week, the first time in his career he has done that. If Pickens can't play 
Sunday, the ailing Titans will probably struggle against the tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Sanders, who was forced to leave Sunday's game against Pittsburgh with 
strained rib cartilage, may be limited in practice this week, but will likely 
play next Sunday against Baltimore. He had four catches for 70 yards in the 
game, and should continue to serve as one of the Titans' top two receivers 
(with Derrick Mason) as long as Carl Pickens and Yancey Thigpen are ailing. 
If Tennessee is forced to turn to another option, the only players left are 
inexperienced Chris Jackson and Chris Coleman.  

 Tony Martin , WR MIA - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Martin is expected to return to action this week against the Chargers.  He 
has been recovering from a stress fracture in his right foot that has kept 
him out of six games this season.    

 Al Del Greco , K TEN - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Del Greco missed a 24-yard field goal last Sunday against Pittsburgh, 
breaking a string of 46 straight from within 30 yards dating back to 1994. 
Still, he atoned for the miss by kicking the game-winner, a 30-yarder to 
close out the game, and added two other field goals. No reason to downgrade 
his value at this point.  

 Dolphins , DT MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/07/00 
 The Dolphins' defense put up another stellar effort on Sunday, holding the 
Lions to only eight points while playing at one of the NFL's toughest 
stadiums, the Silverdome. The Fish recorded two sacks, an interception, and 
recovered two fumbles in the game, while holding the Lions to only 268 yards 
of total offense. In injury news, linebacker Zach Thomas will miss this 
Sunday's game against the Chargers and may not be ready to play until after 
Miami's November 19th date with the Jets.  He is still recovering from a 
severely sprained ankle.  On a better note for Miami, defensive tackle Tim 
Bowens is expected to return to practice this week and will likely play 
against San Diego.        

 Steelers , DT PIT - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 The Steelers' defense held Tennessee to nine points Sunday, and extended its 
streak of not allowing a touchdown to 20 quarters. Despite a mistake late in 
the fourth quarter that allowed the Titans to win the game, the Steelers gave 
Fantasy owners another solid performance. Pittsburgh sacked Steve McNair once 
and intercepted him another time in the game. Expect another solid outing 
next Sunday, when Philadelphia comes to town.  

 Colts , DT IND - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 It looks like defensive end Ellis Johnson will miss his second consecutive 
game this week when the Colts host the Jets on Sunday night.  ""I don't know 
about Ellis,"" said Head Coach Jim Mora, ""I kind of have my doubts.""  Johnson 
is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.        

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Lie Downs Updated 11/07/00 
 Harrison took a wicked hit to the back at the end of Sunday's game in 
Chicago, and complained of a stiff upper neck on Monday.  The injury isn't 
considered serious, and Harrison is expected to play this week against the 
Jets.  Against the Bears, Harrison caught six passes for 42 yards but was 
held out of the end zone for the first time in three weeks.  It was also the 
first time in five games that Harrison has been held under 100 yards 
receiving.    

 Kent Graham , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Although he won't start Sunday against Philadelphia, Graham is likely to get 
another shot at the job if Kordell Stewart doesn't improve. Graham averaged 
208 passing yards in his first three games, while Stewart is averaging 128 
yards in his four starts. Neither will take your Fantasy team to a league 
title.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Coach Bill Cowher named Stewart his starter for Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, despite a disappointing 112-yard passing game last Sunday. If 
Pittsburgh can't get it's air game going, expect Kent Graham to be 
re-installed as the starter over the upcoming weeks.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Edwards didn't record a single reception Sunday against Tennessee, and in 
fact, dropped a key pass during the game. With his recent struggles, it's 
likely Hines Ward and Bobby Shaw will get the majority of the passes the rest 
of the way.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 11/07/00 
 The Bills' defense held the Patriots to only 13 points on a cold and rainy 
day at Foxboro.  They sacked New England quarterbacks three times and 
recorded two interceptions as well, while keeping the Bills in the game with 
some tough goal-line stances.  On the injury front, defensive end Phil Hansen 
has been able to walk without crutches, but his sprained knee is expected to 
keep him out of action for another three to five weeks.     

 Cory Geason , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Geason will be sidelined for at least the next few games with a sprained 
left knee ligament. The Steelers, who have few other blocking tight ends on 
the roster, may need to sign one.  

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Morris suffered a thigh bruise during Sunday's game against the Patriots.  
Despite the injury, he is expected to practice with the team on Wednesday. 
The rookie running back complied 86 yards of total offense in Buffalo's 16-13 
overtime victory.     

 Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Risk Managers Updated 11/07/00 
 Bettis had just 42 rushing yards on 13 carries against one of the stingiest 
run defenses in the league, Tennessee, on Sunday. It was his lowest total 
since he had just eight yards in Week One against Baltimore. As a side note, 
Pittsburgh could be without center Dermontti Dawson for the rest of the 
season, and certainly will for at least the next few games due to a hamstring 
injury. Keep in mind that Bettis posted the lowest rushing yards total of his 
career (1,091) with Dawson missing nine games last season. We're not 
condemning Bettis, as he's still having a great season, but it's probably 
worth considering benching him against tougher defenses the rest of the way.  

 Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 The 'Skins expect to have both cornerback Darrell Green and outside 
linebacker Shawn Barber back for Washington's Monday night tilt with the Rams 
on November 20th. Green has missed three games with a strained calf muscle, 
while Barber has missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee.      

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/07/00 
 Johnson will miss Washington's next game, a November 20th contest in St. 
Louis on Monday night.  He is not expected to return the Redskins' starting 
lineup until November 26th against the Eagles.  Head Coach Norv Turner, in an 
attempt to avoid a quarterback controversy, has already stated that Johnson 
will be the starter when he is healthy enough to play.     

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/07/00 
 George completed 20-of-39 passes for 276 yards but threw  two interceptions 
in Sunday's loss to the Cardinals.  He will likely start Washington's next 
game on November 20th against the Rams while starter Brad Johnson recovers 
from a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 Cowboys' Head Coach Dave Campo said that he probably won't know until 
Wednesday if Aikman will be ready to go this Sunday against the Bengals.  The 
Cowboys' quarterback was scheduled to have a series of injections on Monday 
to relieve the inflammation in his lower back.  ""As tough as he is,"" said 
Campo, ""I wouldn't put it past him to be ready to go.""    

 Cardinals , DT ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/07/00 
 The Cards' defense put up a heroic effort on Sunday, holding the Redskins' 
offense to just 15 points in their big NFC East win.  In the game, cornerback 
Aeneas Williams returned a fumble 104 yards for a touchdown, tying the NFL 
record for the longest fumble returned for a score.  On the downside, Arizona 
placed defensive tackle Tony McCoy on the injured list, losing him for the 
remainder of the season. He had missed three games after having arthroscopic 
surgery on his right knee.  He will be replaced by Barron Tanner, whom the 
team signed as a free agent.    

 Pete Stoyanovich , K STL - The Lie Downs Updated 11/06/00 
 The Rams released kicker Pete Stoyanovich on Monday, a day after he missed 
two field-goal attempts in a loss to Carolina.  He missed badly from 37 and 
50 yards in the second quarter in Sunday night's 27-24 defeat at home.   The 
Rams are now looking to sign Jeff Hall who will take over as kicker until 
Jeff Wilkins recovers from his injured quadriceps.      

 Kris Heppner , K WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/06/00 
 The Redksins cut rookie Kris Heppner Monday.  Heppner was released by the 
Seahawks earlier this season.  The Redskins have a bye this week and will try 
out a number of prospects.  Among the many kickers they are considering 
hiring is 44-year old veteran Eddie Murray.    

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Ramiro Updated 11/06/00 
 Freddie Jones had another solid receiving week. He caught 5 passes for 86 
yards. Too bad he plays for a team with QB problems!  

 Justin Watson , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/06/00 
 Watson started in place of Marshall Faulk but didn't do tow well.  He gained 
just 12 yards on 12 carries but did manage to score on a short touchdown run. 
 

 Trent Green , QB STL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/06/00 
 Green was a Fantasy star once again this week, but in a losing effort.  He 
passed for a career-high 431 yards, completed 29-of-42 passes with two 
touchdowns and no interceptions.   

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 Leading the Panthers to the upset win, Beuerlein  completed 15-of-25 passes 
for 214 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.  Overall Beuerlein 
hasn't been as successful as he was last season but he is still just as 
effective.    

 Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 11/06/00 
 Robinson was a reliable Fantasy player once again on Sunday.  He had nine 
catches for 109 yards and scored a touchdown against the Colts.    

 Jim Miller , QB CHI - Ramiro Updated 11/06/00 
 Miller led the Bears to victory while starting for the injured Cade McNown 
Sunday.  He completed 24-of-35 passes for 214 yards and a touchdown.   

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 The NFL's leader in touchdown receptions didn't catch one on Sunday but he 
was still productive.  He caught six  passes for 97 yards.  Owens still leads 
the NFL with 11 TD receptions.     

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Fear Updated 11/06/00 
 Blake may have been the surprise star of Week 10, throwing three touchdown 
passes.  The Saints have generally relied on RB Ricky Williams to move the 
offense this season but they turned to Blake on Sunday and he did not 
disappoint.  Blake completed 20-of-26 passes for 275 yards.

FLY TO FLORIDA THIS HOLIDAY SEASON FROM $128 RT.
Just in time to gear up for holiday travel, we have new low fares to
Florida valid for flights beginning December 20 through January 9, 2001.
If you didn=01,t buy the cheap Florida fares we offered in August and
September, then you may now be experiencing the airfare ticket shock we
warned you about back then. The major airlines are now claiming to offer
discount fares through February 4, but their cheapest seats for travel
between December 20 through January 9, 2001 are already gone. The good
news is that we still have seats available to the sunny state of Florida
for as low as $128 roundtrip. Even though the published fares have no
cheap seats remaining, we have a way to get you there for less if you act
quickly. For instance, Dayton (OH) to Florida through Bestfares.com is
only $128 roundtrip. Most of our special fares are between $180 and $258
roundtrip.  For a sample of our inexpensive =01&Frugal Fares to Get You To
Florida,=018 visit:

HAWAII ON SALE FOR THE HOLIDAYS THROUGH FEBRUARY 15, 2001.
Yes, we have an assortment of excellent Hawaiian fares, but we want to be
upfront about availability. Certain cheap seats to Honolulu will be tight
between December 20 and 29, 2000, so act fast because we are currently
finding cheap fares to Kona and, on select holiday dates, to Maui. For
example, you can head to Maui or Kona from $395 roundtrip. Or how about
San Diego, Phoenix, Seattle, Portland (OR), Los Angeles or San Francisco
to Honolulu for an even lower $345 roundtrip? Fly from Dallas/Fort Worth,
Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis or Houston to Hawaii for $428 roundtrip.
From New York City, Boston, Washington (DC), Orlando or Miami, it=01,s $502
roundtrip. Check out our special fares to Hawaii. Travel is valid through
February 15, 2001. Be flexible and you can save a bundle. Click to:

FLY TO THE CARIBBEAN FROM $180 RT THROUGH MARCH 14, 2001.
We have some excellent cruise prices out of San Juan, Puerto Rico at the
moment. Combine this with our inexpensive airfare to San Juan as low as
$180 roundtrip through March 14, 2001, and you now have a double whammy
for a super Caribbean getaway! We have a great variety for you. For
instance, roundtrip airfare from New York City is $180, from Fort
Lauderdale $200, Orlando $246, Boston $252 and Chicago $286. Fly from
Denver, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle or Las Vegas to San
Juan for $414 roundtrip. These airfares can be up to 50 percent off.
Travel between December 18 and January 8, 2001 is sold out. For further
information, visit:

SENIORS AND COMPANIONS COAST-TO-COAST FOR $248 RT OR LESS.
This week, some of the best deals in America are for seniors age 62 and
over. One of the greatest things about senior discounts is that they allow
a companion of any age to travel along at the same low price. Plus, the
good news keeps getting better when you discover there are only 10
blackout dates on these amazing airfares: November 21, 25, 26 & 27 and
December 20, 21, 22, 23, 26 & 27. That=01,s it! If you can fly around those
dates, there is a good chance you could save a bundle. Here are some
examples. Fly from San Diego, Orange County, Ontario (CA), San Francisco,
Seattle, Portland (OR) or Las Vegas to Boston, New York City, Washington
(DC), Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale or more for only $238 roundtrip.
Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, New Orleans, Little Rock, Oklahoma
City or Tulsa to Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or
Norfolk is just $142 roundtrip. Take a look at our =01&Seniors Fly for Less
Across the USA=018 specials. This is a great time to buy the parents or
grandparents a great holiday gift of airfare. Click to:

HOLIDAY FARES TO CANADA FROM $60 RT THROUGH JANUARY 7, 2001.
If you want to fly to Canada during Thanksgiving or the late December
holidays, we have airfares as low as $60 to the Great White North. Now
that=01,s something to shout about. From Seattle to Vancouver, you can fly
for $60 roundtrip. From Portland (OR), it=01,s $93 roundtrip. San Francisco
to Vancouver is $112 roundtrip. Cleveland, Detroit or Pittsburgh to
Toronto is only $85 roundtrip. Hartford to Montreal is also $85 roundtrip.
From Boston or Providence, it=01,s $100 roundtrip. Newark to Montreal is $9=
1
roundtrip. If you want an inexpensive holiday excursion, then consider
Canada for a great getaway. The American dollar is quite strong now, room
rates are low, and of course, we have super cheap Canadian airfares from
over 40 US cities. To take advantage of the savings, visit:

EUROFARE IS BACK! HOPSCOTCH EUROPE FOR ONLY $89 PER FLIGHT
If you want to see city after city in Europe on a cheap buck there is only
one word to say and it=01,s =01&Eurofare.=018  Imagine flying from Paris to=
 Rome
for $89 or how about London to Amsterdam for that same incredibly low
rate?  All you have to do is purchase a round-trip transatlantic ticket on
Lufthansa or United Airlines from the USA to Europe and then you can
travel to more than 100 cities in 35 countries within Europe for only $89
per flight.  That=01,s right, Lufthansa Airlines=01, Eurofare is back and i=
t=01,s
taking you on a ride to your favorite European cities for only $89 per
flight!

One-way fares from Frankfurt to Rome are as high as $871 and Munich to
Paris currently sells for $345 on a major European Airline. At $89 per
flight for the same cities Eurofare is a great bargain! To qualify book a
roundtrip airline ticket on Lufthansa or United Airlines now through March
30, 2001 and you can add up to six additional flights within Europe for
only $89 per flight.  Your originating transatlantic flight must depart by
March 31, 2001 and your roundtrip travel must be completed by April 7,
2001.

Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players.? As we head dow=

the home stretch,  identifying those players moving up or down can be the=

=20
we head into our 11th week  of listing these players, it=01,s inevitable th=
at=20
some players will have made both  the upgrade or downgrade list.? Make  sur=
e=20
you understand, what we=01,re talking about is players that are moving.? In=

other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade lis=
t=20
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league.? It just  means I=
=01,m=20
concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR=

Laveranues  Coles may make the upgrade list even though he=01,s still fairl=

down the list  of WRs.? It=01,s all about which  direction players are movi=
ng.? =20
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and Downgrades.? Some of these players are obvious moves up or  do=
wn=20
and some aren't as clear.? Here's my list of guys I see moving this  week.

QBs Moving Up

QB Jeff  Blake (NO)?? Heard a funny thing on ESPN's Monday Night  Pregame=
=20
show.? The guys said that with the troubles in St. Louis, the road  to the=
=20
Super Bowl now runs through New Orleans.? It's been a while since  you've=
=20
been able to say that.? Blake struggled in the preseason but has  become mo=
re=20
comfortable with each game.? With a great rushing game  featuring Ricky=20
Williams and a star WR in Joe Horn, Blake's looking great.

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)? Shannon Sharpe predicted that when the Ravens =20
finally scored a TD, they'd score a bunch of them.? The big TE was  prophet=
ic=20
as Dilfer threw for 3 TDs Sunday.? He scrambled, improvised, and  made=20
excellent decisions.? A little confidence may be all he needed.?  He doesn'=
t=20
have a stellar WR corps with Qadry Ismail, Jermaine Lewis and Patrick =20
Johnson but he does have a great TE in Sharpe and a solid RB in Jamal =20
Lewis.?=20

QB Brian  Griese? (Den)? As expected, Griese's recent off the field  troubl=
es=20
had little impact to his performance on the field.? 327 yards and  a couple=
=20
of TDs is strong against a good Jets team.? The biggest reason for  his=20
upgrade though is the smashing return of RB Terrell Davis.? If Sunday  was=
=20
any indication, this offense could make some serious noise.

QB Shaun  King (TB)? With back to back solid games, Shaun King is turning =
=20
some heads.? He only passed for 110 yards Sunday but squeezed every yard  f=
or=20
all it was worth with 3 TDs.? He continued to target Keyshawn Johnson  even=
=20
to the point of forcing the ball in places it probably shouldn't have been =
=20
thrown.? It's tough to rely on a QB who plays in this conservative offense =
=20
but if you're thin at QB, King might be worth a shot.

QB Jim  Miller (Chi)? Miller clearly gave the Bears a boost with his solid =
=20
play Sunday.? Not only was he more accurate than the injured Cade McNown,  =
he=20
showed a better arm to boot.? Miller's gain will be McNown's lost and I  lo=
ok=20
for Miller to gain plenty over the next few weeks.

QB Danny  Kanell (Atl)? Kanell came in when Chandler left with a =20
concussion.? He played pretty well with 2 TDs on 218 yards.? Chandler  look=
s=20
to possibly miss this week's game and Kanell could be a nice play against  =
a=20
Detroit Defense.

?

RBs Moving  Up

RB Lamar  Smith (Mia)? He's made this list several times already this =20
year?but it's worth noting how good he's been lately.? Sunday's 2 TD /  125=
=20
yard day earned him the #1 RB ranking in many scoring systems.? I don't  se=
e=20
many reasons why he won't have continued success.

RB Terrell  Davis (Den)? In one of the more heartening performances of the =
=20
day, Terrell Davis looked great.? He showed the power and the burst that =
=20
we've come to expect from Davis over the years.? Coach Mike Shanahan said =
=20
during last week's practices that Davis looked as good as he'd ever seen =
=20
him.? After watching the game, I have to agree with him.?=20

RB J.R.  Redmond? (NE)?? According to coach Bill Belichick and  Boston Glob=
e=20
columnist Frank Dell'Apa, Redmond injured his foot during practice  and was=
=20
supposedly going to be limited Sunday.? Kevin Faulk was  unimpressive early=
=20
and Redmond never looked back after getting a chance.?  He's productive=20
without being impressive as he only averaged 2.8 yards per carry  on 24=20
attempts but did get the score.?=20

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal)? Much had been made of the Raven's troubles but Jamal=
 =20
Lewis had been running hard and effectively.? Lewis was held out of the =20
endzone once again but he rolled up 179 total yards with 109 rushing and 70=
 =20
yards receiving.? If Trent Dilfer and the passing game can keep things =20
rolling, I see no reason why Lewis can't hold up his end of the offense.

RB Justin  Watson (StL)? As you know by now, Marshall Faulk had knee surger=
y =20
Monday and will miss 2-3 weeks.? We've had Watson on our Waiver Wire Wonder=
 =20
list for a while as the guy who'd get a shot if Faulk went down.? He was =
=20
less than impressive yesterday with only 12 yards on 12 carries but he did=
=20
get  the TD.? Plus, coach Mike Martz said the game plan had been designed=
=20
around  Faulk and the skills he brings.? Look for Watson to perform better=
=20
with a  week to prepare.? Although Marshall Faulk is the only guy who'll gi=
ve=20
you  Faulk like numbers anytime soon in this offense.

RB Warrick  Dunn? Dunn had 18 carries Sunday and he continues to play a=20
bigger  role in this offense. It's coming at the expense of Mike Alstott.? =
It=20
seems  strange to see Dunn carry the load but that's exactly what he's been=
 =20
doing.? After the Minnesota game last week, Keyshawn Johnson said he told  =
QB=20
Shaun King that he needed to get the ball to ""19 and 28"" (Johnson and  Dunn=
)?=20
King evidently listened.? Makes you wonder who's really  coaching this team=
...

RB  Jermaine Fazande (SD)? Fazande looked to be in danger of losing  carrie=
s=20
last week but he responded Sunday with a nice day carrying the ball 22  tim=
es=20
for 74 yards (3.4 ypc) He also tacked on 37 yards receiving.? The  Chargers=
=20
are still struggling but Fazande could be a nice addition if you're  thin a=
t=20
RB.

?

WRs Moving  Up

WR  Keyshawn Johnson (TB)?? Johnson told QB Shaun King he wanted  the ball.=
?=20
King obliged and Johnson's made the most of it.? He only  had 3 receptions=
=20
for 47 yards but he managed TDs on 2 of those catches.? I  don't look for h=
im=20
to score every other time he touches he ball down the stretch  but I do thi=
nk=20
he could continue the roll.? You can bet the Bucs won't mess  around with=
=20
what's working for them.

WR Joe  Horn (NO)? Can you imagine if Elvis Grbac still had Joe Horn in  KC=
??=20
QB Jeff Blake's certainly glad to have him and Horn surely likes the  role =
of=20
the #1 WR.? He put together a great game Sunday with 167 yards on 9 =20
receptions.? WR Keith Poole isn't carrying his share of the load but RB =20
Ricky Williams is more than making up for it.

St. Louis  WRs? I'd look for Isaac Bruce, Az-zahir Hakim, and Torry Holt to=
 =20
all increase their production in the wake of Marshall Faulk's injury.? =20
Synergy can be a strange thing.? On most teams, I'd view the loss of the =
=20
star RB as a negative toward the WRs.? The Rams have so many passing  weapo=
ns=20
though, I think they can carry the team with a lesser RB in the  backfield.=
?=20

WR Donald  Hayes (Car)? Apparently, the loss of Wesley Walls can be =20
overcome.? Hayes made some great plays Sunday.? Not unlike Keyshawn  Johnso=
n,=20
he only caught 3 passes, but he made the most of them with 58 yards and  a=
=20
TD.? He looks to be back on track.

WR Muhsin  Muhammad (Car)? I received a few emails asking how in the world =
=20
could I continue to rank Muhammad as high as I did last week.? He's good, =
=20
that's how.? Sure, the Rams had something to do with his play (and the =20
ranking) but I like his activity.? He caught 6 passes for 83 yards Sunday =
=20
night and should continue to play well.

WR Derrick  Mason (Ten)? I said a few weeks ago that Mason could be the bes=
t =20
WR on the team.? Now I'm sure of it.? Of course, it's a team that  doesn't=
=20
throw the ball very well and when they do throw, the TE is the primary =20
target.? Still though, he's a solid contributor and you could certainly do =
=20
worse at WR.? His special teams play is a nice bonus if your league let's =
=20
you ""double dip"" the WR and special teams categories.

WR  Laveranues Coles (NYJ)? Coles continues to play great  football.? He=20
ranks as the #26 WR over the last 3 games.? Keep an eye  on him for keeper=
=20
leagues as his play is very encouraging considering his lack  of experience=
.?=20
He should only get better.

WR Marcus  Robinson (Chi)? I told you Robinson doesn't seem to care who's =
=20
throwing the ball and Robinson came through Sunday with 90 yards and a TD.?=
 =20
New QB Jim Miller definitely gave the Bears a spark and Robinson benefited=
=20
from  it.? Don't be surprised to see him keep it rolling.

?

TEs Moving  Up

TE Shannon  Sharpe?(Bal)? Sharpe led the charge as the Ravens came  roaring=
=20
back.? He's clearly the best receiver on the team and you can bet  QB Trent=
=20
Dilfer will continue feeding him the ball.

TE Ricky  Dudley (Oak)? Dudley was a guy who kept raising eyebrows on our =
=20
weekly cheatsheets.? Even though he made the downgrade list a couple of =20
times, we kept him fairly high on the overall list just based on  potential=
.?=20
Dudley finally showed some of that potential Sunday with a  couple of TDs.?=
=20
It's worth noting that he scored 9 TDs in 1999.? 7 of  them came in the=20
second half of the season.

TE Jay  Reimersma? (Buf)? Reimersma seemed less rusty Sunday as he  hauled=
=20
down 6 receptions for 49 yards.? Flutie will probably get another  start th=
is=20
week and look for him to continue leaning on the big TE.

?

Players  Moving Down

QBs Moving  Down

QB Donovan  McNabb?(Phi)? McNabb only completed 56% of his passes  Sunday.?=
=20
And even for the ones he completed, he only averaged 9.9 yards per =20
completion which is a bad sign.?? He doesn't seem to be?making  the=20
improvements and progression you'd like to see from a QB with his =20
experience.

QB Charlie  Batch (Det)? Batch was banged around repeatedly Sunday.? He =20
eventually left with a concussion and his status for this week will be =20
determined probably by Wednesday.? You've probably seen it by now, but  coa=
ch=20
Bobby Ross resigned.? I doubt that'll have too much effect on the  offense.

QB Drew  Bledsoe (NE)? Bledsoe suffered a very Brett Favre like banged up =
=20
thumb as he hit a defender's helmet.? He was in obvious pain on the =20
sidelines and looked extremely frustrated not being able to play.? X - rays=
 =20
were negative but he's still hampered by it.? They'll make a decision on it=
 =20
this week but even if he can go, he could be limited.

QB Chris  Chandler (Atl)? Once again, Chandler was led off the field lookin=
g =20
punch drunk.? It wasn't pretty.? Danny Kannell actually played pretty  well=
=20
and could get the start this week.

?

RBs Moving  Down

RB Corey  Dillon (Cin)? As expected, the dream became reality vs a tough =
=20
Baltimore defense.? I traded him in my league last week and hope you did  t=
he=20
same.? I'll say it again, a RB can only do so much when there is  absolutel=
y=20
no threat of the QB throwing the ball.? Akili Smith is world  class awful.?=
=20

RB Mike  Alstott (TB)? As Warrick Dunn becomes a bigger part of the Buc =20
offense, Alstott is playing a reduced role.? Part of the reason is likely =
=20
his fumbling problems but the effectiveness of Dunn is playing a part I'm =
=20
sure.? That and Keyshawn said to give it to Dunn...

RB Kimble  Anders (KC)? The ""featured"" back in KC had 2 carries Sunday.? =
=20
Never ever trust a Kansas City RB.? No matter what I might tell you in the =
=20
future, don't believe it.? They'll break your heart every time.?=20

RB Travis  Prentice (Cle)? Prentice averaged 1.4 yards per carry  Sunday.?=
=20
That won't get it done. Like a lesser version of Corey Dillon,  beware RBs=
=20
with QBs who don't scare anyone throwing the ball.? Doug  Pederson doesn't=
=20
scare anyone...=20

?

WRs Moving  Down

WR Johnnie  Morton (Det)? Morton's inability to take up the slack for the =
=20
departed Germane Crowell has been a huge disappointment.? He came up small =
=20
again Sunday and one has to wonder what will change in the future.

WR Herman  Moore (Det)? Let's put it this way:? JJ Stokes is the #4 WR  in=
=20
San Francisco and he had a better day than Moore...

WR Jacquez  Green (TB)? Like Alstott is suffering in the wake of Warrick =
=20
Dunn's success, Green is suffering as Keyshawn Johnson commands more =20
attention.? He only had 2 receptions and simply isn't getting the looks he =
=20
was earlier in the year.

WR Raghib  Ismail (Dal)? In what's become the uncomfortable norm, Dallas ha=
s =20
lost another WR to knee surgery.? There was so much promise this Summer  wi=
th=20
Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Joey Galloway and Raghib Ismail.? Things  can=20
change quickly.

WR Carl  Pickens (Ten)? Pickens injured his hamstring again this  week.? I=
=20
was high on him coming over to the Titans but he's been a non  factor.?=20
Derrick Mason is the best WR on the team.? By a mile.

?

TEs Moving  Down

TE Chad  Lewis (Phi)? After a hot start, Lewis has struggled of late as =20
defenses bracket him.? With no WR to take some heat on the downfield  route=
s,=20
it's not too hard to shut down the TE.?? Until McNabb and  Charles Johnson?=
/=20
Torrance Small get going, his troubles will likely  continue.

TE Tony  McGee (Cin)? McGee should be a nice weapon for the struggling QB =
=20
Akili Smith but he doesn't seem to be utilizing him as you'd expect.? He =
=20
caught only 2 passes Sunday.? The sad part is that almost made him the =20
leading receiver.?=20

Faulk To Undergo Knee Surgery
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1105/860356.html  From the article:  St.
Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk will undergo surgery Monday to remove
loose cartilage from his right knee, an injury that forced him out of Sunday
night's loss to the Carolina Panthers.

Faulk practiced Friday and went out for (pregame) warmups after having the
knee drained earlier Sunday, but the knee began to lock on him. Coach Mike
Martz said team doctors told him Faulk would miss only 2-3 weeks. But
teammate D'Marco Farr, a defensive tackle, was out a month with a similar
operation.

""He could feel the cartilage getting hung up in there,"" Martz said. ""Really,
there was nothing else to do.""

Justin Watson started in place of Faulk, who leads the NFL with 1,326 yards
from scrimmage. Faulk suited up for the first half, but was wearing sweats
after the break.
Watson scored on a 3-yard run in the third quarter, but finished with 12
yards on 12 carries.

Faulk has been playing with a sore knee most of the season. An MRI on Monday
also revealed torn scar tissue and an enlarged bruise in addition to the
loose cartilage.

My View:   Coach Mike Martz called him ""Superman"" last week as he battled
through injuries.  Apparently, he's mortal after all.  The surgery to remove
the loose particles is relatively uninvasive and he should be back in 2-3
weeks.  If you started Faulk, don't be kicking yourself.  There was nothing
you or anyone else could have done.  As of late Sunday afternoon / evening,
he was still the starter.  You can't control last minute scratches when a
player has a problem during pregame warm-ups.  All Faulk owners knew he
wasn't 100% but we all know he's still one of the best RBs in the game even
when dinged up.  Hindsight is 20 / 20. Let it go.

All you can do is move forward.  Let's look at it analytically:

The problem now becomes a matter of timing.  If Faulk comes back according
to schedule, he'll be ready in week 13 or 14.   Most FF leagues play a 14
game regular season with playoffs in weeks 15 and 16 (or 17 if your league
hasn't wised up yet)  This means Faulk will likely miss your regular season
but be available for your Fantasy League Playoffs.

For Teams that own Faulk:  As we predicted, Justin Watson carried the load
for Faulk but he was hardly impressive with 12 yards on 12 carries, although
he did get the TD.  I'd think he'll improve but it's obvious Faulk, not just
the system, is the driving force behind his success.  What I'm saying is
that plugging Watson in is not a situation like Trent Green or Jeff George
stepping in.  Watson struggled and one has to worry about Trung Canidate (if
he ever sheds the candybone label) or Robert Holcombe.  A better option
might be taking a look at some less glamorous RBs that are playing very well
right now like Chicago's James Allen, Buffalo's Sammy Morris or J.R. Redmond
in New England.  If you've got a playoff spot secured, don't panic.  Grab a
lesser RB via trade or free agency and hang on for the playoffs, keeping
your fingers crossed for a quick and full recovery.  If you need a big push
just to make the playoffs, I'd think very hard about dealing Faulk and
shoring up your short term needs.  You have to remember, you've got to MAKE
the playoffs in order to win your Fantasy Bowl.

For Teams who don't own Faulk:  The question you must ask yourself is do you
have depth somewhere that you'd be willing to trade away for Faulk?  If you
seem a lock for the Fantasy Playoffs, it might be a great move.  In other
words, you trade some depth away for an injured Faulk that you know will be
a bench player for you over the next few weeks. In turn, you get Faulk back
just in time for your playoff push.  But you're banking on #1 Making the
playoffs and #2 Faulk being ready by week 14.  Only you can judge your
chances for #1 but from all I'm hearing, #2 seems pretty darn likely.  If
you've got the playoffs spot sewn up, it could be a great move to trade for
Faulk now.  Don't give up too much.  Don't hesitate to let the Faulk owner
know that teammate D'Marco Farr was out of action for a month with a similar
injury and we all know a RB's knee takes much more stress with the cutting
that does a Defensive Tackle's.  Throw in some comments about St. Louis
resting Faulk for the playoffs.

Speaking of the ""resting for the playoff"" factor - You have to look at how
well the Saints are playing.  The Super Bowl  champs are in real danger of
not even winning their own division.  It looks like St. Louis will be
battling to the end of the regular season so while still a possibility, the
Rams resting all their players doesn't seem as likely as it did a month ago.
Another reason you shouldn't give up too much in trading for Faulk.  Make
sure to ""sell"" your position either way based on whether you're a Faulk
owner or not.  If you're trading him away, you want to talk up the Saints
and the tough scenarios if St. Louis loses again (the hot Giants are next on
the road).  St. Louis will be fighting for their lives you'll say.  If
you're dealing for Faulk, obviously, you'll take the other side of the fence
and talk about how Martz is smart and will likely rest Faulk for the
postseason.

The truth, in my opinion, lies closer to the side of Faulk will be pressed
back into service for the regular season.  Assuming the surgery / rehab goes
well of course.  Faulk's one of the tougher guys in the league, so I have no
reason to believe he won't make a normal recovery.

Bottom line is look at this situation going forward.  You can't do anything
about what's happened.  Make it work to your advantage over the next few
weeks.  Good luck!

I'll see you tonight with the Upgrade and Downgrade Player Report.

253,"Dear Santa Claus:

We were good boys and girls last year, so please don't bring us a lump of 
coal again.  If you feel the need to bring us something black, the Saint 
Arnold Winter Stout will be available before Christmas.  If you take them out 
of the six pack, they will fit into our stockings, but please let us know so 
we can reinforce the hooks our stockings hang on.  Here are some other things 
on our Christmas list.  Some are events that we would like all of our friends 
to attend.

What I want for Christmas:

1. A case of Christmas Ale, but please buy it quickly because the distributor 
only has a week of inventory left right now.  That won't last until 
Christmas.  I understand that there may be a deal on it at a large warehouse 
store, but I'm not allowed to tell you where.  Do you remember the name of 
the protagonist of ""Green Eggs and Ham""?

2. All my friends to come to our Toys for Tots Bratwurst Promotion Friday, 
December 8 at the Midtown Station, 2306 Brazos, 713-522-1041.  It is from 
6pm-9pm.  Bring an unwrapped toy.  The Marines will be there (they administer 
the program) to collect the toys for the underprivileged.  Everyone should 
make a point of doing something charitable during the holiday season.  It 
will make you enjoy it even more.

3. A new St. Arnold Wants You t-shirt.  All my friends already have one.

4. All my friends to come to the 6th Annual Celtic Christmas at the Garden in 
the Heights, Sunday, December 17 from 12:00 noon - 11:00 pm.  If you bring 
this email with you, you get a $2 discount off the door price. Regular 
prices: $12.00 at the door, $8.00 advance, children 12 and under are admitted 
free. Entertainment: Seven Nations, The Flying Fish Sailors, Godfreys 
Rangers, Celtic Rebellion Dancers, The Battle of the Oak King & the Holly 
King.

5. A new St. Arnold fishing hat.  You know, the floppy canvas type with an 
embroidered St. Arnold logo on it.  It's the height of fashion.

6. A president-elect.

7. A six-pack of Amber Ale every week of the year.  

8. A (choose one) nubile young lady or strapping young buck to rub scented 
massage oil into my shoulders.

9. A warm St. Arnold sweatshirt to wear on these cold, December nights in 
case you don't bring me number 8.

10. A Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, or Jolly Kwaanza and a Happy New Year.

Love,

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/08/02
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bettis will play in the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. ""There's no question about the next game,"" Bettis said, ""I'll be fine."" Bettis missed Pittsburgh's final five games of the year due to a groin injury, but seems to have healed sufficiently enough to get back into the starting lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=235031&>, RB PHI - The Lie Downs Updated 01/08/02
According to Phillynews.com, Buckhalter will see an increase in playing time behind starter Duce Staley on Saturday against Tampa Bay. Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1140&>, RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 01/08/02
Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. ""He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line),"" Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . ""The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin."" Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries. 

Bills <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. ""My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates,"" Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 01/08/02
Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary. 

Dolphins <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=15&>, DT MIA - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/08/02
Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason. 

Chris Chambers <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=235203&>, WR MIA - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1226&>, WR GB - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns. 

D'Wayne Bates <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. ""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll! s! ee where he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games. 

Jason Brookins <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Not So Nice Machine Updated 01/08/02
Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=187389&>, K OAK - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Cornerback S! ha! wn Springs started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1296&>, WR KC - One Man Show Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown. 

Kurt Warner <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=12797&>, QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/07/02
Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1294&>, WR STL - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1069&>, QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 01/07/02
McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns. 

Tony Banks <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1149&>, RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=187389&>, K OAK - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1262&>, WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1254&>, WR NE - The Fat Bastards Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1511&>, WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 01/07/02
Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. 

Cris Carter <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1248&>, WR MIN - The Executioners Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=12400&>, TE KC - The Executioners Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season.! F! urther tests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1387&>, K JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 01/07/02
Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1335&>, TE IND - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Pollard left Sunday's game against Denver in the third quarter with a sprained left knee. He finished the contest with two catches for 11 yards in the Colts' 29-10 victory. 

James Stewart <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1116&>, RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 01/07/02
Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win. 

Terrell Davis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 01/07/02
According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe."" Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.

Jason Elam <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1383&>, K DEN - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/07/02
According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. ""I've met every goal that I had coming into the season,"" Elam said. ""I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better."" Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

304,"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Please nominate 65,000 MMbtu of gas into the TXU Lone Star Gas pipeline for
the account of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth for the month of
January, 2002.

Enron has a master agreement with Lockheed Martin (Agreement CA 1135).  On
November 8, 2001, Enron executed a 12-month confirmation to deliver gas to
the Lone Star Pipeline for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth.

The agreed upon date for the January 2002 nomination was five days prior to
the beginning of the month.  That date has passed, but Lone Star has
indicated that it will accept a nomination if received by Friday, January 4,
2002.

Please make the nomination.

Also, if you will, please call to let me know that it was made.

I appreciate your help in what must be a most frustrating time for you.

Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough player to start during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs.<BR>

Davis (knee) is listed as probable for Sunday's game. You should have no reservations about starting him against the Chiefs. <BR>

Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth starting at this point. <BR>

Head Coach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Archuleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (hamstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener against Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round selection on Draft Day. <BR>

Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain on the active roster until Sunday. ""I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals,"" Wilkins said. ""It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no tweaks."" <BR>

Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia
may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt
Warner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up
against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box
when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Joe

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Arizona Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Jake Plummer came up small last week with just 144 yards against a hot
Dallas pass Defense.   Surprisingly, David Boston was a non factor with just
26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so there's
nothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

Tim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was
the 12th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning, McNair and
Garcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.   Kevin Johnson, as usual,
was his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved
in the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.   The Titans have
been awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Again,
some people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide - I'm
not saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings for
where we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here
against the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year.


Miami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Jay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally,
Footballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with
124 yards on 7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok
this week.   TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The
Falcons rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

Vinny Testeverde refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs
(with 2 Interceptions) against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary
WR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced
another TD.   The Bills rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

Kurt Warner had an ""off"" day for him with ""just"" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of
course, he's a must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads
the ball around so well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but
I'd have a very hard time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl.
Keep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts
rank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Chicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Marty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes isn't as remarkable until you
realize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.   I guess that makes Booker
the # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.   This team is all about
Anthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not too excited about any of
these guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.   The Lions rank # 22 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Brett Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week.
He's too good to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder
are solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was
earlier this year.   The Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

Manning was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions
last week.   The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's
still one of the leagues best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching
nearly everything in his sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled
over them last week.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Oakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game

It's funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but
that's what's happening.   He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as
along with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing
units in the game.   Charlie Garner is a nice target too.   This week,
they'll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Brad Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207
yards.   Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of
him, I don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the
name of this passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Carolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

Weinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams
were ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4 weeks going into last
week.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as
Muhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee.   The
Cardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Denver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Brian Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the
year so Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver
of note and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and
he's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has
struggled lately on defense ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Brunell had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy
Smith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just
about any league.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

Trent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2
Interceptions.   Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander
did very little.   Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as
his owners would like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues.
The Jaguars rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Stay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call.
The Vikings have imploded.   If Bouman starts, it's much better news for
Moss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target.
Although it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter
because it could've been his last game in Minnesota.   Honestly, it's tough
to sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB.   WRs are
rarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

The Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for
Staley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb.   James Thrash and
Freddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they weren't too
effective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick
a WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big.
They rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Kordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up 3 TDs
last week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly
so.   WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any
team.   Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are
tougher than many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


San Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Doug Flutie was awful early, but made a great recovery to finish with 175
yards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's a lot of talk about letting
Drew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we
would've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either way, Flutie's
probably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of the WRs,
Curtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action
as well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Seattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

Matt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt it'll
start now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren Robinson and
Darrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved
in the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Washington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Tony Banks threw for 236 yards last week in a tough game with Chicago.
Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes
thrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron Felmister saw 6
passes thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus, he's got
a cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Buffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

Van Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1 TD passing game last week.   As usual,
Eric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly.   This week, the
Bills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Dallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

I can't imagine you're in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on
the roster.   Quincy Carter's given me very little to make me think he'll do
much of anything.   Of course, for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey
Galloway can make something happen with just one throw, but they're definite
risks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Detroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Rookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a
rookie QB.   Granted, he's got talent and potential but he's still very
green.   Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw
more balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver.   That's
not unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could
continue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Few people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last
week but that's what happened.   Aaron Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints
tried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats are stats though and Brooks
owners will take them any way they can get them.   Joe Horn and Willie
Jackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again,
Boo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The Redskins rank
# 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Kerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for
338 yards and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with
Joe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have
cooled lately where they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can
cause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins' experience should help him.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Steve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.   He
managed 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the
primary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying
something.   This week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks #
10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Atlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense

Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last
week throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.   Terance Mathis,
Tony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games.
As you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week, they'll
face a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Baltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Elvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He threw for 181
yards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is the
preferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an
impact.   The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

You pretty much have to avoid all these guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153
yards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy accomplishment was a
sideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick was benched
for fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start this
week.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals.
Pittsburgh ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Garcia only had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another)
but he's still a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many
weapons.   Terrell Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai
Streets could be worth a look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in
the passing game.   Dallas ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks so they've been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
Tough matchups but I don't see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless
you're just loaded.   See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see
these guys ranked.

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=1321&""><B>Wesley Walls</B></A>, TE CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=133297&""><B>Martin Gramatica</B></A>, K TB - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>

Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday.

, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week.

He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws.

He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=235174&""><B>Chris Weinke</B></A>, QB CAR - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs.

Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib.

Hi Folks,

I know many of you have early deadlines this week so I juggled my schedule
to get these early.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly
where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive
emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but
listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup
may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start
the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup
one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk,
Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is
meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between
players.

Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.
http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position
numbers are from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith vs Carolina Defense

Smith was upstaged last week by big Bob Christian who looked great on the TD
pass reception and run.   Smith had 43 yards on 19 carries (2.3 ypc)  Keep
an eye on his health as he was nicked in Sunday's game.   Smith has been up
and down but facing this Carolina defense may be what he needs.   The
Panthers are ranked # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If you've been thinking
about starting Smith, this could be the week.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Detroit Defense

Ahman Green was semi quiet running the ball against Atlanta last week
carring 17 times for 62 yards (3.6 ypc)   He'll face a soft defense this
week against the Lions.   Detroit ranks # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last 4 weeks and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.
Green's a sure starter here.


San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Arizona Defense

Everyone keeps talking about the ""rookie wall"" and Tomlinson just keeps
plugging.   Sunday, he posted 68 yards on 22 carries (3.1 ypc) plus a TD.
Not bad.   This week, he faces the soft Cardinal defense that ranks # 23 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 28 for the year
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If Tomlinson's been your guy, I'd
certainly start him again here.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense

Alexander continues to have a bulldog like hold on the starting RB job.
Coach Mike Holmgren is now softening his stance on Ricky Watters' return
saying Watters might be the 3rd down back when he returns.   But even that
seems to be a couple of weeks away.   Alexander is the man.   He'll face a
Chief defense that ranks # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   Alexander has to be licking his chops though at their # 31
ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Baltimore's Jason Brookins vs Jacksonville Defense

Brookins did a nice job last week against Cleveland carrying the ball 21
times for 89 yards (4.2 ypc)   I'd expect him to improve each week as he
gets more comfortable in the role of #1 RB.   He didn't catch any passes so
that's a little bit of a worry.   This week, he faces a Jacksonville Defense
that did a pretty good against Jerome Bettis last week.   They rank # 21 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 11 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.   Watch very closely how the team and self appointed
spokesman Shannon Sharpe handle the Elvis Grbac 4 interceptions thing.
Could lead to a more conservative gameplan with a focus on running the ball
more.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Cleveland Defense

Corey Dillon showed last week why he gets saddled with the inconsistency
rep.   17 carries for 38 yards (2.2 ypc) won't carry your team.   The sad
thing is he's so hard to predict when he'll break out.   This week, he faces
a Cleveland Defense that's ranked # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks so you'd have to think he has a chance.   The Browns
rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs as well.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Minnesota Defense

Thomas didn't make much noise last week with just 58 yards on 23 carries
(2.5 ypc)   Fantasy owners are trying to decide who the real Thomas is.
This week, he'll face a soft Viking defense that ranks # 30 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.   I think we'll see him get back on track.   The Bear passing game will
definitely open up some lanes for him.


Miami's Lamar Smith vs Buffalo Defense

The Lamar Smith woes continue.   He showed glimpses of breaking out but
wound up with 53 yards on 19 carries (2.8 ypc)   I'm not as worried about
Travis Minor stealing too much from him as he only managed 9 yards on 6
carries (1.5 ypc)   This Miami running game has faded quickly.   They'll
face a soft Buffalo defense this week that ranks # 22 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.


New York's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Oakland Defense

Barber looked very good Monday while Dayne was awful.   Barber rushed 8
times for 55 yards plus he caught 4 passes for 52 yards.   Dayne, on the
other hand, rushed 4 times for a whopping minus 3 ypc.   (NEGATIVE 0.8 ypc)
The Raider defense isn't much ranking # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so this is
probably a good matchup.   At least for Barber.   I'd start Dayne at your
own risk until he shows me something.


New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs New England Defense

Start Ricky Williams.   He's rolling.  120 yards on 28 carries (4.3 ypc)
plus another 48 receiving.   The re-emergence of QB Aaron Brooks is a huge
factor and Ricky should keep it up.   New England ranks # 10 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but I wouldn't let that deter
me at all.


San Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Indianapolis Defense

Hearst continued the miracle story with another fine outing last week.   He
had 92 yards on 17 carries plus he caught 6 passes for 21 yards.   He looks
to be too much for Kevan Barlow to overtake at this point.   Barlow did have
7 carries but it looks pretty clear that Hearst is the guy.  The Colt
defense ranks # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Tampa Bay Defense

You don't need me to tell you to start Faulk.   Just do it and count your
blessings that you own one of the best players in the universe.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Arizona's Michael Pittman vs San Diego Defense

Pittman ran pretty hard last week gaining 81 yards on 23 carries (3.5 ypc)
but yielded a TD to Thomas Jones last week.   That's not good.   This
Charger defense is definitely one that can be run on as they rank # 24 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They don't give up
many points though as evidenced by their # 8 ranking for the year in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.   The Arizona offense was clicking last week (albeit
against Detroit) but it's a little unclear as to exactly how Pittman fits
in.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs Atlanta Defense

Huntley was much more involved this past week and showed his owners some
signs of life.   He rushed 13 times for 63 yards (4.8 ypc) and also caught 5
passes.   Encouraging signs.   This week he faces a Falcon defense that
could be primed for a letdown after the big Green Bay win.   They rank # 25
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 15 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Denver Defense

Emmitt actually looked pretty good last week returning from injury to post
80 yards on 15 carries (5.3 ypc)   He was nicked late in the game so check
his status this week but he looks like he'll be ok for Thursday's game.
The Broncos rank # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks but are still pretty strong for the year ranking # 9 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


Denver's Mike Anderson vs Dallas Defense

Anderson posted a whopping 31 yards on 13 carries (2.4 ypc) against the
Redskins last week.   Olandis Gary didn't do any better with 28 yards on 10
carries (2.8 ypc)   At this point, you'd have to say the entire Bronco
offense is in disarray.   WR Rod Smith's injury is a huge factor as they're
simply not the same with him less than 100%.   This week, they face a pretty
good defense in Dallas that ranks # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.   Being a short week will not help matters.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs San Francisco Defense

Dominic Rhodes didn't make anyone forget about Edgerrin James but he did
prove what we all were thinking - Being the # 1 RB for Indy is not a bad
thing.   He got the score and also rolled up 67 yards on 18 carries.   And
he'll likely improve.   Not bad for a guy who probably wasn't drafted in
your league.   The 49er defense is average ranking # 18 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense

After a bye week of rest, Holmes will see how he fares against the Seahawk
defense.   Seattle ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   They're nothing
special but they do a nice job of shutting down Travis Henry and Buffalo
last week.


Oakland's Charlie Garner / Tyrone Wheatley vs New York Giants Defense

Everyone (including me) hoped that Charlie Garner would take advantage of
the opportunity with Wheatley out to show he could be a full time # 1 RB.
Just didn't happen.   Now Wheatley is reportedly back and ready to go and
Garner looks to keep running it between the 20s while Wheatley or Zack
Crockett punch it in at the goalline.   Garner still puts the yards up
though.   Sunday, he rushed for 59 yards and caught another 41.   The Giants
defense ranks # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks
and showed last night they can be vulnerable.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs Philadelphia Defense

Stephen Davis continues to roll up the yards.   Last week, he totaled 84
yards on 23 carries (3.7 ypc)   This week, he faces a decent Eagle defense
that ranks # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and
# 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Tony Banks will likely be back at
QB although Kent Graham did fine.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Buffalo's Travis Henry / Larry Centers vs Miami Defense

Travis Henry looked pretty bad last week.  13 carries for 29 yards (2.2 ypc)
just isn't going to cut it for you.   Throwing 2 fumbles on top of that
could put his playing time in jeopardy.  Sammy Morris and Shawn Bryson are
champing at the bit.   Don't forget about Larry Centers.   He had 66 yards
receiving on 8 passes Sunday and those are likely valuable stats in your
league.   The Dolphin Defense ranks # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks so it'll be no cakewalk.


Cleveland's James Jackson / Ben Gay vs Cincinnati Defense

Jackson was a late scratch from Sunday's game and Ben Gay made the most of
his opportunity.   You gotta love this guy.   He's a very hard runner and
while raw, displayed some nice talent.   I'm guessing Gay's play will be the
best ""rehab"" Jackson could ever receive.   Jackson is reportedly ready to go
against Cincinnati this week.   The Bengals are pretty tough against the run
ranking # 11.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.


New England's Antowain Smith vs New Orleans Defense

Smith struggled against the Rams Sunday night with 36 yards on 15 carries
(2.4 ypc)   I'd expect tough going again this week against the Saints that
rank # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 13
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   New England seems to be coming back to
earth a bit and you know the Tom Brady / Drew Bledsoe thing has to be a
distraction for the team.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs Washington Defense

Any worries Duce Staley owners had about Correll Buckhalter stealing time
went up in smoke last week. (sorry)   Staley looked like the Duce of old
rolling up 102 yards on 26 carries.   He threw in 4 receptions for 31 yards
to boot.   Washington is surprisingly tough against the run ranking # 4 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   It won't be a
cakewalk but still you have to like Staley with the way they're playing now.


Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs Tennessee Defense

Bettis was held very much in check last week with the exception of one 40
yard run.   Even with the big run, his totals of 52 yards on 21 carries (2.5
ypc) weren't much.   Won't be much easier this week against a good Tennesee
defense that ranks # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks.   The Titans shut down Corey Dillon last week who has a similar power
style.   I'd have a hard time not starting Bettis though as he's definitely
the focus of this offense and getting better as QB Kordell Stewart continues
to improve.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Detroit's James Stewart / Lamont Warren / Corey Schlesinger vs Green Bay
Defense

Talk about a muddy situation.   Last week, Lamont Warren, Corey Schlesinger,
and Rueben Droughns each had at least 6 carries.   And just for good
measure, James Stewart is reportedly ready to play this week.   Throw in the
added bonus that Green Bay is very tough and ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   That's enough to make me shy away
from all these guys.   (That and the fact Charlie Batch may throw it 75
times...)


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Baltimore Defense

As we told our readers today, the news isn't good for Fred Taylor.   His doc
is telling him to stay out of the lineup for this week and they're sounding
way too vague for my liking as to when he'll be back.   That probably means
Mack gets the call by default.   He posted a stellar 6 yard on 8 rushes (0.8
ypc) day.   Yes, ZERO point 8.   Elvis Joseph can run back kicks but he only
managed 6 yards on his 3 carries.   And QB Mark Brunell could miss the game
with his leg injury.   All in all, pretty ugly going against the Ravens
Defense who's fallen down to # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks but is still nasty.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Chicago Defense

Bennett got the carries Monday night while Doug Chapman saw no action.
Bennett had 33 yards on 11 carries (3.3 ypc) so you'd have to think he's on
the right track back.   When Culpepper, Moss and Carter play like they did
Monday, it's pretty clear the Vikings won't need a lot from their RB.   This
week he'll face a much tougher opponent in Chicago.   The Bears rank # 5 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and are playing very
well.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so
it'll be a tough matchup coming off a short week.


Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs St. Louis Defense

Dunn and Alstott put up pitiful numbers Sunday.   Dunn had 12 yards on 8
carries (1.5 ypc)   Alstott had 2 yards on 4 carries (0.5 ypc) although he
did get a score.   Granted, it was against a tough Chicago team but that's
awful.   This week, they'll face an injury riddled St. Louis team that ranks
# 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Even with the
injuries, I don't like either of these RBs here.


Tennessee's Eddie George vs Pittsburgh Defense

It's bad when the QB out rushes the # 1 RB but that's what happened last
week.   George put up 61 yards on 23 carries (2.7 ypc) and seemed to take a
step back.   The trouble with him is that his game is so power oriented,
that when the holes aren't there, he simply can't do much.   This week,
it'll be much tougher against the swarming Steeler defense ranked # 1 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They rank # 3 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'm not one for benching your best players
but this is one matchup you'll want to look at very closely.

Clipped from the John Mullin article:

The Bears are preparing to play one of the NFL's poorest defenses against
the run but may face that defense without their No. 1 running back.

Rookie tailback Anthony Thomas is questionable with a strained hamstring
that has bothered him for the last couple of weeks, got a little worse in
the win over Tampa Bay and could eventually cause coaches to hold him out of
a game to let it heal.

Thomas did not practice Wednesday and his status for Sunday night's game at
Minnesota will not be determined until closer to game time.

""I can't say when I really did it,"" Thomas said. ""It just bothered me a
little more at the end and halftime when you rest on it awhile.""

Injuries are part of every week's preparations and players become accustomed
to playing with pain and injury. But with a playoff berth possible, the
Bears may bench Thomas to let the hamstring get closer to full strength.

""We could get there,"" said coach Dick Jauron. ""You definitely don't want to
do that, but any player that's out there that has an injury that causes them
to not only be not as effective as they can be but also risks further
injury, you don't want to expose him to that. We'll just have to monitor
that really closely.""


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


Just passing along.   Realize the Bears are thinking now much further past
just this game.   Dick Jauron knows Anthony Thomas will be a big part of
their playoff success and he may be thinking conservatively here.

  some accounting and billing, but i'm working in the commercial group doing
advertising and support to the engineers for the most part.  the company is

great, we just celebrated 15 years of business last month. it is a small
firm, and many of the staff members are pretty young, i am still the
youngest, however.  i found the job online, and i liked it after the first
interview.

my sisters are doing great, jacqui is a senior at lamar, and dominique is
working towards her last year of school and then she has a year of student
teaching. she has been dating hunter sage for almost 3 years now.  he is in

his first year of law school at UT.  jacqui's boyfriend of a year and 2
months (they celebrated last week) is also a senior at lamar.  really great

guy! i think when i buy the townhouse, dominique will probably move in with

me, her student teaching is unpaid, so she will be looking for a free
place,

332,"How (not) to speak English Properly

1. Verbs HAS to agree with their subjects.
2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.
3. And don't start a sentence with a conjunction.
4. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.
5. Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat)
6. Also, always avoid annoying alliteration.
7. Be more or less specific.
8. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are (usually) unnecessary.
9. Also too, never, ever use repetitive redundancies.
10. No sentence fragments.
11. Contractions aren't necessary and shouldn't be used.
12. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.
13. Do not be redundant; do not use more words than necessary; it's highly
superfluous.
14. One should NEVER generalize.
15. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.
16. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.
17. One-word sentences? Eliminate.
18. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.
19. The passive voice is to be ignored.
20. Eliminate commas, that are, not necessary. Parenthetical words however
should be enclosed in commas.
21. Never use a big word when a diminutive one would suffice.
22. Use words correctly, irregardless of how others use them.
23. Understatement is always the absolute best way to put forth
earth-shaking ideas.
24. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ""I hate quotations.
Tell me what you know.""
25. If you've heard it once, you've heard it a thousand times: Resist
hyperbole; not one writer in a million can use it correctly.
26. Puns are for children, not groan readers.
27. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.
28. Even IF a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.
29. Who needs rhetorical questions?
30. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.

And the last one...

31. Proofread carefully to see if you any words out.",Ralph Waldo Emerson,,

QB Jake Plummer (Ari) should get the start although he is still
hurting a tad with thumb and rib injuries.  He is listed as probable
on the injury report.  His backup Dave Brown is questionable with a
shoulder injury.

QB Doug Johnson (Atl) has been named the starter for the rest of the
season.

QB Trent Dilfer (Bal) is on a bye this week.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is expected to start with sore ribs.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is making excellent progress, but he will likely
miss again this week.  Shane Matthews is expected to get the start
this week.  Cade is listed as questionable with a sore shoulder.  He
would probably play if Matthews were to get hurt.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) is expected to return as the starter despite
a sore knee.  He practiced on Wednesday.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) did not throw on Wednesday as he nurses his
ribs.  The team has not yet named a starter and if he can not go will
look to Spergon Wynn to lead there team into the slaughter.  Either
way, look for Jacksonville's defense to look good in this contest.

QB Clint Stoerner was signed by Dallas this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) is slated to return the last week of the NFL
season at the earliest.  Gus Frerotte will start in his absence.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) was able to practice Tuesday and is expected
to take the field with his sore ribs.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) practiced on Wednesday, but is still questionable
whether he will start.  The coaching staff has yet to name a
starter.  I rate his chances at 85% to start.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) was able to practice Wednesday and now looks
like he will start this Sunday.  He is listed as questionable on the
injury report with a sore shoulder and neck.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding.  He appears as
questionable on the injury report again with a  sore thumb and a
bruised ego.  He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays
hurt.  If he can not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100%
knee) to take the field.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar
play.   He starts again this week.

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) is probable with a sore calf, but expects to
start.

QB Jerome Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more
than that to keep him off the field.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or two for a
more durable body.  He appears on the injured list again as
questionable with a sore knee.  Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin,
will start again in his place.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for the injured Brock
Huard.  Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney and was just
released from the hospital earlier this week.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in
practice.  He will start this week.  Trent Green will back him up.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start against
the Cowboys.  Eric Zeier would play if Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start this
week.  He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a hurt
thumb.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind center while Jeff George
watches.  I doubt we have seen the last of this controversy.

Running backs in the News:

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is gone for the season.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to practice briefly on Wednesday and
is questionable for this week's game.  He is having trouble
making the hard cuts so will likely be ineffective even if he plays.

RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game.

RB Tim Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He
is listed as probable with a sore toe.

RB Jamel White (Cle) is banged up with a sore shoulder.  Look for
Travis Prentice to ""shoulder"" more of the load this week.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) has shaken off the concussion and will start
this week.

RB Terrell Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems.  Mike
Anderson gets the start again this week.

RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his sore thumb.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game.  Ahman Green will get
the start.

RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to be the
starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury report
with a tender hamstring.

RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is probable with a sore hamstring.

RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as questionable on the injury report with
bruised ribs, but he expects to play.

RB Ricky Williams (NO) is healing way ahead of schedule.  He may now
be ready for the last game of the regular season.  His cast is
expected to come off later this week.

RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as questionable on the injury report
with a sore neck.  He is still expected to start though, but Chad
Morton may see a few more reps than usual.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain.  He is
listed as probable with a sore gluteous.  I am guessing he is the
butt of many New York jokes.

RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will return punts.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and finger,
but his ankles are better.  He will play this week.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this week and he is using
the time to look for personalized items with his last name.  We will
keep you posted.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as questionable with a sore hamstring.
On a team that already has a crowded backfield with Jermaine Fazande
and Terrell Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could be placed on the
inactive list this week.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) has a broken rib, but is expected to play
with the pain.

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed as questionable on the injury
report, but is doubtful he would have played anyway.  The team
remains cautious in his comeback.

RB Mike Alstott (TB) will not play this week.  Look for Warrick Dunn
to get plenty of opportunities against a soft Dallas defense.

RB Eddie George (Ten) skipped Wednesday's practice, but expects
to practice today and play this weekend.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as questionable with a sore knee.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his sore forearm.  Look for the
Giants to attempt to arm-tackle him all day.

Wide Receivers in the News:

WR Frank Sanders (Ari) is expected to play with a sore leg.

WR Brian Finneran (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to
play with a sore back.

WR Qadry Ismail (Bal) is on a bye this week.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) will use this week to heal his shoulder he
injured in last week's game.

WR Peerless Price (Buf) is expected to play with a sore ankle.

WR Donald Hayes (Car) is expected to start with a sore groin.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as questionable with a sore
knee.  He did not practice on Wednesday.

WR Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week.  Johnnie Morton and
Herman Moore will start in his absence.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more time on the injury report than
Yancey Thigpen=01(=01(=01(well maybe not, but he can't stay healthy
either.
Corey misses another game this week as he is officially listed as out.

WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and is listed as
questionable on the injury report.  He says he will be ready to play
though.

WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable with a sore toe.  With Tony
Martin now healthy, the team will likely rest OJ so that he can heal
for the playoffs.

WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as questionable on the injury report
with a sore leg, but he expects to play.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than his listing on the
injury report.  Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing good enough
to hold onto the starting jobs even if Jake were to get healthy.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum.  Joe Jurevicius
will start in his place.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start over Laveranues Coles who is out
with a twisted knee.

WR Courtney Hawkins (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee,
but even if he played he would likely be ineffective.  Hines Ward has
been the only Pittsburgh receiver to do anything consistently all
year.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to play, but he keeps talking
like he will be on the field though.  He was quoted in the Sacramento
Bee as saying he is 85% right now.  I am guessing he is closer to
70%, but he probably will play if he can handle the pain from his
turf toe.

WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury.

WR Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this
week.

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring.
Even if he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor.

WR Albert Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his
condition.  He remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to
whether he plays.  The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar
so he may have limited value even if he suits up this week.

WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh, but is expected to play
this week.

Tight Ends in the News:

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to play
with a sore knee.

TE Shannon Sharpe (Bal) is on a bye this week.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is bothered by a sore knee.  Fantasy players are
bothered that he is still mentioned as a player in the NFL.

TE Aaron Shea (Cle) is listed as questionable with sore quadriceps.
He was limited in practice, but expects to play in the game.

TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this
weekend.  He is expected to practice on Thursday and is listed as
questionable on the injury report with a sore knee.

TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and just did not catch a pass
last week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon.  If Grbac plays, expect
him to get the ball to Tony again.

TE Hunter Goodwin (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to
play.

TE Johnny McWilliams (Min) is now the starter.  John Davis still gets
a lot of looks though.

TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow.

///////////////////////////////

Kickers in the News:

PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week.  But he has
looked like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall
minutes before game-time.  Now that the Rams are tied for first
though, expect the players to start working through the pain.  I rate
Wilkins chance to start at close to 90% this week.

We've been downgrading Chicago WR Marcus Robinson already with Shane
Matthews throwing the ball but here's more bad news from my friends at
www.nfltalk.com

http://www.sportstalk.com/nfl/rumors/index.shtml From the article:  The
Chicago Bears have informed NFLtalk that wide receiver Marcus Robinson
suffered a lower back strain with muscle spasms in practice yesterday. He
was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment and observation
last night and was evaluated by Bears team orthopedist Michael Schafer.
Robinson is listed on the Bears injury report as questionable for this
weekend's game with Green Bay and his status will be updated tomorrow.

More as I hear it but right now it's not looking too good.

Thank you for signing your petition to certify the election
at ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Like many Americans, I'm sure you're trying to get the most
accurate, up-to-the-minute information about what's
happening down in Florida.  But can you really trust the
information you get from the liberal media?

In fact, the liberal media has been behind this election
controversy from the beginning.

That's why I'm passing on to you this letter I received
from my friend Jim Roberts at Radio America.

Radio America is doing something about this attempt by the
liberal media to hijack the election.  I urge you to take
just a minute to read Jim's letter and to listen to Radio
America over the internet for unbiased election coverage.

For Election Integrity,

tad with thumb and rib injuries.? He is listed as probable  on the injury 
report.? His backup Dave Brown is questionable with a  shoulder injury.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) is expected to return as the starter  despite a sore 
knee.? He practiced on Wednesday.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Scott Mitchell  (Cin)?looked good again in practice 
Friday and is now  probable.? He'll likely get the start which is good news 
for his  teammates.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) did not throw on Wednesday as he nurses  his ribs.? 
The team has not yet named a starter and if he can not go will  look to 
Spergon Wynn to lead there team into the slaughter.? Either way,  look for 
Jacksonville's defense to look good in this contest.
?
*** Saturday Update? Cleveland QBs.? Coach Chris  Palmer will reportedly wait 
until gametime to decide between QBs Doug Pederson  and Spergon Wynn.? What a 
choice.? I'm fairly confident you're not  starting either if you're with me 
still in week 14...

QB Clint Stoerner  was signed by Dallas this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) is slated to return  the last week of the NFL season at 
the earliest.? Gus Frerotte will start  in his absence.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) was able to practice Tuesday and  is expected to take

rate his chances at 85% to  start.

will start this Sunday.? He is listed as questionable on the injury  report

good as he ever looks) in practice and looks to start  Sunday.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding.? He  appears as 
questionable on the injury report again with a? sore thumb and a  bruised 
ego.? He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays  hurt.? If he can 
not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100% knee)  to take the field.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) practiced again  Friday and looks to 
be ok.? I doubt he'll be 100% for the rest of the  season but he's apparently 
able to manage the pain and limitation from the  thumb.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar  play.?? 
He starts again this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Aaron Brooks (NO) has a shot  at unseating Jeff Blake 
for the 2001 starter in New Orleans according to ESPN's  Chris Mortensen.? So 
besides the obvious playoff situation, he's playing  for stakes that extend 
past this season.? 

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit)  is probable with a sore calf, but expects to 
start.? 

QB Jerome  Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more than that

He will start  this week.? Trent Green will back him up.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Kurt Warner (StL) will likely be  playing on a less 
than optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking 
at possible snow.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start against the 
Cowboys.? Eric Zeier would play if  Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start this week.?

ankles are better.? He will play this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Napoleon Kaufman (Oak)  tweaked his hamstring

and looks improved. If he is limited,  this?increases the workload Wheatley 
will see and could open the door for  newly signed Terry Kirby.

*** Saturday Update RB Stephen Davis (Was) certainly  sounds like he's sure 
to play this week.? Although it has to be noted he  sounded like that last 
week.? While I feel pretty good that he'll play, the  worry here is one good 
shot to the arm could really have an effect.?

Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour"" which 
will be paid for by Brian ""The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12""

European Travel Tip
?

When travelling to the U.K. with your hair dryer, electric shaver,  etc., 
don't forget to buy an adapter to fit in the U.K. sockets  before you leave 
home - or at latest in the airport upon arrival.  You are unlikely to find 
these adapters commonly available anywhere  else in the U.K. Adapters are 
available in all electrical shops,  but these are for U.K. appliances to fit 
non U.K. sockets, i.e.,  for when U.K. citizens are travelling outside of the 
U.K. Don't  forget that U.K. voltage is 240 volts - it will fry your 110 
volt  appliance without the correct transforming adapter. -Old Mill Private  
Hotel

I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions 
on EOL ""Force Majeure"" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon 
Katy Plant and were wondering the ""Force Majeure"" ramifications of the the 
Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that 
instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language?  
Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool 
and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these 
pooling zones.  

I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this 
information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.


Thanks in advance.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Dixon was suspended for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh for missing a team 
meeting earlier in the week. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the 
season.   

 Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Greisen replaced an injured Dave Brown in the third quarter of Sunday's game 
at Jacksonville. The second-year quarterback completed 4-of-7 passes for 46 
yards and a touchdown in his short appearance in the game. With the 
Cardinals' season lost, Greisen could get some serious playing time in 
Arizona's last two games, but he is still not a viable Fantasy option at this 
point in the season.    

 Dave Brown , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown started for the injured Jake Plummer against the Jacksonville Jaguars 
on Sunday. He was ineffective for the most part, throwing for only 135 yards 
and an interception before leaving the game with a bruised right index 
finger. Whether it is Plummer, Brown or Chris Greisen under center for 
Arizona next week, it is imperative to avoid any Cardinals' quarterback at 
this point in the season.      

 Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Plummer, still suffering from bruised ribs, missed Sunday's game against the 
Jaguars. He was replaced in the starting lineup by Dave Brown. The Cardinals 
face off against the Ravens and their top-rated defense next week, so even if 
Plummer is healthy, he shouldn't be considered a starter for your Fantasy 
team.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00 
 McNabb was brilliant in Sunday's blowout win over the Browns.  He threw for 
390 yards and four touchdowns, proving that he is not strictly a running 
quarterback. It was one of McNabb's best all-around performances, and it 
likely helped many Fantasy owners advance in their league's playoffs. 
Unfortunately for those same owners, McNabb and the Eagles have a late season 
bye next week, so you will need to look elsewhere for a quarterback in your 
quest for the Fantasy championship.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Seahawks' defense lost three players to injury in Sunday's loss to the 
Broncos. Safety Jay Bellamy (lower back cramps), defensive end Lamar King 
(shoulder) and defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy (thumb) all left the game with 
various injuries. At this point of the Fantasy season, you should avoid 
starting the Seahawks' defense at all costs.    

 Jets , DT NYJ - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jets' defense put up a good fight against the Raiders on Sunday night, 
but were hurt by turnovers which kept them on the field for a good portion of 
the game. The 31 points they gave up to Oakland was only one more than the 
total points they had allowed in the previous three weeks. Expect a better 
performance next week against the Lions - especially if the weather is cold 
at the Meadowlands. On the injury front, defensive lineman Rick Lyle broke 
his leg against the Raiders and will be lost for the season.     

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Aikman left Sunday's game against the Redskins with yet another concussion.  
He looked dazed on the sidelines and is reportedly still suffering from 
dizziness and other symptoms caused by concussions. With only two games 
remaining in the season, don't be surprised if Aikman has seen his last snap 
of the year - and maybe his career. Fantasy owners need to look elsewhere 
than Dallas to find a quarterback worthy of starting during their playoffs.   

 Ray Lucas , QB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Lucas replaced an injured Vinny Tesatverde (groin) in the third quarter of 
Sunday's game at Oakland. Chad Pennington also saw action at QB in the game's 
final quarter.  

 Torry Holt , WR STL - Meximullets Updated 12/10/00 
 On nine catches, Holt racked up 172 yards. With Kurt Warner returning to 
form, Holt should be able to maintain a high level of play during the final 
rounds of the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00 
 Though he completed just 12 of 28 passes, Brooks passed for 203 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions, and also ran 11 times for 108 yards. 
Brooks has suddenly emerged as a surprising two-way threat just in time for 
the Fantasy playoffs.       

 Jacquez Green , WR TB - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/10/00 
 The Tampa Bay wideout failed to record a catch against Miami. After some 
early-season heroics, Green has proved he doesn't deserve to start on any 
Fantasy team during the postseason.      

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - The Snake Pit Updated 12/10/00 
 With the Jets trailing 21-0, Testaverde injured his groin and was replaced 
by Ray Lucas in the third quarter of Sunday night's game at Oakland. Lucas 
threw an interception on his first drive and was briefly replaced by Chad 
Pennington on the Jets' next possession before finishing the series.   

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 12/10/00 
 The Packers' quarterback completed just 15 of 36 passes for 208 yards with 
one touchdown, one interception and a lost fumble. If you advance to the next 
round, you may want to sit Favre, who has run hot and cold during Green Bay's 
recent resurgence.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - FDIC Updated 12/10/00 
 Topping 1,000 yards for the season, Allen ran for 97 yards and a touchdown 
on 37 carries. He also caught a TD pass. Allen played well against the lowly 
Patriots, but you still might not be able to consistently depend on him as a 
Fantasy starter during the postseason.    

 Darnell Autry , RB PHI - Meximullets Updated 12/10/00 
 Despite scoring the Eagles' initial touchdown, Autry ran for just 28 yards 
on 10 carries. Newly-signed Chris Warren did not play, but Autry certainly 
feels Warren's shadow looming over him and might see his playing time 
seriously slip in the final two games.  

 Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Mean Machine Updated 12/10/00 
 The rookie back picked up just 20 yards on 11 carries. Don't trust him 
during these important final weeks. Dayne has been much too inconsistent this 
season.  

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Ramiro Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 150 yards and a touchdown. Smith looked like he 
was in his prime, evading tacklers, pushing them over and exploding away from 
them. He still has the tools to be an integral part of a Fantasy title team.  

 Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ramiro Updated 12/10/00 
 On 11 carries, Pittman ran for minus one yard. If Jake Plummer continues to 
battle injuries, opponents will tee off on Pittman. Thomas Jones also looked 
good in garbage time and very well could see more playing time in the final 
two games.  

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00 
 On six catches, Dawkins finished with 85 yards and a pair of touchdowns. As 
expected, he took advantage of the awful Denver secondary but he is still not 
a reliable starter during the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Risk Managers Updated 12/10/00 
 While running for 89 yards on 17 carries, Richardson added eight catches for 
56 yards. He should keep the starting halfback job in Kansas City for the 
season's final two games.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 12/10/00 
 Reaching the end zone on the ground and through the air, George ran 24 times 
for 81 yards and a touchdown, while catching four passes for 20 yards and two 
more scores. George will definitely be the MVP of many Fantasy championship 
teams this year.   

 Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Murder Inc. Updated 12/10/00 
 The Jaguars' wideout caught eight passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. He 
appears to be rasing his level of play just in time for the final rounds of 
the Fantasy playoffs.      

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Kaufman left Sunday's game against the Jets in the second quarter after 
injuring his right knee. He was taken to the locker room for further 
examnination.  

 David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 On seven catches, Patten racked up 103 yards and a touchdown. Patten has 
showed signs of promise this year, but has lacked consistency when 
healthy.      

 Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - The Rounders Updated 12/10/00 
 The veteran tight end caught just one pass for seven yards. Trent Dilfer 
appears to be speading the ball among many WRs, and Sharpe has suddenly 
become a non-factor in the Baltimore offense.   

 Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - FDIC Updated 12/10/00 
 In a valiant effort, Bledsoe completed 26 of 45 passes for 225 yards with 
two touchdowns and no interceptions. The veteran QB might continue to perform 
well in New England's final two games.   

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/10/00 
 On 23 carries, Smith ran for 79 yards and the Dolphins' lone touchdown. 
Despite facing the Tampa Bay run defense, Smith did not let his owners down 
at a crucial time of year.   

 Corey Dillon , RB CIN - The Rounders Updated 12/10/00 
 On 18 carries, Dillon picked up only 42 yards. The Cincinnati RB still has a 
tendency to disappear against the league's better defenses.  

 Ryan Wetnight , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 
 Wetnight suffered a concussion in Sunday's win over Detroit.

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 The Warriors put Mills on the injured list on Tuesday with an inflamed rig=

 Adonal Foyle , C GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Foyle was activated on Tuesday night in time for Golden State's game again=
st=20
Portland. He had been on the injured list after having surgery to repair to=

ligaments in his right ring finger. Foyle averaged 2.9 points and 4.4=20
rebounds in 16 games as a starter for the Warriors. Foyle has no Fantasy=20
value at this point. =20

 Chris Crawford , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Crawford was placed on the injured list Tuesday with a sprained left ankle=
=20
and a sore right big toe. He is averaging 4.5 points in 19 games, and has n=
o=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Rod Strickland , G WAS - Fear Updated 12/12/00=20
 Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of=
=20
his hamstrings. He is expected to play on Wednesday when the Wizards host=
=20
Allen Iverson and the Sixers. Strickland is averaging 14.5 points and 7.2=
=20
assists per game for Fantasy owners this season, numbers which could be a=
=20
great deal better if he wasn't stuck in Washington.  =20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/12/00=20
 Wallace, who missed Saturday night's game against Detroit because of a=20
injured right wrist, practiced on Monday with his wrist taped. He is close =
to=20
100 percent and is expected to play against Golden State on Tuesday night.=
=20
Fantasy owners who rolled the dice and played Wallace this week will be hap=
py=20
that they did - Golden State's frontcourt has been decimated by injuries an=
d=20
will be easy prey for Wallace.  =20

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He =
is=20
scheduled to have X-rays taken on the ankle on Tuesday, and won't be eligib=
le=20
to return to action until Dec. 19. He is averaging 8.1 points and 8.2=20
rebounds per game this season, and has marginal value in the world of=20
Fantasy.  =20

 James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's=
=20
game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel.=
=20
""The team got together and discussed some things,"" said Posey, ""and=20
(protesting) is what the conclusion was (Monday)."" Reports out of Denver sa=
y=20
that the probems between the coach and his players escolated when Issel=20
ripped Nuggets' center Raef LaFrentz after a recent loss to the Boston=20
Celtics. If the protest does in fact take place, Fantasy owners will miss a=
=20
night of production from some of their Denver players.  =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The=
=20
Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right kne=
e,=20
and team officials are saying that he came off the injured list too soon. T=
he=20
Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for=
=20
their game against Dallas on Tuesday night. With Andre Miller at the point,=
=20
neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value.  =20

 Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left=20
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.=
=20
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how=20
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. ""The=20
shoulder's still attached to my body,"" said Henderson. ""No question I'll=20
play.""  Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one o=
f=20
Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about=
=20
Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he i=
s=20
still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a=
=20
smart move. =20

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Haw=
ks=20
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where h=
e=20
has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of=20
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more=20
natural small forward position. Before his injury, Jackson was Atlanta's=20
leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth=
 a=20
roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid=
=20
replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.   =20

 Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00=20
 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,=
=20
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had=
=20
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, bu=
t=20
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluation=
s=20
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and=20
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.    =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will underg=
o=20
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expecte=
d=20
to miss 6-8 weeks.  Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wi=
se=20
to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viab=
le=20
alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.  =
=20

 Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is=
=20
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 reboun=
ds=20
per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value. =20

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter afte=
r=20
aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coac=
h=20
Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday.=
=20
Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once=
=20
again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00=20
 In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a=
=20
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds=
=20
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the=20
field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury =
-=20
which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their=
=20
lineup.   =20

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him =
to=20
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  =
He=20
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of h=
is=20
$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy=
=20
league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go =
by=20
total points.    =20

 Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for=20
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if=20
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of=
=20
his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if=
=20
possible.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =
=20
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=
c.=20
20 ""at the latest"".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up=
. =20
Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=
=20
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a ""leave"" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful 
except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for 
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride 
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the 
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because 
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for 
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of 
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no 
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which 
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was 
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline 
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us 
to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that 
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible 
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this 
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on 
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.  
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my 
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.  
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed 
our connection we were forced to spend a combined 
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, 
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead 
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten 
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of 
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again 
because of this experience.

For your research I provide the following data:

Louisville courtship of Rockets in jeopardy

June 13, 2000 1:42 p.m. ET

HOUSTON =01* The bid by Louisville, Ky., to land the Houston Rockets appear=

Jefferson County in Kentucky on Monday declined to join a three-pronged=20
proposal that would publicly finance a downtown basketball arena.

that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's 
tax cuts going to the ""wealthiest one percent"".   That is the biggest load of 
garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the 
math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to 
the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut,

1
STATEMENT FROM SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER III

The American people voted on November 7.  Governor George W.
Bush won 31 states with a total of 271 electoral votes.  The
vote in Florida was very close, but when it was counted,
Governor Bush was the winner.

Now, three days later, the vote in Florida has been recounted.
Over two-thirds of the state election supervisors overseeing
the recount are Democrats.

At the end of this recount, Governor Bush is still the winner,
subject only to counting the overseas ballots, which have
traditionally favored the Republican candidate.  No evidence of
vote fraud either in the original vote or in the recount has
been presented.

Now the Gore campaign is calling for yet another recount in
selective and predominantly Democratic counties where there
were unexplained large vote swings in their favor in the
recount.

It appears that the Gore campaign is attempting to unduly
prolong the country's national Presidential election through
endless challenges to the results of the vote here in Florida.

Furthermore, the more often ballots are recounted, especially
by hand, the more likely it is that human errors, like lost
ballots, and other risks, will be introduced.  This frustrates
the very reason why we have moved from hand counting to
machine counting.

Let me say a word specifically about the Palm Beach ballot.
There is a rule of law to be followed for elections.  The state
of Florida has established legal procedures to design, approve,
publish and, if need be, to protest ballots before the election.
The ballot was designed by a Democratic elections supervisor.
She approved it.  The Democratic Party did not question it
before the election.  This ""butterfly""-type ballot was used in
recent elections in the same county under the same rules.  Again,
the Democrats did not complain.  The overwhelming majority of
voters who used the ballot understood it and cast valid votes.
Our lawyers have confirmed the legality of this ballot, and we
have copies of the relevant Florida statute available for you
to see.

The Gore campaign has also tried to make a lot of the fact that
double marked ballots are not counted.  A key principle in
America is one person, one vote.  If we have ballots with two
votes, of course we cannot count them or guess about them.
Ballots that are double-marked can't be evidence of the voter's
intent to vote one way or another.  No jurisdiction in the
United States would accept such a ballot as a valid vote, and
Florida law specifically does not.  It happens in every
precinct in every election.  And the procedure is clear:  These
ballots must be disregarded.

We understand, and I understand personally, that it is
frustrating to lose by a narrow margin.  But it happens.  It
happened to the Republican Presidential candidates in 1960 and
1976.  Both Vice President Nixon and President Ford put the
country's interest first.  They accepted the vote for the good
of the country.

It is important that there be some finality to the election
process.  What if we insisted on recounts in other states that
are very close?  For example, in Wisconsin, Iowa, (and if we
don't win) New Mexico.

Let the country step back a moment, pause, and think about
what's at stake.  This may be the last chance.  There is no
reasonable end to this process if it slips away.

The purpose of our national election is to establish a
""Constitutional government,"" not unending legal wrangling.  We
will therefore vigorously oppose the Gore campaign's efforts to
keep recounting until it likes the result.  For the good of the
country and the sake of our standing in the world, the
campaigning should end, and the business of an orderly
transition should begin.

_________________________________________________________________

STATEMENT FROM BUSH COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR KAREN HUGHES:

""The vote count on Tuesday night showed Governor Bush won
Florida's election, and a recount has now confirmed his victory.
The only votes left to be counted are the overseas absentee
ballots, which in the past have favored Republican candidates.
Bob Dole carried the overseas ballots in Florida in 1996 by a
margin of 54 to 40 percent, even though he lost the election in
Florida.  We hope Vice President Gore and his campaign will
reconsider their threats of lawsuits or still more recounts,
which could undermine the constitutional process of selecting a
President and has no foreseeable end.""

DEMOCRATS URGE GORE TO QUIT LEGAL WRANGLING

""Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, questioned the
Gore campaign's wisdom in challenging the Palm Beach result.
The right thing, Mr. Breaux said, 'is to count the votes and
respect the decision,' without lengthy litigation. And Senator
Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, warned against
getting mired in the courts...

""'I want Al Gore to win the election,' Mr. Torricelli told
reporters, 'but more than that, I want somebody to win this
election. There is going to have to be a very compelling case
for anybody to take this into a court of law.'""
- The New York Times' R. W. Apple, Jr., 11/10/00

_________________________________________________________________

NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST, OTHERS: REVOTE OR COURT REMEDY
POLITICALLY UNSOUND AND LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE

""The problem is that potential remedies, such as a new election
in Palm Beach County, seem politically unsound and legally
questionable. The sad reality is that ballot disputes and
imperfections are a feature of every election. It will poison
the political atmosphere if presidential elections, in
particular, come to be seen as merely a starting point for
litigation.""
- New York Times, Editorial, 11/10/00
http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/10/opinion/10FRI1.html


""We say yes to counting a little more, but the legal action
about which Mr. Daley spoke elliptically should be approached
with enormous caution and restraint. Absent more than is
currently known, our sense is that either a lawsuit or a repeat
vote would raise at least as many questions as it would likely
resolve; the courts in the end can't legitimize the results.""
- Washington Post, Editorial, 11/10/00
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57302-2000Nov9.html


""Some folks are even calling for a rerun of the Florida
election.  It is important to decide this election by the rules
that 100 million Americans understood -- or should have
understood -- when they entered the voting booth Tuesday.  This
is not just about fair play for Al Gore and George W. Bush. It
is about defending a system that regards voting-day verdicts as
the final word, a concept that distinguishes this nation from
most others in the world.""
- San Francisco Chronicle, Editorial, 11/9/00


""'You know, I don't think the ballot was a problem, Bill and
I'll tell you why-is that there's one section I don't know if
people are really looking at, which relates to electronic or
electromechanical voting.  And in that particular case, what
the law says down here, it says 'Voting squares may be placed
in front of or in back of the names of candidates and
statements.'""
- CNN's ""Crossfire,"" Greta Van Susteren,  11/09/00


""If you start saying the ballot should be thrown out because
of confusion, I think that cases like that could be brought all
over the country.""
- CNN's Larry King Live, Bill Schneider, 11/8/00

 Murray sat out practice Thursday with a sprained left knee but is expected 
to play against Toronto Friday.  Look for Matt Harpring to start at small 
forward if Murray is unable to play.    

 P.J. Brown , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Brown sat out Thursday's game due to a strained left achilles.  He is 
expected to play in Saturday's road game against the Knicks.    

 Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/10/00 
 Mutombo scored 15 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in his first game of the 
season Thursday.  He had missed the first five games and most of the 
preseason with a case of Malaria.    

 Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/10/00 
 Sprewell missed Wednesday's game against Cleveland and will sit out Friday's 
matchup against the Celtics.  Glen Rice will start at small forward for the 
Knicks in his absence.    

 Chris Childs , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Childs left Wednesday's game against the Cavaliers with a bruised right 
hamstring.  He limped to the locker room with his leg heavily wrapped in 
ice.  He is listed as day-to-day.  Erick Strickland will backup Charlie Ward 
at point guard if Childs is unable to play.  

 Dan Majerle , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Majerle will try to run at practice today and is not sure whether he will be 
ready to return Saturday.  He has missed the first four games of the season 
with a hamstring injury.          

 Eric Williams , F BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Head coach Rick Pitino has moved Paul Pierce to small forward so Williams 
will now come off the bench for the Celtics.  He is averaging 4.0 points and 
2.3 rebounds per game.    

 Paul Pierce , F BOS - Fear Updated 11/10/00 
 In a move to prevent Pierce and Antoine Walker from being double-teamed, 
head coach Rick Pitino has inserted Bryant Stith and Rick Brunson into the 
starting lineup.  Stith will play shooting guard and Pierce will move to 
small forward.  This move shouldn't affect Pierce when playing against teams 
in the Eastern Conference but could influence his numbers when he plays 
against the taller small forwards in the West.     

 Bryant Stith , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Stith will make his debut as the Celtics' starting shooting guard Friday 
against the Knicks.  Paul Pierce will move to small forward.  Stith is a good 
shooter and a dependable scorer but has been injury prone in his NBA 
career.    

 Rick Brunson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Brunson will start at point guard for the Celtics Friday.  But he may give 
way to Chris Herren on Saturday when he is activated from the injury list.  
Keep an eye on Brunson.  Although he is not a prolific scorer he is a good 
passer and a solid defender.  He may be a solid Fantasy pickup within the 
next few weeks.     

 Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Williams was back in action Thursday against the Grizzlies.  He sat out 
Tuesday's game against the Lakers due to a mild knee sprain.  Williams showed 
no effects from the injury Thursday hitting 4-of-5 three-point attempts and 
scoring 13 points.    

 Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Harris played in his first game of the season Thursday against the Pistons.  
He had been sidelined since the beginning of training camp with a hernia.  
Harris scored five points in 12 minutes against Detroit.    

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Gill sat out Thursday's game against the Pistons because of a sore knee.  
Stephen Jackson moved from small forward to shooting guard and Aaron Williams 
moved into the starting lineup at forward in his absence.  Gill is expected 
to return to action in time for Saturday's home game against Seattle.    

 Ben Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Wallace played against the Nets Thursday despite suffering from an injured 
left leg.  He scored six points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 31 minutes of 
playing time.  

 Muggsy Bogues , G TOR - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 Bogues will have arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on Friday, which 
will sideline him for up to six weeks. He has been scratched from each of 
Toronto's last four games while the severity of the injury was determined.    
 

 Joe Smith , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/10/00 
 An arbitrator upheld commissioner David Stern's initial ruling on Thursday, 
stripping Smith of his Larry Bird rights.  Players with Bird rights can 
re-sign with their team even if the team is over the salary cap. Smith will 
have to play three more seasons to re-earn those rights.  Smith will probably 
sign with another team now.  The Timberwolves can offer Smith a one-year 
contract for no more than $611,000. Other teams, including the Miami Heat and 
Chicago Bulls, can offer Smith more than six times that amount.     

 Jelani McCoy , C SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 The elevation of Pervis Ellison to backup status has moved McCoy even 
further down in the Sonics' frontcourt rotation.  Head coach Paul Westphal 
decided to go with Ellison in hopes of preventing turnovers.  McCoy was 
behind former backup Ruben Wolkowyski but is now the last man in a 
five-player rotation.  McCoy is a good shot-blocker and a solid rebounder but 
his lack of offensive skills has hurt his push for playing time.       

 Pervis Ellison , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Ellison is questionable for Thursday's game at Charlotte due to a case of 
the flu.  He served as Ewing's backup in Wednesday's game at Miami.  ""Never 
Nervous"" Pervis entered the game at the end of the first quarter and promptly 
grabbed a rebound and scored.  He did not return after the first quarter, 
suffering from flu-like symptoms.    

 Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/09/00 
 Cummings will be out for at least a month after suffering  a fractured 
cheekbone.  He had plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone earlier this 
week.  Vinny Del Negro will be the backup point guard in his absence.      

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 McDyess played only 11 minutes in the second half of Wednesday's game 
against the Timberwolves due to a stiff back.  He finished the game with 11 
points.  This seems like it will be an ongoing situation with McDyess.  It is 
not known whether he will play in Thursday's game at Portland.  Monitor his 
situation closely.  

 Terry Porter , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 It appears that the cagey veteran is out of the Spurs' regular rotation.  
Porter has played a total of 24 minutes this season.  His minutes have 
gradually decreased since the start of the season and he hasn't played in the 
last two games.  It seems that Steve Kerr is now ahead of Porter in the 
rotation of reserve guards.    

 Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Reserve swingman Jaren Jackson is suffering from an ankle injury and is 
listed as day-to-day.  He sat out Wednesday's game against the Lakers.    

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Someone must have slipped ""The Man of Steel"" some kryponite before 
Wednesday's game against the Spurs.  Shaq grabbed 17 rebounds but only scored 
13 points.  He still put up decent Fantasy numbers but had a bad game in 
terms of points.  No need for Fantasy owners to panic, he should score easily 
in upcoming games against Denver and Houston.    

 Brian Grant , F MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 
 Grant had a monster game against the Sonics Wednesday scoring 30 points and 
grabbing 21 rebounds.  He is doing his best to fill the void left in the 
middle by Alonzo Mourning.  So far Grant isn't doing a bad job, averaging 
20.0 points and 13.5 rebounds per game.    

 Desmond Mason , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 
 Mason had four points in Seattle's 87-81 loss to the Heat Wednesday.  He 
beat out Brent Barry for the starting shooting guard job in the preseason but 
is averaging a mere 4.6 points per game and is shooting 32 percent from the 
field.  Barry is currently suffering from a sprained ankle and hasn't played 
yet this season but he may get his job back when he returns.     

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/09/00 
 Fortson continued his exceptional play this season by grabbing 14 rebounds 
and scoring 17 points against the Kings Wednesday.  He has exceeded the 
expectations of many this season averaging 15.8 points and 15.0 rebounds per 
game.  With numbers like that he is definitely a keeper in any Fantasy 
league.    

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 
 Stojakovic continued his excellent play in the early part of the season by 
scoring 27 points in Wednesday's game.  He is averaging 18 ppg so far, a 
major increase from his 11.9 average in 1999-2000.

438,"Another storm pounds Telluride!

Short of hand-counting each snowflake that has fallen in Telluride, resort 
officials have projected that nearly 4 feet of snow has blanked the area in 
the past three weeks. 9 inches of fresh snow fell overnight to the 
overwhelming joy of town residents. Resort officials are reporting a 29-inch 
base on the mountain, with more than a week to go before the ski area opens 
to skiers and snowboarders.

""Gearing up for one of the resort's best openings in recent history ranks up 
there, as far as current events, with finding out who our next Presidnet will 
be,"" said Steve Swenson, vice president of sales, marketing and air service 
for the Telluride Ski & Golf Company.

 Latest NBA Player News 

 Lee Nailon , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 The Hornets activated Nailon from the injured list today after placing Otis 
Thorpe on the injured list. Nailon has been out since the start of the season 
with right ankle tendinitis.  

 Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Thorpe was placed on the injured list by the Hornets today with a strained 
left foot. He had played in six of Charlotte's eight games this season, 
posting a 3.0 ppg average and a season-best eight points against New Jersey 
on November 4.  

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Dudley left Thursday's game with a sprained left ankle 3 1/2 minutes into 
the contest and did not return.  He could be sidelined for up to three 
weeks.  Daniel Santiago will probably start at center in his absence.     

 Chris Webber , F SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/16/00 
 Webber did not practice Wednesday due to a sprained left ankle, and is 
doubtful for Thursday's game.  He did not play in the Kings' win over the 
Orlando Magic on Tuesday night.  Scott Pollard will start at power forward if 
Webber is unable to play.      

 Raef LaFrentz , C DEN - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 LaFrentz is suffering from a contusion on his left hand and is questionable 
for Thursday's game against Chicago. If LaFrentz can't play Keon Clark will 
start at center. LaFrentz has been inconsistent this year averaging 10.3 
points and 6.6 rebounds per game but is still one of the better Fantasy 
centers.    

 Eduardo Najera , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Najera has had a diminished role with the Mavericks since starting at small 
forward in the season opener.  Dallas has sinced moved Greg Buckner into the 
starting lineup at shooting guard and placed Michael Finley at small forward 
in Najera's place.  Najera played a season-low 10 minutes against the Suns 
Wednesday.  He may be re-inserted into the starting lineup to shake things 
up.  Dallas has lost three out of its last five games.    

 Michael Finley , F DAL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/16/00 
 Finley's shooting woes continued against Phoenix Wednesday.  He scored seven 
points and shot 3-for-16 from the field.  In the past four games, Finley has 
made just 33 percent of his shots.  His current slump could be attributed to 
the fact that he played small forward in those games.  He played well against 
San Antonio, matching up with the 6-7 Sean Elliott but struggled to get his 
shot off against taller more athletic small forwards in the next three games 
against Peja Stojakovic, Lamar Odom, and Shawn Marion.  It may be wise to 
stay away from Finley until he regains his shooting touch or moves back to 
shooting guard.        

 Darius Miles , F LAC - Farragut Academy Updated 11/16/00 
 Miles did not play in Wednesday's game against the Knicks.  Head coach Alvin 
Gentry chose to go with a more experienced lineup and started Tyrone Nesby at 
shooting guard.  Keep and eye on this situation.  This could lead to a 
diminished role for Miles.    

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 During the offseason he was touted as a potential savior for the Suns at the 
center position, but has been a major bust.  Tsakalidis still needs more time 
to develop and has played in only half of the Suns games so far.  If you 
drafted Tsakalidis you may want to give up on him for now and add a center 
that plays on a regular basis.    

 Shawn Marion , F PHO - The Old School Fools Updated 11/16/00 
 Marion had a monster game against the Warriors Wednesday.  He scored 19 
points, grabbed 19 rebounds, and blocked five shots.  Marion has been a major 
sleeper in the early part of the season, averaging 19.0 points and 10.6 rpg.  
If you have him on your Fantasy team hold on to him and start him.    

 Antawn Jamison , F GS - The Old School Fools Updated 11/16/00 
 Jamison started at small forward for Golden State Wednesday matching up 
against Minnesota's Wally Szczerbiak.  He started at power forward in the 
game prior to that.  Jamison will alternate at the forward spots until 
starting power forward Danny Fortson returns from his foot injury.  His 
scoring will remain about the same but look for Jamison to grab more rebounds 
at the power forward position.    

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/16/00 
 McGrady suffered a strained right hip in Tuesday night's game against the 
Kings.  He spent much of Wednesday getting treatment, which will continue 
today before a decision on his availability for tonight's game is made. ""If I 
had to guess now,"" said McGrady, ""I'd say I'm going to try and play...we'll 
see.""    

 Eddie Jones , G MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/16/00 
 Jones missed last night's game in New Jersey with a strained calf.  He 
suffered the injury in the fourth quarter on Tuesday night against the 
Hornets. He considers himself ""day to day.""   

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/16/00 
 Rose sat out of Wednesday night's game against Detroit after the team's 
medical personnel had determined that his injured left wrist was not yet 
sufficiently healed.  Rose, who was expected to play in the game, will now 
likely wait until sometime next week to return to action.    

 Mark Bryant , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 The Cavaliers today waived Bryant, a 12-year veteran who had not appeared in 
a game this season. The 35-year-old forward-center had been on the injured 
list since October 30 with patellar tendinitis in his knees.  

 Randy Livingston , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Livington was signed by the Golden State Warriors today after they placed 
Danny Fortson on the injured list. The 25-year-old was a free agent after 
posting 4.8 ppg, 1.6 rpg and 2.2 apg in 79 games with Detroit last season.  

 Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/15/00 
 The Warriors placed Fortson on the injured list today with a sore right 
foot. The league's leading rebounder, Fortson's injury is on the same foot he 
broke last season. Golden State signed free agent point guard Randy 
Livingston to take his roster spot.  

 Dan Majerle , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Majerle said that he will miss ""at least"" two more weeks after re-injuring 
his left hamstring during Monday's practice.  ""Obviously, I came back too 
soon,"" said Majerle, who was hoping to play in Tuesday night's game against 
Charlotte before the injury occurred.    

 John Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Wallace left practice early on Tuesday after being hit in the face by an 
unidentified teammates' open hand.  He suffered a swollen right eye, but 
should be available for Wednesday night's game against the Pacers.  

 Jalen Rose , G IND - Farragut Academy Updated 11/15/00 
 Rose is expected to be in the starting lineup tonight for Indiana's Central 
Division matchup with the Detroit Pistons.  He has missed the Pacers' first 
six games after breaking his wrist during the preseason.  Fantasy owners who 
drafted Rose should be thrilled by his return, and hope he can duplicate his 
solid numbers of a year ago.  

 Rashard Lewis , F SEA - Fear Updated 11/15/00 
 With rookie Desmond Mason out of the mix at shooting guard, Lewis may spend 
some time at the position.  He has played mostly small forward in his career 
but started at shooting guard during his rookie season.  Lewis has shown some 
proficiency shooting from the outside.  He scored 22 points against the 
Knicks Tuesday hitting 4-of-7 three-point attempts.  His versatility may be 
valuable in a league where playing players at multiple positions is 
allowed.    

 Ruben Patterson , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Patterson replaced rookie Desmond Mason as the starting shooting guard 
Tuesday.  Mason who had been relatively unproductive as a starter was benched 
and did not play.  Patterson scored 10 points and grabbed four rebounds.  He 
is not known for his scoring but can pad his stats with rebounds, assists, 
and steals.  Patterson might be worth adding to your Fantasy team if you play 
in a deep league.     

 Brent Barry , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Barry has finally joined the Sonics lineup after missing the first six games 
with a sprained ankle.  He came off the bench and scored 14 points and had 
four rebounds in Tuesday's game against the Knicks.  Barry lost his starting 
shooting guard job in training camp but will continue to come off the bench 
until head coach Paul Westphal decides he wants to shake the lineup up 
again.    

 Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Sabonis was impressive in his season debut for the Blazers Tuesday.  He came 
off the bench and scored 12 points in 13 minutes.  Sabonis had been sidelined 
for the first eight games due to torn cartilage in his left knee.  Look for 
Sabonis to continue to come off the bench for Portland and play less minutes 
this year.  He will still give you you points, rebounds, blocks, and assists 
making him valuable as far as centers are concerned.     

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Mills missed Tuesday's game against Cleveland due to a sore back.  He 
remains questionable for Wednesday's game at Minnesota.  When he does return 
he may be inserted into the starting lineup at small forward.  Starting power 
forward Danny Fortson will miss the next three games due to a sore right 
foot.  Mills and Chris Mullin will be called upon to fill the void in the 
frontcourt.    

 Chris Mullin , F GS - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Mullin was inserted into the starting lineup Tuesday against the Cavaliers 
at small forward alongside Antawn Jamison.  Playing in just his second game 
of the season, Mullin scored 13 points and grabbed six rebounds.  He will 
most likely remain in the starting lineup until starting power forward Danny 
Fortson returns.  But the void in the starting frontcourt may also be filled 
by Chris Mills.  The 37-year old Mullin is still a solid shooter but his lack 
of quickness makes him a liability on defense.  His poor defense could cost 
him minutes of playing time.     

 J.R. Reid , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Reid was activated on Tuesday, filling the roster spot left vacant by Wesley 
Person, who is out with an elbow injury.  Reid has missed Cleveland's first 
six games with tendinitis in both knees.  

 Wesley Person , F CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Person was placed on the injured list on Tuesday with a bruised right 
elbow.  He averaged 7.4 points and 3.6 rebounds over his first five games of 
the season.  His spot on the roster will be filled by J.R. Reid.    

 Tracy McGrady , F ORL - Farragut Academy Updated 11/15/00 
 McGrady suffered a strained right hip flexor during Tuesday night's game in 
Sacramento.  He was injured in the first half, and played only 14 minutes 
after halftime.  ""Right now I'm in a lot of pain,"" said McGrady.  ""I don't 
know if I'll be able to go Thursday.""  

 Cal Bowdler , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/15/00 
 Bowdler was removed from the injured list today, filling the roster spot 
left by Roshown McLeod, who is out with an undiclosed ailment.  Bowdler has 
missed Atlanta's first eight games with a sprained MCL.

Goal Line Isolation




DESCRIPTION

Line up in a Trips Right formation.  Have inside receiver run a five 
yardpost, drawing coverage from the middle zone defender.  The middle 
receiver will run an eight yard curl.  The outside receiver will run a 
delayed slant.  Most of the coverage should be moving left.  The running back 
will delay, then run up the middle to the back of the end zone, then dart to 
the right, the QB will delay and sprint right also. The defense will be 
moving left and should be a step behind.  If the QB can sprint to the end 
zone, a lane may be open, or else the RB should be open. 

QB : The quarterback should initally delay for a split second before 
sprinting to his right. quarterback can make a good head fake to the left or 
look at his receivers on the left before . He should run the ball into the 
end zone if it is open or throw the ball to his running . The quarterback 
should run the ball if the defense is out of , even if the running back is 
open. This will eliminate the chance of a incomplete pass or .

RB : The running back should initially delay for a split second to give a 
block for the quarterback. This will allow the play to develop and keep the 
defense from worrying about the RB. The RB then runs forward to the back of 
the end zone and makes a sharp cut to the right before going out of bounds. 
Make sure the running back stays around the back of the end zone so the 
quarterback can throw the ball over the defenders head if need be.

Other Players : The other players should do their best to draw the defense 
towards the left side of the field.

==================================

Center Hook and Ladder


DESCRIPTION

Line up with twins to the left; one blocker on the left of center; one WR on 
the right and a RB to the left of QB

RB: go in short motion to the left; make a loop patern on outside of the 
""twins"" who should block for him. The RB is secondary receiver.

Right WR: Do a 5-yard button hook to inside.

QB: Throw to right WR.

Right WR: Lateral ball to the center who after the snap should be moving 
parallel to line of scrimmage, about 2-3 yards down field.

Center: Receive lateral and run option with QB who should stay in 
pitch-relationship after he throws the ball.

QB: If the hook isn't open, hit the RB or run for it.

Left Guard: Block 


QB : The quarterback needs to first read the defense. If the right receiver 
can beat the coverage then look the defenders off and deliver a good quick 
pass to the receiver. The receiver should be able to use his body to shield 
the defender. If the defense is in good position to stop the pass call an 
audible or be prepared to throw the ball to your secondary receiver (RB). As 
soon as the quarterback throws the ball he needs to immediately get into 
position to receive the pitch from his center. The quarterback will most 
likely have to be running full speed right after he throws the ball so he can 
be in a good pitch relation with his center. Make sure the quarterback never 
stops running with the center.

Right WR: The right receiver needs to run full speed off the line of 
scrimmage to push his defender back. As soon as he gets about 5-yards down 
the field he should curl in towards the quarterback and use his body to 
shield the defender. Make sure the receiver knows to knock the ball down if 
the quarterback makes a bad pass. As soon as the receiver catches the ball he 
should immediately pitch the ball to his center. Don't be in too big of a 
hurry. If the pitch isn't there the receiver should turn the ball up field 
for as many yards as possible or try to get the pitch to his quarterback. 
Don't pitch the ball to the other team. 

Center: The center will run 2-3 yards forward then drag the line of scrimmage 
left to right. The center should be running at a medium speed until the 
receiver catches the ball. This will allow the receiver to get a good handle 
on the ball before pitching it. The center should be on the inside of the 
receiver and must be prepared to give a quick pitch to the quarterback. If 
there is a defender between the center and the quarterback, the center should 
fake the pitch and continue up field.

Other Players : The other players need to follow the routes on the play 
diagram so they force the defenders to the opposite side of the field. The RB 
should always be ready for the pass. He is the secondary receiver and needs 
to be able to bail the quarterback out of trouble.

Caution : This play requires practice and flawless execution. Timing is 
Crucial.

SUPER $198 RT SALE COAST-TO-COAST BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES
This past week, we watched business travelers get hit with their sixth
fare hike of the year. Some routes of over 1,500 miles have increased by
as much as $370 roundtrip since January 1, 2000. Fight back with our
leisure fares from select U.S. cities that let you fly coast to coast for
as little as $198 roundtrip through March 30, 2001 (travel to Florida
markets is valid through March 14). For example, fly from Seattle to
Orlando or San Diego to Baltimore. You have many options for travel
throughout the nation. Tickets must be purchased by December 1, 2000. Get

THERE=01,S STILL TIME TO FLY ON TURKEY DAY FROM $59 RT
The trick to getting a great fare for those last minute home for the
holiday flights is to travel on Thursday and return on Friday. These
specials are valid for travel throughout both days, but availability is
best for travel later in the day on Thanksgiving, and return travel early
in the day on Friday. You can enjoy a late meal with your family, pack up
some leftovers and be home in time to rest up over the weekend. These
deals start at $59 (New York City to Boston, for example). You can travel
coast to coast from $151. Fares are based on one-way mileage: 250 miles
for $64 to $79 roundtrip; 251-500 miles for $79 to $99 roundtrip; 501-750
miles for $103 to $129 roundtrip; 751-1,000 miles for $119 to $149

473,"Hi Folks,

I know many of you have full enough mailboxes as it is but with this being a
crazy week for many with the Thursday games AND the Holiday, I'm getting a
lot of rapid fire stuff that I'm just sending as I get it.  It's always a
mad dash on weeks like this.


Here's the latest on Stephen Davis:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/sports/leaguesandsports/nfl/20002001/wa
shingtonredskins/A49398-2000Nov21.html   By Mark Maske in the Washington
Post.  From the article:  A second set of X-rays taken yesterday showed a
hairline crack in the right forearm of Washington Redskins tailback Stephen
Davis. Davis said last night that he is hopeful he will be able to play
Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedEx Field.
According to Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer, yesterday's X-ray showed a crack
in Davis's forearm, but the bone was not broken or displaced. Tyer said the
Redskins will put a splint on the arm but will, for the most part, treat the
injury like a bruise. Davis should be able to play when he reaches a point
at which there is not too much discomfort, Tyer said.
""It hurts now,"" Davis said. ""It's something I have to overcome. They told me
it's day to day. We'll see. If the game were today, no, I couldn't play.
[But] I'm hopeful.""
Davis left Monday's game and underwent an X-ray that showed no breaks. But
Tyer said the X-ray taken Monday was of low quality, so Davis underwent
another yesterday. Davis returned to Monday's game, in which he rushed for
85 yards on 19 carries.
""It didn't affect me at all,"" he said. ""We ran the ball a couple times after
it happened and did okay.""
Skip Hicks filled in for Davis on Monday and likely would start against the
Eagles if Davis is unable to play. Veteran tailback Adrian Murrell was on
the inactive list Monday but could be worked into the mix if Davis is
sidelined or limited.
The Redskins can ill afford to add Davis to a list of sidelined offensive
starters that includes wide receiver Michael Westbrook, guard Tre Johnson,
center Cory Raymer and quarterback Brad Johnson. Davis is the NFL's
third-leading rusher with 1,073 yards. He is tied for the league lead with
10 rushing touchdowns, and his 261 carries place him third.
Turner acknowledged the injury could affect Davis's ability to hold on to
the ball. ""That's a concern when a running back has an arm injury,"" Turner
said. ""Hopefully they can pad it and he'll be able to handle it.""

My View:  All this is well and good but what you want to know is how he's
going to do.  It's much easier to not stick my neck out but here goes
anyway:  From all the info I'm getting (including this story) I think you'll
see Davis play against Philadelphia this week.  If you made put a number on
it, I'd say 80% he plays like normal.  It's an enticing matchup as the
Eagles have been weak against the run lately averaging 148 yards rushing
allowed per game over their last 4 games.   No one talks about it but the
""tough guy"" factor is likely very much at work here.  Darrell Green played
Monday because the team really needed him.  It's now being disclosed he
played with a torn calf muscle and all the talk is about ""leaders stepping
up"" and such.  Stephen Davis' injury appears to be primarily an issue of
managing the pain and I'd be very surprised to see him sit after Green's
performance.
Thanks to my friend J.D. Gardner for his help on this one.

Subject: Bush's Testimony


 The founder of the (web?)site said he called
Gore and  Bush  andasked them to send in their
testimonies for the web site-since they BOTH
""claim"" to be Christians.
 Gore's office said that he didn't have one in
typed  form - but Bush did.
Here it is...please pass this along!
 Very Important!!! This could change America.
 (Whether Democrat or Republican)
 If any of you are interested in what George Bush
says about his faith, here it is.
 (Alex Mooney, State Senator)
 From George W. Bush:
 ""Actually, the seeds of my decision had been
planted  the year before, by the Reverend Billy Graham.
He visited my family for a summer weekend in Maine.
I saw him preach at the small summer church,
St. Ann's by the Sea.  We all had lunch on the patio
overlooking theocean. One evening my dad asked Billy
to answer questions from a big group of family
gathered for the weekend. He sat by the fire and
talked.
  And what he said sparked a change in my heart. I
don't remember the exact words. It was more the power of
his example. The Lord was so clearly reflected in his
gentle and loving demeanor. The next day we walked
and talked at Walker's Point, and I knew I was in the
presence of a great man.  He was like a magnet; I  felt
drawn to seeksomething different. He didn't lecture
or admonish; he shared warmth and concern. Billy Graham
didn't make you feel guilty;  he made you feel  loved.
Over the course of that weekend, Reverend Graham
planted a mustard seed in  mysoul, a seed that grew
over the next year. He  led me to the path, and I  began
walking.
  It was the beginning of a change in my life. I had
always been a ""religious"" person, had regularly
attended church, even taught Sunday School.
But that weekend my faith took on a new meaning. It
was the beginning of a new walk where I would commit
my heart to Jesus Christ.
 I was humbled to learn that God sent His Son to
die for a sinner like me. I was comforted to know that
through the Son, I could find God's amazing grace,
a grace that crosses every border, every barrier and
is open to everyone.
 Through the love of Christ's life, I could understand
the life changing powers of faith.
  When I returned to Midland, I began reading the
Bible regularly.  Don Evans  talked me into joining him
and another friend, Don Jones, at a men's community
Bible study. The group had first assembled the year before,
in Spring of 1984, at the beginning of the downturn in the
energy industry.   Midland was hurting. A lot of people
were looking for comfort and strength and direction.
A couple of men started  the Bible study as a support group,
and it grew. By the time I began attending, in the fall of
1985, almost 120 men would gather. We met in small
discussion groups of ten or twelve, then joined the
larger group for full meetings.
  Don Jones picked me up every week for the meetings.
I remember looking forward to them. My interest in
reading the Bible grew stronger and stronger,
and the words became clearer and more meaningful.
We studied Acts, the story of the Apostles building the
Christian Church, and next year, the Gospel of Luke. The
preparation for each meeting took several hours,
reading the Scripture passages and thinking through
responses to discussion questions. I took it seriously,
with my usual touch of humor....Laura and I were active
members of the First Methodist Church of Midland,
and we participated in many family programs,including
James Dobson's Focus on the Family series on raising children.
As I studied and learned, Scripture took on greater meaning,
and gained confidence and understanding in my faith.
I read the Bible regularly.  Don Evans gave me the
""one-year"" Bible, a Bible divided into 365 daily readings,
each one including a section from the New Testament, the Old
Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs. I read through that Bible \
every other year. During the years in between, I pick
different chapters to study at different times.
I have also learned the power of prayer. I pray for
guidance. I do not pray for earthly things, but for
heavenly things,for wisdom and patience and understanding.
My faith gives me focus and perspective.It teaches humility.
But I also recognize that faith can be misinterpreted in
the political process. Faith is an important part
of my life. I believe it is important to live my faith,
not flaunt it.
 America is a great country because of our religious
freedoms. It is important for any leader to respect
the faith of others. That point was driven home when
Laura and I visited Israel in 1998. We had traveled to
Rome to spend Thanksgiving with our daughter, who was
attending a school program there, and spent three days in
Israel on the way home. It was an incredible experience.
I remember waking up at the Jerusalem Hilton and opening
the curtains and seeing the Old City before us,
the Jerusalem stone glowing gold. We visited the \
Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
And we went to the Sea of Galilee and stood atop the
hill where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount.
It was an overwhelming feeling to stand in the spot
where the most famous speech in the history of the world
was delivered, the spot where Jesus outlined the
character and conduct of a believer and gave
his disciples and the world the beatitudes, the
golden rule, and the Lord's Prayer.
 Our delegation included four gentile governors,
one Methodist, two Catholics, and a Mormon, and several
Jewish-American friends. Someone suggested we read
Scripture. I chose to read ""Amazing Grace,"" my favorite
hymn. Later that night we all gathered at a
restaurant in Tel Aviv for dinner before we boarded
our middle-of-night flight back to America. We talked
about the wonderful experiences and thanked the guides
and government officials who had introduced us to
their country.
 And toward the end of the meal, one of our friends
rose to share a story, to tell us how he, a gentile, and
his friend, a Jew, had (unbeknownst to the rest of us)
walked down to the Sea of Galilee,joined hands underwater,
and prayed together, on bended knee.
 Then out of his mouth came a hymn he had known as
a child, a hymn he hadn't thought about in years.
He got every word right:
         Now is the time approaching,
         by prophets long foretold,
         when all shall dwell together,
         One Shepherd and one fold.
         Now Jew and gentile, meeting,
         from many a distant shore,
         around an altar kneeling,
         one common Lord.

 Faith changes lives. I know, because faith has
changed mine."" Icould not be governor if I did not
believe in a divine plan that supersedes all human
plans. Politics is a fickle business. Polls change.
Today's friend is tomorrow's adversary. People lavish
praise and attention. Many times it is genuine;
sometimes it is not. Yet I build my life on a
foundation that will not shift. My faith frees me.
Frees me to put the problem of the moment in proper
perspective. Frees me to make decisions that others
might not like. Frees me to try to do the right
thing, even though it may not poll well...
The death penalty is a difficult issue for supporters
as well as its opponents.
 I have a reverence for life; my faith teaches that
life is a gift from our Creator. In a perfect world, life
is given by God and only taken by God. I hope someday
our society will respect life, the full spectrum of life,
from the unborn to the elderly. I hope someday unborn
children will be protected by law and welcomed in life.
I support the death penalty because I believe,
if administered swiftly and justly, capital punishment is a
deterrent against future violence and will save
other innocent lives. Some advocates of life will
challenge why I oppose abortion yet support the
death penalty.  To me, it's the difference between
innocence andguilt.
 Today, two weeks after Jeb's inauguration, in my
church in downtown Austin, Pastor Mark Craig,
was telling me that my re-election was the first
Governor to win back-to-back, four-year terms in
the history of theState of Texas.
 It was a beginning, not an end.... People are starved
for faithfulness. He talked of the need for honesty in
government. He warned that leaders who cheat on their
wives will cheat their country, will cheat
their colleagues, will cheat themselves.
 Pastor Craig said that America is starved for
honest leaders. He told the story of Moses,
asked by God to lead his people to a land of
milk and honey.  Moses had a lot of reasons to
shirk the task. As the Pastor told it, Moses'
basic reaction was, ""Sorry, God, I'm busy. I've got a
family. I've got sheep to tend. I've got a life.
""Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring
the sons of Israel out of Egypt? The people won't
believe me, he protested.  I'm not a very good
speaker. Oh, my Lord, send, I pray, some other person,
""Moses pleaded. But God did not, and Moses ultimately
did His bidding, leading his people through forty
years of wilderness and wandering, relying on God for
strength and direction and inspiration.
  ""People are starved for leadership, ""Pastor Craig
said, ""starved for leaders who have ethical and moral
courage."" ""It is not enough to have an ethical
compass to know right from wrong,""  he argued.
""America needs leaders who have the moral courage
to do what is right for the right reason.
It's not always easy or convenient for leaders to step
forward,"" he acknowledged. ""Remember, even Moses
had doubts."" ""He was talking to you,"" my mother
later said. The pastor was, of course,talking
to all of us, challenging each one of us to make
the most of our lives, to assume the mantle of
leadership and responsibility wherever we find it.
He was calling on us to use whatever power we have,
in business, in politics, in our communities, and
in our families, to do good for the right reason.
And his sermon spoke directly to my heart and my
life.... There was no magic moment of decision.
  After talking with my family during the Christmas
holidays, then hearing this rousing sermon,
to make most of every moment, during my inaugural
church service, I gradually felt more comfortable
with the prospect of a presidential campaign.
 My family would love me, my faith would sustain
me, no matter what. ""During the more than half century of
my life, we have seen an unprecedented decay in
our American culture, a decay that has eroded the
foundations of our collective values and moral
standards of conduct.
 Our sense of personal responsibility has declined
dramatically, just as the role and responsibility
of the federal government have increased.
The changing culture blurred the sharp contrast
between right and wrong and created a new standard
of conduct: 'If it feels good,do it.'
and 'If you've got a problem, blame somebody else'.
""Individuals are not responsible for their actions,""
the new culture has said. ""We are all victims of
forces beyond our control."" We have gone from a culture of
sacrifice and saving to a culture obsessed with
grabbing all the gusto. We went from accepting
responsibility to assigning blame.
As government did more and more, individuals
were required to do less and less. >The new culture said:
if people were poor, the government should feed them.
If someone had no house, the government should provide one.
If criminals are not responsible for their acts,
then the answers are not prisons, but social programs....
""For our culture to change, it must change one heart, one soul,
and one conscience at a time. Government can spend
money, but it cannot put hope in our hearts or a
sense of purpose in our lives.""... ""But government should
welcome the active involvement of people who are following a
religious imperative to love their neighbors through after
school programs, child care, drug treatment,
maternity group homes, and a range of other services.
Supporting these men and women - the soldiers in
the armies of compassion - is the next bold step of
welfare reform, because I know that changing hearts
will change our entire society.""
  ""During the opening months of my presidential
campaign, I have traveled our country and my heart has been
warmed. My experiences have reinvigorated my faith in the
greatness of Americans. They have reminded me that
societies are renewed from the bottom up, not the top down.
 Everywhere I go, I see people of love and faith,
taking time to help a neighbor in need... These people and
thousands like them are the heart and soul and greatness of
America. And I want to do my part. I am running for
President because I believe America must seize this moment,
America must lead. We must give our prosperity a
greater purpose, a purpose of peace and freedom and hope. We are a
great nation of good and loving people.
And together, we have a charge to keep.""","Bush Gore George Bush

	Reforms in India Are Tantalizing,
But Debates Cool Investor Ardor
	By DANNY PEARL 
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
	NEW DELHI, India -- The tumblers of economic reform have slowly but surely 
been turning in India over the past decade, each click resonating through 
this nation of a billion people. Lately the prospect of unlocking its markets 
has seemed a bit brighter -- but not bright enough to impress foreign 
investors.
	Every day, India's financial pages are filled with news of a new opening: a 
plan to sell the government's stake in a big car company, the lifting of 
controls on the textile industry. But the fine print tells another story: 
stubborn hurdles to foreign investment, insistence on public control and open 
battles among ministers that could force Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 
to protect his diverse coalition government rather than take fresh economic 
gambles.
	""The debate over reforms will be endless unless there is a crisis, and there 
is no crisis around the corner,"" says Mahesh Vyas, executive director of the 
Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, a private organization. India is 
still coasting along with economic growth above 6% a year.
	
	Still, there are some worrisome signs. Last month, Standard & Poor's lowered 
its outlook on the Indian rupee because of the darker prospects for economic 
reform. Foreign investment, already a pittance compared with the rest of 
Asia, has slackened recently, and a few big companies, including Enron Corp. 
of Houston and British Telecommunications PLC, are freezing some India 
investments as their focus shifts to more-developed markets. Just 14% of the 
multinational-company executives recently surveyed by AT Kearney said they 
were more likely to invest in India than in China; 56% said the reverse.
	Even critics think Mr. Vajpayee's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which 
one year ago won a mandate to lead its second coalition government, is 
sincere about pushing for further opening of India's statist economy. But 
what government officials call the second generation of reforms -- India's 
Congress Party launched the first in the early 1990s to allow more private 
enterprise -- is meeting stiff domestic resistance. Workers and traditional 
Indian businesses are as scared of competition as ever, and the Congress 
Party, now in the opposition, is playing on those fears. So the government is 
moving in small, often contradictory steps.
	""Their hearts are in the right place,"" says John Band, executive director of 
ASK Raymond James, an affiliate of the American investment bank.
	Here is how the reforms are shaping up in five critical areas.
	Privatization
	India's program of selling off government companies is still mostly talk, but 
much of it could come to fruition in the next few months. While the 
government probably won't meet its target of raising 100 billion rupees 
($2.14 billion) this fiscal year, it is likely India will shed some perennial 
money losers. The first could be Air India and its domestic counterpart, 
Indian Airlines, both of which have attracted expressions of interest from 
foreign airlines including Air France and Singapore Airlines. Divestment 
Minister Arun Shourie, who isn't revealing the full list, said on the first 
day of the World Economic Forum's ""India Economic Summit"" in New Delhi Sunday 
that before proceeding to formal bids, India will reject suitors who could 
pose national-security concerns. India, he said, wants to avoid buyers who 
might shut down the beleaguered airlines and keep the lucrative landing 
rights.
	Job padding is legendary in India, so fear of job losses is real. Bank 
workers fired a warning shot across privatization's bow this month with a 
one-day, midweek strike against government banks. The next day, the 
government announced it was moving forward anyhow, seeking a law that would 
allow it to reduce its stake in public banks below 50%. The move wasn't as 
bold as it seemed, though: The law wouldn't actually contemplate a sale of 
shares and wouldn't allow any single investor to buy more than 1%. Government 
officials pledged to keep the ""public character"" of the banks.
	Supporters of divestment within Mr. Vajpayee's cabinet are few but 
influential. They are concentrating their efforts on a plan to sell the 
government's 50% stake in car maker Maruti Udyog Ltd., a joint venture of 
Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. and India's government. But the cabinet is divided 
over the sale, and Mr. Vajpayee has to keep all the members of his coalition 
happy, including hardline nationalists. This weekend, Mr. Shourie flew to 
Bombay to placate leaders of the radical Shiv Sena party who were upset about 
the prime minister's recent olive branch to separatists in the embattled 
region of Kashmir. One of their demands, he says, was that ""Foreigners should 
not come to acquire control of the Indian economy.""
	Budget pressure may force India to follow through with privatization. The 
World Bank has cited concern that India's budget deficit is a whopping 9.6% 
of its gross domestic product, though much of the red ink can be traced to 
state budgets. Mr. Vyas of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy 
believes the real benefits of privatization will come only when the states 
start to sell off their bus companies and electric utilities -- but ""that's 
not even being talked about.""
	Media
	India has an unrestrained local press but remains suspicious of foreign 
media, especially when they show naked flesh or give their own spin on the 
Kashmir dispute. Technology has brought paradoxes: Indians now get scores of 
channels by cable TV, but only government-controlled TV over regular antenna. 
Foreign magazines and newspapers enter the country freely by the Internet but 
cannot print in India. (The Wall Street Journal is among the papers that have 
made informal efforts to lift the barrier.)
	
	The newly appointed information minister, Sushma Swaraj, a BJP hard-liner, 
this month seemed to be resolving the issues in favor of openness. At her 
prodding, the government suddenly allowed programmers to serve homes directly 
by satellite -- but with some tight restrictions on foreign ownership. 
Equally worrisome was Ms. Swaraj's explanation for the government's decision 
to move forward. Before, she explained, the government had no satellite 
facility in India; now it did, and could cut off broadcasts that offend 
India's programming code. Ms. Swaraj is looking for ways to regulate Web 
sites, too. ""They are bound by this code,"" she said. ""As yet there is no 
complaint. If there is, we can take care of it.""
	Ms. Swaraj started a ""national debate"" over whether to lift the restrictions 
on foreign media; 10 days later ended it with a firm 'no.' But as one door 
closes in India, another often cracks open. Private FM radio is expected to 
make its debut in the spring. The government has also taken steps to help 
film studios get expansion financing, just as Hollywood starts to prowl the 
Hindi film industry for investments.
	Telecommunications
	The Vajpayee government has earned broad kudos for its liberalization of 
telecommunications, and the results may even help build domestic support for 
other reforms. Sales of new telephones have exploded recently as service 
improves. In Bombay, which once had five-year waiting lists for new telephone 
lines, the government's local-phone company, MTNL, now promises, even if it 
doesn't always deliver, hookups in two days. The reason is new competition 
from a private group that includes a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp.
	Telecom investment is vital for India because so much of the country's 
booming software and call-center business relies on fast communications with 
the U.S. The government only recently loosened its control over international 
data gateways, a move that Indians hope will alleviate heavy daytime data 
traffic jams. Idika Solutions, a software company based in Hyderabad, got in 
the habit of downloading files at 6 a.m. to avoid the rush.
	Further reforms should speed up improvements. Next year, Parliament is 
expected to pass a ""convergence"" law, allowing telephone, wireless and data 
services to come under the same license. And the following year government 
phone company VSNL is scheduled to lose its monopoly on long-distance phone 
service.
	Trade
	In theory, India, a member of the World Trade Organization, has no choice but 
to open its borders to foreign products, and so far it is sticking to 
schedule, passing a new patents law and so forth. But rather than investing 
to get ready for free competition, many business families are simply getting 
out of manufacturing. Their worry isn't so much luxury goods from the West, 
which will still face steep duties even after quotas are lifted in the 
spring, but goods like batteries from China and palm oil from Malaysia. The 
government is starting to heed the call for more protection: Last week, it 
raised duties on cooking oil and listed 131 imported products that would have 
to list prices in rupees and register with the Indian bureaucracy.
	The government is also trying to prepare traditional businesses such as 
textiles for a world without quotas. Still, the industry is so thoroughly 
regulated that it is hard to see India's mild reforms having much effect. For 
example, the government just decided to allow big domestic producers to move 
into certain products that were reserved for small companies, but it still 
requires yarn-spinners to produce 10% of their yarn in a form that can be 
used by obsolete hand looms. With certain fabrics, ""if I produce it on a 
power loom, I'm breaking the law,"" says Ramesh Chander Kesar, president of 
the Textile Association India in New Delhi. ""Why should there should be a 
restriction?""
	The main reason is that textiles employs an estimated one of every six Indian 
workers, and the government is loath to throw them out on the street. 
Actually, even when mills close, as many have in central Bombay, mill owners 
often have to keep paying the workers and are restricted in their reuse of 
the land.
	""If we can fire a worker for not working, that will send a powerful signal. 
But there are no votes in it,"" says Gurchuran Das, former Procter & Gamble 
chief in India and occasional adviser to the Congress Party. ""Nobody has the 
courage to explain to the people the way Clinton had the courage to explain 
NAFTA: that jobs will be lost but, in the end, jobs will be created.""
	Some less courageous moves are possible: one idea under discussion in New 
Delhi is to give labor flexibility to companies that are exporting heavily.
	Finance
	India made some big financial reforms in the early '90s, with liberalization 
of interest rates, loosening of currency restrictions and encouragement of 
private banking. The country just needs some more money to prime the system.
	The government is approving new financial products, such as derivatives. The 
big prize, investment bankers say, would be opening of the 
government-controlled mutual fund and pension plans. Right now, they offer 
fixed returns. Private investment companies want the government to let them 
offer Indians more-aggressive private pensions.
	""They are listening,"" says Raju Panjwani, managing director of Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter India. ""Maybe equities are considered risky, but we can't even 
invest in corporate bonds."" The government has a plan under study, called 
""Project Oasis,"" that would allow private pension fund management, with some 
restrictions.
	Another possible source of long-term capital is insurance, something there 
isn't much of in India. The government took a big step last year in allowing 
private insurance companies back into India after nearly 50 years. But as the 
race to start marketing policies begins, only half a dozen companies have 
jumped in. Foreign companies are limited to 26% of each insurance 
partnership. That is a problem, because launching an insurance company can 
take $75 million, and ""there are not that many Indian companies that can 
support 74% of that kind of a number,"" says Gary Benanav, chief executive of 
New York Life Insurance Co.'s international unit. The company, which is 
launching its India insurance venture in partnership with an Indian 
conglomerate, estimates the Indian market could support 50 insurance 
competitors.
	""They've made a decision which I don't think in the long run is in the best 
interests of India, though I understand it. The colonial era has left a few 
wounds here,"" Mr. Benanav says.

Snow in Hawaii!

Snow on Mauna Kea - January 23, 2002

Photos by Steven Parente

Throughout last weekend, the Big Island was deluged with heavy rains, high
surf and cool temperatures... reaching the low 60's in Hilo. Brrrrrrr. 

This late winter storm also brought heavy snowfall for Mauna Kea. Mauna Kea
translates into white mountain, and as you view the shots you'll understand
why.  From the ocean floor this is the tallest mountain in the world. 
There was a break today, so I braved the cool Hilo morning temperatures
(low 60's), went to Lili'uokalani Gardens, and took some shots of the
beautiful view of Mauna Kea. Hope you enjoy! - Steve 

Take a look!
http://www.hawaiitropicals.com/picsofhawaii.html

We have some great new selections of potted orchids to look at as well. 
Like the Chieftain"" Wild Warrior Orchid plant Winner of the American Orchid
Society's Award of Merit, this impressive plant with a mild fragrance
similar to the stephanotis flower is NOW AVAILABLE!

The ""Chieftain"" Wild Warrior Orchid plant is a Brassia/Oncidium mix
(P.O.I.-85 Brscdm). Each plant arrives in a 4"" pot and wicker basket. Its
3-inch blooms have a white center and yellow-green petals that are long &
narrow with brown spots.

Dear icruise member,
Although we have had some snow in New York, everyone's mood at I-Cruise is sunny. January blues? Not with these amazin' deals!
If you can't find a room on Burbon Street for Mardi Gras then here's your chance to sail on the Rhaspsody of the Seas on 2/9/02.. You'll get two full days of fun in New Orleans over Mardi Gras for only $629 including port-limited space so book right now.
To me, there's nothing better then planning your summer vacation now and having some time to look forward to it. Celebrity's beautiful Constellation has a great itinerary in August for 13 fantastic days in Europe.. For only $1699 including port, it's a real deal on a brand new ship.
And, the Carnival Spirit has an incredible price for a 7 day Southbound Alaska trip.. $833 including port is outrageous.
I knew these rates would chase your blues away!

A bum, who obviously has seen more than his share of hard
times, approaches a well dressed gentleman on the street.
""Hey, Buddy, can you spare two dollars?""

The well-dressed gentleman responds, ""You are not going to
spend in on liquor are you?""

""No, sir, I don't drink,"" retorts the bum.

""You are not going to throw it away in some crap game, are
 you?"" asks the gentleman.

""No way, I don't gamble,"" answers the bum.

""You wouldn't waste the money at a golf course for greens
fees, would you?"" asks the man.

""Never,"" says the bum, ""I don't play golf.""

The man asks the bum if he would like to come home with him
for a home cooked meal.

The bum accepts eagerly. While they are heading for the
man's house, the bum's curiosity gets the better of him.
""Isn't your wife going to be angry when she sees a guy like me at your table?""

""Probably,"" says the man, ""but it will be worth it. I want  her to see what happens to a guy who doesn't drink, gamble  or play golf.""",,two dollars,

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.","Applewhite

He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=188491&""><B>Larry Foster</B></A>, WR DET - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1186&""><B>Bert Emanuel</B></A>, WR DET - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1203&""><B>Muhsin Muhammad</B></A>, WR CAR - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season.

CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1871&""><B>Todd Bouman</B></A>, QB MIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury.

Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1041&""><B>Drew Bledsoe</B></A>, QB NE - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1171&""><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury.

He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1612&""><B>Oronde Gadsden</B></A>, WR MIA - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>

Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1152&""><B>Jerome Bettis</B></A>, RB PIT - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today.

534,"With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

 Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 The Warriors put Mills on the injured list on Tuesday with an inflamed rig=

ankle. The veteran has averaged 12.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in 15 games th=

keep him on the bench unless you can find an adequate replacement on the=20
waiver wire.   =20

 Adonal Foyle , C GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Foyle was activated on Tuesday night in time for Golden State's game again=
st=20
Portland. He had been on the injured list after having surgery to repair to=
rn=20
ligaments in his right ring finger. Foyle averaged 2.9 points and 4.4=20
rebounds in 16 games as a starter for the Warriors. Foyle has no Fantasy=20
value at this point. =20

 Chris Crawford , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Crawford was placed on the injured list Tuesday with a sprained left ankle=
=20
and a sore right big toe. He is averaging 4.5 points in 19 games, and has n=
o=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Rod Strickland , G WAS - Fear Updated 12/12/00=20
 Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of=
=20
his hamstrings. He is expected to play on Wednesday when the Wizards host=
=20
Allen Iverson and the Sixers. Strickland is averaging 14.5 points and 7.2=
=20
assists per game for Fantasy owners this season, numbers which could be a=
=20
great deal better if he wasn't stuck in Washington.  =20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/12/00=20
 Wallace, who missed Saturday night's game against Detroit because of a=20
injured right wrist, practiced on Monday with his wrist taped. He is close =
to=20
100 percent and is expected to play against Golden State on Tuesday night.=
=20
Fantasy owners who rolled the dice and played Wallace this week will be hap=
py=20
that they did - Golden State's frontcourt has been decimated by injuries an=
d=20
will be easy prey for Wallace.  =20

 Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He =
is=20
scheduled to have X-rays taken on the ankle on Tuesday, and won't be eligib=
le=20
to return to action until Dec. 19. He is averaging 8.1 points and 8.2=20
rebounds per game this season, and has marginal value in the world of=20
Fantasy.  =20

 James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's=
=20
game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel.=
=20
""The team got together and discussed some things,"" said Posey, ""and=20
(protesting) is what the conclusion was (Monday)."" Reports out of Denver sa=
y=20
that the probems between the coach and his players escolated when Issel=20
ripped Nuggets' center Raef LaFrentz after a recent loss to the Boston=20
Celtics. If the protest does in fact take place, Fantasy owners will miss a=
=20
night of production from some of their Denver players.  =20

 Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The=
=20
Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right kne=
e,=20
and team officials are saying that he came off the injured list too soon. T=
he=20
Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for=
=20
their game against Dallas on Tuesday night. With Andre Miller at the point,=
=20
neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value.  =20

 Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left=20
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.=
=20
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how=20
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. ""The=20
shoulder's still attached to my body,"" said Henderson. ""No question I'll=20
play.""  Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one o=
f=20
Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about=
=20
Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he i=
s=20
still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a=
=20
smart move. =20

 Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Haw=
ks=20
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where h=
e=20
has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of=20
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more=20
natural small forward position. Before his injury, Jackson was Atlanta's=20
leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth=
 a=20
roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid=
=20
replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.   =20

 Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00=20
 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,=
=20
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had=
=20
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, bu=
t=20
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluation=
s=20
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and=20
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.    =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00=20
 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will underg=
o=20
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expecte=
d=20
to miss 6-8 weeks.  Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wi=
se=20
to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viab=
le=20
alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.  =
=20

 Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is=
=20
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 reboun=
ds=20
per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value. =20

 Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00=20
 Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter afte=
r=20
aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coac=
h=20
Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday.=
=20
Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once=
=20
again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00=20
 In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a=
=20
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds=
=20
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the=20
field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury =
-=20
which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their=
=20
lineup.   =20

 Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him =
to=20
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  =
He=20
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of h=
is=20
$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy=
=20
league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go =
by=20
total points.    =20

 Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for=20
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if=20
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of=
=20
his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if=
=20
possible.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. =
=20
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by De=
c.=20
20 ""at the latest"".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up=
. =20
Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy=
=20
when he returns before you pick him up.   =20

 Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When h=
e=20
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the=
=20
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a=
=20
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you=
=20
to let him go.   =20

 Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00=20
 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised=
=20
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't=
=20
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want t=
o=20
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.   =
=20

 Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a=20
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to=
=20
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one =
of=20
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game t=
o=20
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy=
=20
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns=
=20
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.   =20

 Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00=20
 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game=20
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading=20
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has=
=20
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00=20
 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the=
=20
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of=20
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two=20
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per=20
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill shou=
ld=20
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.    =20

 Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis i=
n=20
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until=20
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major=20
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5=
=20
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another=
=20
viable option is open to you.   =20

 Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the=20
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't=
=20
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The=20
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scori=
ng=20
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to tho=
se=20
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit=
=20
Atkins if your roster allows it.   =20

 Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surger=
y=20
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured=
=20
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game=20
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland=20
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Mill=
er=20
and Brevin Knight.   =20

 Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00=20
 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games wi=
th=20
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in=20
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights=
=20
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes=
=20
occur. =20

 Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00=20
 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions=
=20
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on t=
he=20
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reported=
ly=20
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have=
=20
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will=
=20
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was=20
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who ha=
s=20
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive=
=20
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.  =20

 Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00=20
 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over =
a=20
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a ""leave"" by the te=
am=20
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds =
in=20
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.  =20

 Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00=20
 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his=20
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,=20
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is=20
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.  =20

It's crunch time so  let's jump right into our  Upgraded and Downgraded=20

players are moving.?  Keeping an eye on these trends as they can very often=

make all the  difference.

Joe

?

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=
=20
down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my  list of guys I see moving this=
=20
week.

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Aaron Brooks  (NO)? We keep hyping the kid and he keeps delivering.? =20
Another outstanding game Sunday where he rolled up 441 yards and 2 TDs as h=
e =20
went 30 for 48.? The Saints rushing game is clearly struggling so it  appea=
rs=20
Brooks will continue to air the ball out.? Yes, he'll make some  young QB=
=20
mistakes and I'd be surprised if he didn't throw as many interceptions  as =
he=20
does TDs.? I expect him to throw a lot of both.? I almost  started him over=
=20
Peyton Manning in my local league but didn't pull the  trigger.? Manning wa=
s=20
solid but Brooks was better.

QB Kordell Stewart  (Pit)? Kordell made our upgrade list last week and here=
=20
he sits  again.? It took a few years, but he's showing folks that maybe 199=
7=20
was no  fluke.? He showed guts coming back in the game after being knocked=
=20
out with  a bad knee or calf (depending on whether you listen to coach Bill=
=20
Cowher or  Stewart)? The TD rush was highlight material.? His problem all=
=20
along  seems to have been confidence and he's surely brimming with it now.?=
=20
Kent  Graham was so bad I won't even mention him in the downgrades but he p=
ut=20
on a  horrid display when he was in the game.? He's  awful.

QB Jay Fiedler  (Mia)? Dan Fouts said on Monday Night Football a few weeks=
=20
ago  that a nice pass just thrown by Fiedler ""was as pretty as anything Dan=
=20
Marino  ever threw"".? Fiedler has those moments and he was having them fair=
ly=20
often  against the supposedly tough Bills where they were supposedly going =
to=20
have an  advantage in their cold weather.? Didn't play out that way.?=20
Fiedler  looks pretty darn good.

QB Jeff Garcia  (SF)? We had him high in week 14 like we have all year and=
=20
he  didn't disappoint.? WR Terrell Owens was a huge help and apparently=20
Jerry  Rice's wife?harping on the radio had some sort of positive effect.? =
=20
The Chargers had been very tough against the pass and Garcia shredded  them=
.

QB Brett Favre  (GB)? I have a hard time putting a finger on it but this gu=
y=20
just  does what it takes to get the job done.? He'd be much better off if W=
R =20
Antonio Freeman earned 10% of his paycheck but in the meantime, Bill=20
Schroeder's  doing a great job.?=20

QB Jeff George  (Was)? Lil Danny Snyder removed the primary obstacle to=20
keeping  his QB Jeff George off the field by firing Norv Turner Monday.?=20
George  looks to start this week and possibly for the rest of the year.?=20
Although  tying Snyder to anything past the next series is a stretch.? I'm =
a=20
Jeff  George fan though and he does give the team a big arm.? We'll see how=
=20
it  goes but at least it looks as if he'll get his shot.

?

RBs Moving  Up

RB Mike Anderson  (Den)? Like you need me to tell you this.? The fact that=
=20
he  ran buck wild on a tough New Orleans defense made the effort all the=20
more  impressive.? He bruised a knee but seemed to bounce back and looks to=
=20
be  good for Sunday.? Clearly, the Denver OL is the star on this team so if=
=20
you  own Anderson, it's probably not a bad idea to grab KaRon Coleman for t=
he=20
stretch  run.?=20

RB Fred Taylor  (Jac)? For all the early?ripping I've done to Taylor, he's =
=20
performed just as we predicted he would lately - like a madman.? You don't =
=20
need me to tell you he's been awesome.

RB Warrick Dunn  (TB)? Can the little guy take up the slack for Mike=20
Alstott??  I've got a couple hundred reasons that says ""yes"".? Ok, rushing=
=20
for 200+  against Dallas is nothing special (it's happened in 23% of the=20
Cowboys games  this year) but you have to admit Dunn looked great  Sunday.?

RB Corey Dillon  (Cin)? One can only salivate about what he might do if he=
=20
played  for a team like Denver.? The fact he can continue to roll up huge=
=20
yardage  on this team is amazing.? New QB Scott Mitchell is a huge boost as=
=20
he looks  like Peyton Manning back there compared to Akili  Smith...

RB Ahman Green  (GB)? Green's a guy that's finally living up to his =20
potential.? You always knew he had the physical skills but now he seems to =
=20
be catching up mentally as well.? He showed a nice nose for the endzone =20
Sunday with the 2 TDs.

RB Lamar Smith  (Mia)? So much for the cold weather hamstring worries.?=20
Smith  carried the load Sunday in frigid Buffalo and looked great.? It look=
s=20
to me  like he's picking up right where he left off.

RB Terrell Fletcher  (SD)? It's not exactly the same as earning the startin=
g=20
RB job in  Tennessee or Indianapolis, but Fletcher does seem to have nailed=
=20
down the #1 RB  slot in San Diego.? And that's worth something.? You have t=
o=20
decide  how much...

RB Fred Beasley  (SF)? We loved Beasley early in the season as he racked up=
 =20
TDs.? He got back in the mix Sunday with 5 carries and a TD.? The FB  for S=
an=20
Francisco has always been a valuable FF slot and Beasley might be worth  th=
e=20
roll of the dice if you're thin at RB.

RB Shawn Bryson  (Buf)? Finally, Bryson does something besides make me look=
=20
bad for  hyping him.? He rolled up 88 yards on just 12 attempts Sunday and=
=20
looks to  take advantage of Sammy Morris' ankle troubles.?=20

RB Terry Allen  (NO)? Allen made an appearance Sunday and with Jerald Moore=
=20
and  Chad Morton failing to astound anyone, Allen could get more looks.?=20
Whether  he's got anything left in the tank remains to be seen.

?

WRs Moving  Up

WR David Boston  (Ari)?? Boston turned in a huge game Sunday and has to be =
=20
considered an upgrade.? He's a streaky guy but with Frank Sanders a total =
=20
non factor, Boston is getting most of QB Jake Plummer's attention these =20
days.? And with Arizona almost certain to be playing from behind, he could =
=20
do some damage.

WR Darrell Jackson  (Sea)? Jackson was red hot several weeks ago but had=20
cooled of  late.? He warmed up again Sunday with Jon Kitna under center.?=
=20
It's  tough to depend on the Seahawk passing game but Jackson could be wort=

WR Curtis Conway  (SD)? Conway has benefited the most from the Ryan Leaf =

WR Bobby Shaw  (Pit)? Shaw may still be available in your league as the=20

WR Shockmain Davis  (NE)? Ok, I'll be honest.? I'm pretty much just includi=

him  here because he's the owner of the coolest name in the  league...

TEs Moving  Up

TE Dwayne Carswell  (Den)? Carswell's finally starting to emerge as the TE =

choice  in Denver.? His 62 yards Sunday were second only to San Diego's=20
Freddie  Jones.? You have to worry about Desmond Clark stealing time but I'=

TE Reggie Kelly  (Atl)? One of the few bright spots for Atlanta has been th=

play  of Kelly.? He caught 4 passes for 44 yards Sunday with a TD.? New QB =

Doug Johnson may lean on him as he settles in.

TE Mark Bruener  (Pit)? Bruener makes the list not only for having another=

TE Andrew Glover  (NO)? Obviously, the play of Aaron Brooks raises the leve=

Sunday  including a good looking TD catch.

Players Moving  Down

QBs Moving  Down

QB Shane Matthews  (Chi)? Take a seat Shane.? Cade McNown likely makes his =
=20
return.? Folks can hardly wait...

QB Troy Aikman  (Dal)? Emmitt Smith owners had to love it but did it seem=
=20
strange  to anyone else that the Cowboys felt the best way to come back fro=
m=20
a huge  deficit against Tampa was to feed the ball to Emmitt?? Clearly, the=
=20
team  has zero faith in Aikman's ability to throw the ball.

QB Shaun King  (TB)? I know he's had trouble with the back but 65 passing =
=20
yards?? That's a joke.? He'll be better but I've seen  enough.

QB Brad Johnson  (Was)? It's the Jeff George show.? At least until?George =

QB Rob Johnson  (Buf)? In leagues that penalize for interceptions, you'd ha=

Johnson.?  Once again, he starts the game but finishes holding a  clipboard=
.

?

RBs?Moving  Down

RB Jamal Anderson  (Atl)? Anderson's not playing too badly but the team is=
=20
in  shambles.? After QB Chris Chandler was benched, Anderson vented some =
=20
frustrations saying for all he knew, ""he might be punting this week"".? I =
=20
don't think we'll see that but I also don't think we'll see the days of him=
 =20
seriously rushing the ball for the rest of the year.

RB Shaun Alexander  (Sea)?? RB Ricky Watters has proven to be less than an=

ideal  playmate refusing to share the ball.? Actually, he's played so well=

that  Mike Holmgren has been reluctant to do anything to disrupt the flow o=

Philadelphia  RBs? Forget about them.? This team will live and die by =20
Donovan McNabb.

RB Jermaine Fazande  (SD)? Evidently, Fazande is the 2nd choice behind=20
Terrell Fletcher  now.? That's gotta hurt...

?

WRs Moving  Down

WR Joe Jurevicius  (NYG)? This has nothing to do with the play of Jureviciu=
s=20
as he's  been very solid but you have to think Ike Hilliard will be a facto=
r=20
when he  returns.? He's no lock to go this week but he may be  close.

WR Terrance Mathis  (Atl)? Mathis continues to struggle on a team that's in=

a  tailspin.? New QB Doug Johnson seemed to like throwing to Shawn Jefferso=
n =20
which could spell more bad things for Mathis.

WRs Torrance Small /  Charles Johnson (Phi)? Forget about it.? Donovan McNa=

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 With the injury to Joe Jurevicius, Dixon will take over as the Giants' third 
down receiver. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Fear Updated 12/12/00 
 An MRI performed on Monday revealed a sprained medial collateral ligament in 
Jurevicius' left knee. Head Coach Jim Fassel says that Jurevicus is expected 
to be sidelined for at least three to four weeks.  Ron Dixon will take over 
as the Giants' third down receiver. At this point, neither player has any 
real Fantasy value.     

 Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Cowboys' defensive line played its best games of the season, sacking 
Redskins' quarterback Jeff George five times while limiting Stephen Davis to 
only 57 yards rushing. Dallas' unit, which has been ravaged by injuries, held 
the 'Skins to only 13 points on the afternoon and looked much more like a 
cohesive unit than in recent weeks. Expect the Cowboys to follow up this 
effort with another solid performance against the Giants, but look long and 
hard before giving Dallas' D the start this week.   

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 With the announcement that Jeff George will remain Washington's starter for 
the last two games, Johnson's season and Fantasy value is all but gone. Don't 
be surprised to see Johnson in a new uniform come training camp.    

 Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00 
 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale.  Coach 
Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning 
to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23.  Fantasy owners should look 
elsehwere for a Fantasy QB.  Griese hasn't played in almost a month.  A 
player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team.      

 Jackie Harris , TE DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that 
have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to 
be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible.  

 Irving Fryar , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar 
has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards 
and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four 
games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to 
Fantasy owners in deeper leagues.   

 Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them 
going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also 
dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up 
against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much 
as a result.  

 James Thrash , WR WAS - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 
 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the 
Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, 
so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league 
uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three 
man.   

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more 
than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games 
prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by 
being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take 
this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over 
the final two games.  

 Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win 
over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season.   

 Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run 
a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy 
value at this point in the season.   

 Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He 
missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year 
career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't 
start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 
 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the 
Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being 
bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in 
your Fantasy season.   

 Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He 
rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was 
walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to 
play next Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 
 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in 
two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback 
situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea.   

 R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several 
team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made 
several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a 
October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder 
of the season.  

 Larry Centers , RB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/11/00 
 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 
yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' 
Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk.   

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, 
allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the 
Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by 
this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of 
injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati 
next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs.  

 Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 
carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks 
to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point.   

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00 
 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing 
for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a 
touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm 
is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to 
try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as 
Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.   

 Kurt Warner , QB STL - Risk Managers Updated 12/11/00 
 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 
346 yards.  Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from 
the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week.  If you are one 
of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to 
Fantasy glory.   

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 
 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this 
week's game against Dallas.  The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 
passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the 
starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday 
against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins 
this week.    

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 
 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns.  He 
gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards.  With his 
performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back.   
 

 Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Murder Inc. Updated 12/11/00 
 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against 
Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also 
bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers 
are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team 
when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday.  

 Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 
 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams.  He 
will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter 
will be up for the task.  He struggled in their first meeting but still 
managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown.    

 Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game 
against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went 
down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving 
Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in 
the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' 
quarterbacks all together.   

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game 
against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven 
carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the 
game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of 
the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy 
value to help you at this important stage of the season.   

 Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/11/00 
 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday.  Look for 
Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week.  He had six catches 
for 130 yards in their first meeting this season.    

 Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 
 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three 
opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, 
could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham 
(groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. 
Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should 
hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a 
better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' 
D this week.

Wednesday of the upcoming holiday week. This will help those who want to
travel home for the holidays and visit the relatives (or get away from
Uncle Ed=01,s snoring during the football game). You can take advantage of =
a
two-day getaway that takes you where you want to go on Thanksgiving
Thursday and brings you back home Friday for a restful weekend. Airfares
are as low as $64 roundtrip, and just $151 roundtrip for travel up to
1,500 miles from your departing airport. Our Wednesday e-mail will also
offer newly negotiated deals to 15 Caribbean cities, including Cancun,

STATEMENT FROM SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER III

The American people voted on November 7.  Governor George W.
Bush won 31 states with a total of 271 electoral votes.  The
vote in Florida was very close, but when it was counted,
Governor Bush was the winner.

Now, three days later, the vote in Florida has been recounted.
Over two-thirds of the state election supervisors overseeing
the recount are Democrats.

At the end of this recount, Governor Bush is still the winner,
subject only to counting the overseas ballots, which have
traditionally favored the Republican candidate.  No evidence of
vote fraud either in the original vote or in the recount has
been presented.

Now the Gore campaign is calling for yet another recount in
selective and predominantly Democratic counties where there
were unexplained large vote swings in their favor in the
recount.

It appears that the Gore campaign is attempting to unduly
prolong the country's national Presidential election through
endless challenges to the results of the vote here in Florida.

Furthermore, the more often ballots are recounted, especially
by hand, the more likely it is that human errors, like lost
ballots, and other risks, will be introduced.  This frustrates
the very reason why we have moved from hand counting to
machine counting.

Let me say a word specifically about the Palm Beach ballot.
There is a rule of law to be followed for elections.  The state
of Florida has established legal procedures to design, approve,
publish and, if need be, to protest ballots before the election.
The ballot was designed by a Democratic elections supervisor.
She approved it.  The Democratic Party did not question it
before the election.  This ""butterfly""-type ballot was used in
recent elections in the same county under the same rules.  Again,
the Democrats did not complain.  The overwhelming majority of
voters who used the ballot understood it and cast valid votes.
Our lawyers have confirmed the legality of this ballot, and we
have copies of the relevant Florida statute available for you
to see.

The Gore campaign has also tried to make a lot of the fact that
double marked ballots are not counted.  A key principle in
America is one person, one vote.  If we have ballots with two
votes, of course we cannot count them or guess about them.
Ballots that are double-marked can't be evidence of the voter's
intent to vote one way or another.  No jurisdiction in the
United States would accept such a ballot as a valid vote, and
Florida law specifically does not.  It happens in every
precinct in every election.  And the procedure is clear:  These
ballots must be disregarded.

We understand, and I understand personally, that it is
frustrating to lose by a narrow margin.  But it happens.  It
happened to the Republican Presidential candidates in 1960 and
1976.  Both Vice President Nixon and President Ford put the
country's interest first.  They accepted the vote for the good
of the country.

It is important that there be some finality to the election
process.  What if we insisted on recounts in other states that
are very close?  For example, in Wisconsin, Iowa, (and if we
don't win) New Mexico.

Let the country step back a moment, pause, and think about
what's at stake.  This may be the last chance.  There is no
reasonable end to this process if it slips away.

The purpose of our national election is to establish a
""Constitutional government,"" not unending legal wrangling.  We
will therefore vigorously oppose the Gore campaign's efforts to
keep recounting until it likes the result.  For the good of the
country and the sake of our standing in the world, the
campaigning should end, and the business of an orderly
transition should begin.

STATEMENT FROM BUSH COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR KAREN HUGHES:

""The vote count on Tuesday night showed Governor Bush won
Florida's election, and a recount has now confirmed his victory.
The only votes left to be counted are the overseas absentee
ballots, which in the past have favored Republican candidates.
Bob Dole carried the overseas ballots in Florida in 1996 by a
margin of 54 to 40 percent, even though he lost the election in
Florida.  We hope Vice President Gore and his campaign will
reconsider their threats of lawsuits or still more recounts,
which could undermine the constitutional process of selecting a
President and has no foreseeable end.""

DEMOCRATS URGE GORE TO QUIT LEGAL WRANGLING

""Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, questioned the
Gore campaign's wisdom in challenging the Palm Beach result.
The right thing, Mr. Breaux said, 'is to count the votes and
respect the decision,' without lengthy litigation. And Senator
Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, warned against
getting mired in the courts...

""'I want Al Gore to win the election,' Mr. Torricelli told
reporters, 'but more than that, I want somebody to win this
election. There is going to have to be a very compelling case
for anybody to take this into a court of law.'""
- The New York Times' R. W. Apple, Jr., 11/10/00

NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST, OTHERS: REVOTE OR COURT REMEDY
POLITICALLY UNSOUND AND LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE

""The problem is that potential remedies, such as a new election
in Palm Beach County, seem politically unsound and legally
questionable. The sad reality is that ballot disputes and
imperfections are a feature of every election. It will poison
the political atmosphere if presidential elections, in
particular, come to be seen as merely a starting point for
litigation.""
- New York Times, Editorial, 11/10/00
http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/10/opinion/10FRI1.html


""We say yes to counting a little more, but the legal action
about which Mr. Daley spoke elliptically should be approached
with enormous caution and restraint. Absent more than is
currently known, our sense is that either a lawsuit or a repeat
vote would raise at least as many questions as it would likely
resolve; the courts in the end can't legitimize the results.""
- Washington Post, Editorial, 11/10/00
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57302-2000Nov9.html


""Some folks are even calling for a rerun of the Florida
election.  It is important to decide this election by the rules
that 100 million Americans understood -- or should have
understood -- when they entered the voting booth Tuesday.  This
is not just about fair play for Al Gore and George W. Bush. It
is about defending a system that regards voting-day verdicts as
the final word, a concept that distinguishes this nation from
most others in the world.""
- San Francisco Chronicle, Editorial, 11/9/00


""'You know, I don't think the ballot was a problem, Bill and
I'll tell you why-is that there's one section I don't know if
people are really looking at, which relates to electronic or
electromechanical voting.  And in that particular case, what
the law says down here, it says 'Voting squares may be placed
in front of or in back of the names of candidates and
statements.'""
- CNN's ""Crossfire,"" Greta Van Susteren,  11/09/00


""If you start saying the ballot should be thrown out because
of confusion, I think that cases like that could be brought all
over the country.""
- CNN's Larry King Live, Bill Schneider, 11/8/00

  inherited.

  Our Republican team would provide that kind of leadership.
  George W. Bush and all of our great Republican candidates
  will focus on results, not daily polls.

  The other side has been running non-stop negative attacks
  against our candidates.  Don't let their fear tactics
  succeed.  Please take your family and friends to the
  polls today and vote for George W. Bush and all of our
  great Republican team.

  Thank you very much.

Faulk To Undergo Knee Surgery
http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1105/860356.html  From the article:  St.
Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk will undergo surgery Monday to remove
loose cartilage from his right knee, an injury that forced him out of Sunday
night's loss to the Carolina Panthers.

Faulk practiced Friday and went out for (pregame) warmups after having the
knee drained earlier Sunday, but the knee began to lock on him. Coach Mike
Martz said team doctors told him Faulk would miss only 2-3 weeks. But
teammate D'Marco Farr, a defensive tackle, was out a month with a similar
operation.

""He could feel the cartilage getting hung up in there,"" Martz said. ""Really,
there was nothing else to do.""

Justin Watson started in place of Faulk, who leads the NFL with 1,326 yards
from scrimmage. Faulk suited up for the first half, but was wearing sweats
after the break.
Watson scored on a 3-yard run in the third quarter, but finished with 12
yards on 12 carries.

Faulk has been playing with a sore knee most of the season. An MRI on Monday
also revealed torn scar tissue and an enlarged bruise in addition to the
loose cartilage.

My View:   Coach Mike Martz called him ""Superman"" last week as he battled
through injuries.  Apparently, he's mortal after all.  The surgery to remove
the loose particles is relatively uninvasive and he should be back in 2-3
weeks.  If you started Faulk, don't be kicking yourself.  There was nothing
you or anyone else could have done.  As of late Sunday afternoon / evening,
he was still the starter.  You can't control last minute scratches when a
player has a problem during pregame warm-ups.  All Faulk owners knew he
wasn't 100% but we all know he's still one of the best RBs in the game even
when dinged up.  Hindsight is 20 / 20. Let it go.

All you can do is move forward.  Let's look at it analytically:

The problem now becomes a matter of timing.  If Faulk comes back according
to schedule, he'll be ready in week 13 or 14.   Most FF leagues play a 14
game regular season with playoffs in weeks 15 and 16 (or 17 if your league
hasn't wised up yet)  This means Faulk will likely miss your regular season
but be available for your Fantasy League Playoffs.

For Teams that own Faulk:  As we predicted, Justin Watson carried the load
for Faulk but he was hardly impressive with 12 yards on 12 carries, although
he did get the TD.  I'd think he'll improve but it's obvious Faulk, not just
the system, is the driving force behind his success.  What I'm saying is
that plugging Watson in is not a situation like Trent Green or Jeff George
stepping in.  Watson struggled and one has to worry about Trung Canidate (if
he ever sheds the candybone label) or Robert Holcombe.  A better option
might be taking a look at some less glamorous RBs that are playing very well
right now like Chicago's James Allen, Buffalo's Sammy Morris or J.R. Redmond
in New England.  If you've got a playoff spot secured, don't panic.  Grab a
lesser RB via trade or free agency and hang on for the playoffs, keeping
your fingers crossed for a quick and full recovery.  If you need a big push
just to make the playoffs, I'd think very hard about dealing Faulk and
shoring up your short term needs.  You have to remember, you've got to MAKE
the playoffs in order to win your Fantasy Bowl.

For Teams who don't own Faulk:  The question you must ask yourself is do you
have depth somewhere that you'd be willing to trade away for Faulk?  If you
seem a lock for the Fantasy Playoffs, it might be a great move.  In other
words, you trade some depth away for an injured Faulk that you know will be
a bench player for you over the next few weeks. In turn, you get Faulk back
just in time for your playoff push.  But you're banking on #1 Making the
playoffs and #2 Faulk being ready by week 14.  Only you can judge your
chances for #1 but from all I'm hearing, #2 seems pretty darn likely.  If
you've got the playoffs spot sewn up, it could be a great move to trade for
Faulk now.  Don't give up too much.  Don't hesitate to let the Faulk owner
know that teammate D'Marco Farr was out of action for a month with a similar
injury and we all know a RB's knee takes much more stress with the cutting
that does a Defensive Tackle's.  Throw in some comments about St. Louis
resting Faulk for the playoffs.

Speaking of the ""resting for the playoff"" factor - You have to look at how
well the Saints are playing.  The Super Bowl  champs are in real danger of
not even winning their own division.  It looks like St. Louis will be
battling to the end of the regular season so while still a possibility, the
Rams resting all their players doesn't seem as likely as it did a month ago.
Another reason you shouldn't give up too much in trading for Faulk.  Make
sure to ""sell"" your position either way based on whether you're a Faulk
owner or not.  If you're trading him away, you want to talk up the Saints
and the tough scenarios if St. Louis loses again (the hot Giants are next on
the road).  St. Louis will be fighting for their lives you'll say.  If
you're dealing for Faulk, obviously, you'll take the other side of the fence
and talk about how Martz is smart and will likely rest Faulk for the
postseason.

The truth, in my opinion, lies closer to the side of Faulk will be pressed
back into service for the regular season.  Assuming the surgery / rehab goes
well of course.  Faulk's one of the tougher guys in the league, so I have no
reason to believe he won't make a normal recovery.

Bottom line is look at this situation going forward.  You can't do anything
about what's happened.  Make it work to your advantage over the next few
weeks.  Good luck!

I'll see you tonight with the Upgrade and Downgrade Player Report.

Joe

QB  Rob Johnson (Buf) is listed as questionable, but he is not expected to 
play. QB  Doug Flutie will start in his absence.
?
*** Saturday Update? Buffalo  QBs.? This could get ugly.? Johnson said he 
felt that  anonymous negative comments made in the Sports Illustrated article 
were made by  Flutie.? It's still my contention that Flutie is playing for?a  
starting job from here on out.? If he plays well Sunday and the Bills win,  
Johnson had better be for finding a baseball cap he's comfortable with.?  

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is out with a bad shoulder. Jim Miller  starts?in his 
absence.
?
QB Troy Aikman (Dal) will sit with his sore back.  Randall Cunningham will 
take over the reins this week.

QB Brian Griese  (Den) was arrested for driving under the influence. This is 
not expected to  cause any problems for the remainder of this season.

QB Mark Brunell  (Jac) is on a bye and will not play.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) will start with  his sore ribs.

QB Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) has played two games with his  sore neck. Look for 
the same this week.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD) practiced with  the second team. He will likely back up Jim 
Harbaugh for the remainder of the  season.

QB Brock Huard (Sea) is not expected to play this week. Jon Kitna  returns to 
the starting job.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) is out with a broken  pinkie. Trent Green starts in his 
absence.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) will  miss at least this week's game. He could be out 
from 2-4 weeks. Jeff George gets  the start in his absence.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Brad Johnson (Was)  is looking like his knee injury 
could be more serious than originally  thought. He has a?""significant"" (grade 
2) tear of his MCL in his left knee  that is close to being a complete tear 
which is a grade 3.? This will get  very interesting if Jeff George plays  
well.

- mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool

that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's 
tax cuts going to the ""wealthiest one percent"".   That is the biggest load of 
garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the 
math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to 
the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, 
obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was wonderful 
except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.  

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for 
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride 
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the 
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because 
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for 
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of 
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no 
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which 
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was 
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline 
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us 
to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that 
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible 
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this 
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on 
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.  
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my 
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.  
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed 
our connection we were forced to spend a combined 
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, 
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead 
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten 
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of 
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again 
because of this experience.

Apparently, Enron closed a deal in the US earlier this year with WeBco which is a joint venture between Balli Group and Wierton Steel.

730,"If the bottom line is being able to start critical construction activities as 
quickly as possible, rather than properly characterizing the type of permit 
revision, we have developed an argument, based on the Clean Air Act (which is 
the source for Arizona's air program), that would allow construction to 
commence shortly after notice, without the need for a permit. Of course, TWP 
has already submitted a permit revision application and would be willing to 
see this process through to completion as long as TWP could begin 
construction promptly and plan on beginning operation of the new equipment 
when the permit is finallly issued, presumably in the spring.

The argument goes as follows: under CAA sec 502(b)(10), 42 USC 7661a(b)(10),  
a state program needs to allowchanges within a permitted facility if the 
changes are not ""modifications"" and do not exceed the emissions allowable 
under the permit. A ""modification"" is defined as ""any physical change in, or 
change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the 
amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the 
emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted.""

 Someone should confirm the technical status of the equipment changes and 
whether they meet the criteria. This may be something to point out to Nancy 
how she can exercise her discretion to get us where we need to go. Nancy can 
give this approval after Shudeish completes his calculations confirming TWP's 
netting calculations.

736,"Rick/Scott:

Thanks for the info.

I wanted to give you an update on the CoGen project.  I have met with
several groups in ENA Development, and the potential for a fuel switching
facility is attracting a lot of attention.  They initially considered the
20 MW portable unit, but now think there may be more value with a 40 to 50
MW unit.  The opportunity to generate more power using the fuel advantage
caught their eye.  The current scheme is to site the facility at the Tupman
plant, provide EOTT steam and power at a reduced cost, ENA market the
electricity, and EOT participate in the revenue of power sale.  This has
the advantage of controlled energy cost for the plant, participation in the
revenue stream, and limited capital outlay for EOTT.  The downside would be
lack of control of the merchant power activity, and it would be a permanent
facility.  I am also assuming permitting and emissions compliance issues
would not be extraordinary.

There will be a longer construction time, but I stressed to ENA that a new
boiler would need to be built first in anticipation of the generator, and
then it could be incorporated when available.

There were some more questions regarding the plant's energy profile.  I
gave them the information showing historic, and anticipated energy needs,
both for power and gas.  They do need to understand what the daily heat
requirements would be; i.e.  hours of operation at the plant, 8 hr
operations Vs 24 hr operation, temperature requirements for your processes,
are there peak requirements, are there any pressure requirements for steam
or just heat, does the plant shut down operations routinely, etc.  I passed
along you names (Rick & Scott only) as plant contacts as questions come up.

Thanks for your help, and I'll let you know how things progress.

737,"I just spent about 40 minutes on the phone with my counterpart discussing the 
upcoming meeting.   The call was cordial.  A couple of items that came up 
worth passing on are as follows:

 There is some expectation in PG&E to decon the compressors.  They may not 
wish to do so right now but maybe soon.  There is also discussion of these 
being out of service for up to a couple of months.  I passed along the idea 
that it is probably best to simply monitor the situation and the PCB matters 
may well take care of themselves through routine maintenance activities and 
continued operation.  No official decon processes exist as far as were are 
aware.  There are no restrictions on their continued use exist at that 
location.  PG&E may be considering employee exposure or continued source of 
contamination as issues why they want to decon. We should expect to this to 
come up during the meeting.  I do not think that this type of decon would 
necessarily be in line with the standard for reimbursement under our 
operating agreement - which is ""reasonable action, measured in accordance 
with commonly accepted standards of care and practice in the natural gas 
pipeline industry in California.""  I'm not aware of SoCal engaging in any 
such action even though their system was highly impacted by PCBs.   I did not 
bring this standard up but we should be aware of it and recommend monitoring 
before any decisions are made.  My counterpart did acknowledge that even when 
the Long Term facilities eliminated the delivery problem, that we may well 
have continued issues with respect to the PCBs in the station and the 15 
miles of pipe downstream for some lengthy period of time.  PG&E did not 
appear to be contemplating any pigging or decon of this section of the system.

 PG&E may be looking for some more comfort on the question of ""source 
control"".  We have said that this situation is relatively unique to the 
Topock Lateral but we have had some minor hits elsewhere recently.  We should 
be in a position to explain why the remainder of the system is not a problem 
and even if it should be why the Long term facilities should be able to 
handle any concerns.

738,"Kenny, as you may know, there were 9 environmental applications submitted
to various local, state, and regional agencies requesting approval to
initiate this project and most of the requests apply to crossing the bypass
channel.   As of today, we have received one approval, and that from the
State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that
we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls
into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were
submitted but have had no reply.  I would caution that we might get into
trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval
from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project
even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a
project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an
applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials
until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in
California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all
agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that
we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or
strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when
we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you
know.......

Because of the merger, the record was overlayed in Global Counterparty and all history for Northern States Power Company is now under Xcel Energy.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EBS Joins EWS
Effective, July 12, EBS has become a business unit within Enron Wholesale S=
ervices.  All EBS commercial support functions will be integrated into thos=
e units within EWS, which enables us to better manage the resources and cos=
ts of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions have been consolidated into the following unit=
s:
Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele

Additionally, the North American EBS origination teams have been consolidat=
ed into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  North American trading and ri=
sk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also over=
see the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the =
Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo=
st effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be=
 closed by October 1.


Global Strategic Sourcing
Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implem=
ented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel an=
d entertainment, and professional services.  Global Strategic Sourcing (""GS=
S"") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to en=
list your support in the implementation of these new procedures.

This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.  Next week's message w=
ill focus on professional services.

Travel and Entertainment - Enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on tr=
avel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adju=
stments.

?=09Air Travel - Air transportation is the single largest component in the =
travel mix.  In recognition of this fact, a number of significant discounts=
 have been negotiated with all of the major carriers.  There are two separa=
te channels available to employees to access the Enron-negotiated fares.  T=
he first is Travel Agency in the Park (""TAP""), or the GSS-approved preferre=
d travel agency for your location, and the second is the new Enron-managed =
online travel booking service, ClickTrip, located at <http://clicktrip.enro=
n.com/enron>.

Over the coming weeks, GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTri=
p, as the primary method of booking domestic U.S. travel for a number of re=
asons.  First, excluding proprietary carriers like Southwest Airlines, Clic=
kTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for =
their destination, including the Enron-negotiated fares.  Second, industry =
data shows that employees will generally make the most cost-effective trave=
l decision when presented with the relevant facts.  Conservatively speaking=
, we estimate that a 20% savings in airfare is attainable through the use o=
f this tool alone.  Third, it is relatively painless to use.  Fourth, Click=
Trip is accessible 24X7 from any internet-enabled personal computer and aft=
er-hours telephone support is available. If you have travel-related questio=
ns, please contact Tracy Ramsey at ext. 6-8311.
=20
One final air travel reminder worth promoting: For employees who fly in the=
 United States, use of non-refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 perce=
nt less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying=
 a $100 fee.

?=09Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a n=
umber of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business=
 unit's individual hotel policy. Additionally, preferred car rental rates i=
ncluding insurance coverage with National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.=
) have been negotiated for your use.  More detailed information is availabl=
e regarding both programs through our travel site located at <http://travel=
.enron.com>.

Enron Industrial Markets - Forest Products
EIM began trading in the physical markets for Forest Products (newsprint, p=
ulp, recycled paper, and lumber) in August, 2000 and Steel in January, 2001=
.  Since then EIM has handled over 140,000 tons of recycled paper, 180,000 =
tons of newsprint, 150,000 tons of pulp, 160 million board feet of lumber, =
and 210,000 tons of steel.  Currently on a weekly basis, EIM is moving appr=
oximately 20,000 tons of forest products (newsprint, pulp and recycled pape=
r), 3 million board feet of lumber, and 10,000 tons of steel products throu=
ghout the world. =20

Due to much larger volumes of forward trading, EIM is expanding its physica=
l product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 mil=
lion tons per year.  The EIM Logistics Group coordinates the activities of =
customer service, supply and demand matching, scheduling of owned assets, a=
nd physical transport and warehousing.  These activities are primarily coor=
dinated through the Houston office, with additional resources in London and=
 Singapore.

Additionally, EIM owns paper mills in Quebec City and New Jersey which have=
 a combined production capacity of 750,000 tons of newsprint per month, and=
 a cold rolling steel mill in Arkansas with capacity of 400,000 tons per ye=
ar.  Each of these facilities includes Logistics resources that are coordin=
ated through the EIM Logistics Group.

Enron Global Markets - LNG
Enron Global LNG has enhanced its Atlantic Basin LNG supply portfolio with =
volumes from Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG).  Enron Global LNG recently signed =
a Memorandum of Understanding with NLNG for delivery of 1 BCM/ year (billio=
n cubic meters) or (97,000 Mcf/day) from the NLNG Plus Project.  This is a =
two train expansion of NLNG's existing Bonny Island LNG production facility=
.  The expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005.  This deal represents=
 a major step in the establishment of Enron's global LNG network.

EGM - Finance & Structuring
On June 29, 2001, Enron Global Markets - LNG Group successfully completed t=
he divestiture of its 100% equity interest in Progasco, to CHDR, Inc. via a=
n all cash transaction.  Progasco sells and distributes LPG to commercial a=
nd industrial clients, and independent resellers, through a fleet of tanker=
 trucks, bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout Puerto Rico.  CHDR=
, Inc. is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstand=
ing shares of stock of Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. (""Tropigas"").  Upon co=
mpletion of this transaction, Tropigas, hitherto the 3rd largest market pla=
yer will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35% market sha=
re, becoming the 2nd largest Puerto Rican LPG marketer.=20

The sale proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, have been split between P=
rotane (a wholly owned Enron Corp. Delaware subsidiary) and San Juan Gas (S=
JG), and were used to pay down inter-company debt owed to SJG and Pro Carib=
e.  The net (pre-tax) gain recorded on the transaction was $3.9 million.=20

The profitable sale of this strategic asset allows EGM to exit the retail p=
ropane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies: Pr=
otane, Petrolane and Imperial Gas, and will enable Enron to better deploy t=
he cash received and more efficiently manage its Puerto Rican human resourc=
es.=20

EGM - Weather
The Weather group just completed a deal with People's Energy to protect the=
m against lower gas prices during a warmer than normal winter.  This innova=
tive winter protection was structured to manage People's exposure to both t=
he volume and price of natural gas.  Greg Penman and Bob Beyer, from the Ch=
icago office, were the lead dealmakers for this transaction.  Simlar deals =
with other counterparties are expected to come over the winter season.
Also, the Weather Group has started exploring new opportunities with EES.  =
To support this effort, Elsa Piekieniak has joined the group.  Elsa is look=
ing for several people to help her with this initiative.  If you're interes=
ted in a position, please contact Elsa.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

UPDATE ON ENRON EUROPE'S CONTRIBUTION TO 2ND QUARTER RESULTS
Congratulations to all staff for your contribution to another fantastic qua=
rter! =20

By now we hope you will have had an opportunity to read about Enron's Q2 ea=
rnings, which were released to the investment community in Houston on Thurs=
day, 12th July.  Overall the business has seen continued strong growth with=
 revenues increasing to over $100 million in the first half of the year up =
from $30 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share this qu=
arter also exceeded analyst expectations and came in at $0.45 for the quart=
er up from $0.34 for the same period last year.

Equally important, however, is the vital role Enron Europe played this quar=
ter in contributing to the company's overall results.   We are seeing some =
terrific trends here in Europe - notably, on the wholesale side, the Contin=
ental, UK and Nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to streng=
th as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this q=
uarter.  Total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in =
Europe have seen an increase of 172% in the first six months of the year co=
mpared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions=
 per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year.  Specifically, UK power volum=
es are up 204% to 147 TWh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 TWh in th=
e same period last year.  Continental gas volumes have grown from 351 Bbtue=
/day in 2000 to 1,390 Bbtue/day in 2001 - a 296% increase - and Continental=
 power volumes have seen growth of 360% with volumes rising from 18 TWh in =
the first six months of 2000 to 83 TWh for the same period this year.  The =
growth in volumes is not simply limited to the UK and Continental markets, =
however, as Nordic power volumes have increased by 153% from 29 TWh to 73 T=
Wh in the first half of 2001.

The success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading, however,=
 and abound throughout the business:

Enron Energy Services
The retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the clos=
ing of EES' first, major ""marquis"" brand energy outsourcing transaction wit=
h supermarket giant, J. Sainsbury plc.  Of equal importance, Enron Direct's=
 business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160,000. =
 The success of Enron Direct's business model has translated into the devel=
opment of new business on the Continent in the Netherlands and Spain and, m=
ore recently in North America, with the 2nd quarter opening of Enron Direct=
 Canada. =20

Enron Credit
A year after Enron Credit's launch, the total life to date notional value o=
f transactions has surpassed $11.8 billion and in the 2nd quarter alone, En=
ron Credit generated $10.4 million in EBIT.  Further, more than 20,000 read=
ers per week view the Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) through independent public=
ations.  =20

Enron Australia
With 2nd quarter power volumes up 177% from the first three months this yea=
r, Enron Australia is gearing up for a strong growth year.  With the develo=
pment of a physical power position key to expanding Enron's power trading i=
n Australia, work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial purs=
uit of asset development projects.  Other businesses undergoing significant=
 expansion this quarter were coal, renewable energy credits and weather der=
ivatives.=20

Spain:  Arcos
The Arcos asset development project in Spain continues to make great progre=
ss with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being succ=
essfully negotiated this quarter, plus the project achieved another milesto=
ne in the permit/government approvals arena with the granting of its water =
concession in Q2.

UK:  ETOL
ETOL, a long-standing contributor to Enron Europe's earnings, generated yet=
 another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series o=
f deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies at Wilton International. T=
he transaction further strengthens Enron's relationship with Du Pont, one o=
f ETOL's largest customers, and will extend the current steam and power sup=
ply contract through 2010. =20

Enron Metals
A year after entering the metals business, Enron Metals has seen increased =
volumes of 130% in its merchant and financial trading operations this quart=
er with volumes up to over 3.5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1.5 =
million tonnes in the 2nd quarter last year.  Not only has the team seen po=
sitive growth in volumes this quarter, but they have increased their share =
of trading on the LME by 50% and are making significant progress with Proje=
ct Salem - a major IT and systems improvement project that will streamline =
deal capture and risk management for metals transactions.  Finally, the met=
als team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten=
-year origination transaction that, through the addition of smelting assets=
, will enable the metals team to improve its trading position.  The transac=
tion proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of Enron's tradin=
g and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups a=
cross Enron.  =20

Looking to the future, we have every expectation that the strong growth we'=
ve witnessed in Europe for the first half of the year will continue through=
 end 2001.  So, in the words of Solomon Smith Barney analyst, Ray Niles, wh=
en talking about Enron's European wholesale operations results this quarter=
, ""Europe is kicking butt and it's about a quarter of [Enron's] activity, n=
early double what it was last year.  And, that is a new market that is the =
size of the US."" =20

Dear Enron Employees:

I'm sorry to report that a third Enron employee has died in the hospital as a result of injuries from yesterday's explosion and fire at Teesside Power Station.  To lose another employee is a devastating blow to all of us.  A fourth employee remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.  Please keep these employees and their families in your thoughts and prayers.  We will release their names as soon as all family members and relatives have been notified.

I'm in the U.K. now and will be visiting with the employees and families who've been affected by this tragic accident.  I will also visit the site and will meet with authorities in order to determine the cause of the explosion.  I will keep you posted on any new developments.",,,Enron
764,"
Earlier this evening, the police were able to confirm to Enron that all of our employees who tragically died or were injured as a result of yesterday's explosion have now been identified.  This means we are now in a position to give you some information about the members of staff:

Andrew Sherwood

Darren Higgins
Darren was also an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in October 1997.  He was unmarried and lived in Normanby near Middlesbrough.  Darren died at the scene yesterday.  He was 28 and leaves a young son living in Poland.


We are continuing to offer as much support as possible to the families of these employees, as well as their friends and colleagues at the plant and associated sites across Enron.

We understand that the last twenty-four hours have been extremely traumatic for everyone concerned. We appreciate there are many questions that remain unanswered, but for the moment our thoughts and prayers are with those we have lost and their families and friends.

We will communicate more information about the incident as it becomes available.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Congratulations to Ann and Rodney Malcolm, vice president in EIM.  They are the proud parents of an 8 lb. 4 oz. baby boy named Scott.  He was born on Saturday, August 11, 2001.

Congratulations! Bennett and Sarah Brown, Enron Wholesale Accounting Manager, became the proud parents of a baby boy on Sunday, August 12, 2001.  His name is Baker Bennett Brown and he weighed 8 lbs.12 oz.

EIM Trivia
Enron Industrial Markets currently owns two paper mills - Garden State Paper in Garfield, NJ and Papiers Stadacona in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.  The combined annual newsprint capacity is 620,000 tonnes, which roughly translates to 137 billion square feet.  If you assume that the average width of a newspaper page is 25 inches, then this translates into Enron producing enough newsprint in a year to get us to Jupiter and half-way back to Earth.  Papiers Stadacona also produces approximately 100,000 tonnes per year of directory paper.  This translates into roughly 50 million telephone and trade directory books.  That's a lot of phone numbers!

792,"Hello everyone, 

	Not as many upsets this past weekend in the college and pro games. Among the games that were commonly missed were, in the college games, Auburn/Georgia and Iowa/Northwestern; in the pros, Green Bay/Chicago, Miami/Indianapolis, and Oakland/Seattle. 

	Going into tonight's game, we have 4 people still alive for the money. Larry Campbell, Dave Ryan, Kayne Coulter and Joe Quenet, all who missed 4 games.  Dave, Kayne and Joe picked Baltimore and Larry picked Tennessee. Therefore, if Tennessee wins, then Larry will win outright. If Baltimore wins tonight, then it will come down to total points scored. Dave picked 24 points, Kayne has 29 and Joe had 56. Dave will win with Baltimore and 26 or less points, Kayne will win with Baltimore and between 27 and 42 points, and Joe will win with Baltimore and 43 or more points. 

	We only had 22 entries this weekend, therefore the prize will be $66. This coming week's games will be handed out tomorrow and due Thursday afternoon, since I will be off this Friday. Here are the results from the games with the amount of games each person missed.

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

797,"Guys, I received Harrell's memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and 
the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the 
permits fuel use requirements.  My question is, how does the fuel use compare 
with what Solar says the fuel use should be?  If we can get Solar to provide 
written guarantees and ""UP"" the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the 
fuel value on the permit.  The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use 
beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in 
need of mechanical adjustment.  From their eyes, this would be a strong 
indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some 
merit.  Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado.  

Would you contact Solar and compare their fuel use values with what the 
monitors say the turbine is burning at La Plata? 

Then let me know.  If worse gets to worse, I may be able to use another 
tactic, but only as a last resort.",,,Harrell Solar

807,"Larry,

I spoke with Darron Blackburn regarding the Burger, Crane, and Sonora
accounts.  Darron has told me that the blue fee return sheets indicate that
EOTT submitted zero fees for these three accounts.  Darron indicated that
these sites had either NSPS sources or an active Title V permit.  Therefore,
fees would be required.  A fee would not be required if there was no
intention of operating the sites in the 2002 fiscal year (September 1, 2001
through August 31, 2002).

1. If a fee is owed but the site did not operate in 2000, then EOTT would
owe the minimum fee - $26.
2. If the Title V was not officially terminated prior to Nov.1, then the fee
is required if the source operates in the fiscal year.

Our database shows Burger and Sonora to be out of service.  Therefore, a
2002 fiscal year fee would not be required.  This needs to be communicated
to Mr. Blackburn in writing.  Our database shows Crane to have all
grandfathered tanks.  Therefore, the only trigger for a fee would be an
active Title V permit.  Do you know if the TNRCC has voided the Title V and
if so when?

We have been researching PJM transmission settlement and have found an 
inconsistency in how deals are settled in PJM and 
how they are getting into Enpower.

I would like to propose that any deal for transmission be entered into 
Enpower as documented below.  Please come to me if you 
have any questions.

Volume Management is attempted to set up a process to reconcile these volumes 
on a daily and monthly basis, so bear with us 
until the process is in place and everyone is up to speed.

Thanks,

Rebecca


PJM TRANSMISSION PROCEDURE

Every time an OASIS request is accepted in PJM a deal is entered into 
Enpower...  

 1)  with a demand volume equal to the amount reserved
 2)  demand price of $0.67
 3)  trans volume equal to the volume FLOWED (or expected to flow)
 4)  trans price of $0.48
 5) Comments with the PJM OASIS number for reference (buy and sell 
transaction ids if available)

Examples:

A) If EPMI reserve 100mw of transmission on peak for the whole month, but we 
are not sure if or when we are going to use it, enter 
demand volume of 100mw and trans volume of zero, and then when it is used 
change the trans volume in Scheduling to the amount 
that actually flowed.

B)  If EPMI reserves 50mw for HE8-12 and expects to use it, enter demand 
volume of 50mw and trans volume of 50mw, and then of it 
is cut change the trans volume in Scheduling to the amount that actually 
flowed.",Rebecca,0.67 0.48,PJM Volume Management EPMI 50mw HE8-12

no negative reaction to proceeding in the manner described by this email.  
However, I did get a read from Bill and Lou that certain EOTT bases should be 
touched (first) prior to this change in placement of personnel.  Therefore, I 
am asking Bill (by copy of this email) to work with Lou and come up with a 
list of the names of folks that we should visit with prior to formerly 
getting this process started.  Bottom line: this is a good idea and one that 
we probably will do, however, prior to formerly beginning posting of the job,

833,"With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia 
concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline 
Company offers the following response:

Pipeline Integrity.  With the construction of the evaporation ponds over 
Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored 
the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.  This includes a more frequent 
inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking 
potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present.  
Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the 
potential of pipeline corrosion.  As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has 
cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline 
coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the 
evaporation ponds.   The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern 
are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system 
at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also 
allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art 
monitoring and detection. 

Noise Issue.  In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern 
conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels.  
This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures 
which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso 
Station.  Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post 
noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above 
those levels mandated by FERC.  In the event of operational noise levels 
exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to 
performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post 
noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC.

Decrepancy of trailer park residents.  In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was 
stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the 
adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study, 
but ""more like 35 trailers"".  The number of mobile home residences currrently 
in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.  Transwestern's trailer park 
residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job 
market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low.  
The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job 
economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature 
of the residences.  It should also be noted that during the time that the 
trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the 
operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the 
operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments 
and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the 
trailer park residents.  It was actually noted that many of the spaces 
normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.  This unsanitary 
condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.  The 
NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.     ","Richard Oreane Garcia

835,"PG&E Fights Toxin in Gas Stream, Movie Fallout

     Sunday's Oscar winners have nothing on San Francisco's venerable Gran 
Dame of
     combination energy utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., whose film 
career and notoriety
     seem destined to win increasing Hollywood scrutiny if not gold 
statuettes. 

     Look no further than your local first-run movie theaters and the 
real-life drama, ""Erin
     Brockovich,"" taking the actual name of the latest heroine to put PG&E's 
familiar logo in
     the klieg lights. Unfortunately for PG&E, toxins like chromium or PCBs 
in association
     with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas. 

     Just as the new movie, starring Julia Roberts, hit the theaters earlier 
this month, a new
     real-life problem confronted the combination utility with contaminates 
getting into the
     southern part of its California gas transmission system. 

     The movie is the story of a legal assistant ","Erin

837,"I will be holding a conference call today at 11:00 AM (Central time) for the 
purpose of relating some information I have received from Rod Boshcee of 
PG&E.  The conference number is 1-800-991-9019, passcode 6000796.  Rod left a 
very friendly detailed message on my voice mail yesterday afternoon related 
to the upcoming proposed shutdown and testing of the separators at Topock 
(which they previously agreed would be done around September 11 or 12.  He 
asked on the voice mail that I give him a call back and let him know what our 
decision is as soon as possible.

The following will attempt to summarize his voice mail message and will be 
the subject of our call today:
Rod stated that when we were together at Flagstaff in July we had decided to 
again take the system down and sample the separators around September 11 and 
12.
He said PG&E has continued to monitor their unit and have found nothing new 
since the June 29 test.
Rod also said that they have gotten consistent numbers downstream since June 
29 and everything seems stabilized.
He said that PG&E is ""happy"" with the operation of the separators and they 
seem to be doing the job that TW had said they would do.
Rod said that PG&E would go along with TW's thoughts on it, but they were 
wondering if it was really necessary to take the system down in mid-September 
or not since things were looking good?  He said they could go either way on 
it.
Rod closed by saying that they still had some concern about the sterility of 
the 1800' of pipe that connects TW's Meter Run with PG&E's Topock Compressor 
Station.  However, it seemed to be OK for now and they would have no other 
thoughts on it as long as the numbers stay consistently low on their side.
He asked that we let him know what we want to do as soon as possible so 
scheduling will not be a problem.

I would propose that we discuss this matter and then we can call him back and 
furnish our recommendation.  The cooperative tone of his call is something we 
want to continue to build upon and I do want us to be promptly responsive in 
that regard.  Thanks, John",Rod Boshcee John,1-800-991-9019,"PG&E TW Topock Compressor 
Station"
838,"I just spent about 40 minutes on the phone with my counterpart discussing the 
upcoming meeting.   The call was cordial.  A couple of items that came up 
worth passing on are as follows:

 There is some expectation in PG&E to decon the compressors.  They may not 
wish to do so right now but maybe soon.  There is also discussion of these 
being out of service for up to a couple of months.  I passed along the idea 
that it is probably best to simply monitor the situation and the PCB matters 
may well take care of themselves through routine maintenance activities and 
continued operation.  No official decon processes exist as far as were are 
aware.  There are no restrictions on their continued use exist at that 
location.  PG&E may be considering employee exposure or continued source of 
contamination as issues why they want to decon. We should expect to this to 
come up during the meeting.  I do not think that this type of decon would 
necessarily be in line with the standard for reimbursement under our 
operating agreement - which is ""reasonable action, measured in accordance 
with commonly accepted standards of care and practice in the natural gas 
pipeline industry in California.""  I'm not aware of SoCal engaging in any 
such action even though their system was highly impacted by PCBs.   I did not 
bring this standard up but we should be aware of it and recommend monitoring 
before any decisions are made.  My counterpart did acknowledge that even when 
the Long Term facilities eliminated the delivery problem, that we may well 
have continued issues with respect to the PCBs in the station and the 15 
miles of pipe downstream for some lengthy period of time.  PG&E did not 
appear to be contemplating any pigging or decon of this section of the system.

 PG&E may be looking for some more comfort on the question of ""source 
control"".  We have said that this situation is relatively unique to the 
Topock Lateral but we have had some minor hits elsewhere recently.  We should 
be in a position to explain why the remainder of the system is not a problem 
and even if it should be why the Long term facilities should be able to 
handle any concerns.

",,,PCB PG&E SoCal Long Term
839,"After the Topock line has been cleaned and placed back in service, I 
recommend immediate flushing with diesel.
The existing Selexol tank and injection system can be used for this purpose. 
HYSIM simulations verify the existing high pressure injection pump is a good 
fit for the quantity of diesel to be added on a continuous basis, 
(approximately 1 B/D).  Inject  1 or 2 barrels of diesel in front of each pig 
to begin with.  I would buy diesel No. 2 because it has a wider boiling point 
range than No. 1.  The diesel should be analyzed for PCB content  before we 
purchase /inject.

The above guideline should be adjusted based on the actual volume of liquids 
seen at the meter station filter separator.  If you can keep a small but 
continuous amount of free liquids at this separator , the gas will be 
saturated with heavy hydrocarbons which will dilute and flush PG&E's 
downstream system.

1 to 2 Barrel per day of diesel injected into 200 MMSCF/D has a major effect 
on the C7+ concentration  in the gas stream and on the hydrocarbon dew point. 
Most of the hydrocarbons in diesel  are naturally ocurring to some extent in 
natural gas. The carbon number for diesel ranges from about C10 to C 20 with 
a corresponding boiling point of 350 oF to 650 oF.  It is anticipated that 
some of the heavier hydrocarbons in the C18 to C20 range will  drop out along 
with compressor oil carryover to substantially increase the amount of liquid 
PG&E sees in their downstream drips.  The net effect of this is a substantial 
reduction of the PCB concentration.  I would expect that after 30 to 60 days 
of continuous injection the PCB contaminant level should drop by an order of 
magnitude.

The reason I would not inject Selexol after the pipeline has been cleaned is 
because you would  leave a finite quantity of Selexol coating the pipeline

Sixth Interstate Natural Gas Facility-Planning Seminar
""Presentation of Staff's Findings""
October 26, 2001
Washington, DC

Link to ""Ideas"" document:  http://www.ferc.gov/gas/stakeholder.pdf
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
	
Comments due on pre-filing stakeholder ""Ideas"" document November 9
Overriding theme to all Action Ideas is ""earlier is better""
Pre-filing process has a new docket prefix (PF) and is underway; explained in some detail
Staff seems to be looking for best practices, possibly even a vehicle for industry-wide (and public) sharing
		
Highlights

Though FERC's Office of Energy Projects intends to hold more public and industry outreach seminars, this sixth seminar was the last of this series; OEP presented their final draft of ""Ideas for Better Stakeholder Involvement in the Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Planning Pre-Filing Process: Industry, Agencies, Citizens and FERC Staff.""  

Following this presentation, there is one last round of comments on the document due to the Outreach Team by November 9th.  The Outreach Team's goal is to release a final document by the end of this year.  Overall, the Team wants to know if they're findings are on target, and they have asked for comments that include edits, additions or omissions.  To note, however, is that ""The Ideas"" is seen as a ""living document"" by OEP, and it will be changed and updated on an ongoing basis as better practices and ideas emerge.  Again Rich Hoffmann stated that there is no intention for any of this to be included in a rulemaking or policy statement (I believed him this time).   Also, Rich clarified that ""we recognize these ideas have to be customized for every project.""  [This is, in fact, why the document was not issued as ""guidelines"" -- industry argued they would become de facto requirements.]

For comment on the document itself, we will look for ETS recommendations from interested groups (there is a link to the document above).  At the end of this memo, there is also a list of general questions from the Outreach Team.  Please send replies or comments on those questions, as well as the ""Ideas"" document, to me by November 7th for aggregation and inclusion in informal comments to go to the Outreach team (comments will not be filed with the Secretary).

FERC Staff Presentation

The Gas Outreach Team (Rich Hoffmann, Lauren O'Donnell, Jeff Shenot, Howard Wheeler) presented their findings of Action Options for the four major stakeholder sectors: Pipeline Industry, Agency (local, state and resource agencies), Citizen and FERC Staff.  There is a slide presentation that should be made available online soon.  

There was some Q&A, but Staff was particularly eager to hear examples of how some of these ideas have been implemented successfully and if any ""best practices"" have emerged since the Outreach Team began these discussions.  One worry we have with Staff's preoccupation with best practices is that, at some point, they may want to formalize that idea though the publication of best practices.  They seem to be looking for a vehicle to collect and communicate best practices from pipeline company to pipeline company, and to the public.  Similar to the idea of publishing guidelines which then become de facto requirements, ""best practices"" can evolve into requirements as well, and such practices vary widely in use and effectiveness across different systems, projects and regions of the country.  Industry may want to protect the importance of variability and customization of approach based on what we know about certain regions and populations.

Some points of interest from the discussion include the emphasis by FERC Staff that pipeline companies appear to be most successful when they get full management support from the top at the very beginning of project development, there is a proactive company-wide philosophy, and the project team includes various parts of the company from the outset (i.e., include public affairs from the beginning as well as engineering, and have them communicate with each other regularly through the team).

NEPA Pre-Filing Process

Attesting to the emerging role of the NEPA Pre-filing Process, there is a new docket prefix, ""PF,"" instituted to allow for public access to information on pre-filed projects.  This process is not an expedited approach that takes less time at FERC, but instead overlays the company's timeline with the FERC NEPA timeline in the development and assessment of the project.  This allows for a certificate sooner for the company in relation to their own project development process.  As an example, a NEPA Pre-Filing process could begin before the exact route has been determined, though the project must be well-defined -- while the company is holding public meetings and choosing the route, FERC could begin the scoping process.  According to OEP's assessment, this could shift the NEPA process back as much as seven months.  Under this scenario, once the company files for its certificate application, a final certificate could be issued in under ten months.

In order to use the pre-filing process, companies must meet certain qualifications.  First, a company should be prepared to fund a third party contractor to help FERC Staff prepare the certificate and NEPA requirements.  Also, there must be a real written commitment to identify and resolve issues.  And the company must be able to demonstrate that the other major NEPA organizations are prepared to cooperate on development of the NEPA assessment.  To qualify to use the NEPA pre-filing, the company files a formal request with the OEP Director answering any concerns FERC Staff may have about the project and the outlook for a successful pre-filing process.  Once accepted, that would trigger the PF docket assignment.  Currently, only the NiSource Greenbriar project is utilizing this process.


Follow-Up Questions from FERC

Along with any comments we may have on the ""Ideas"" document itself, FERC Staff distributed a set of three questions for consideration and/or comment from industry and the public.  The questions follow  -- note that Staff is particularly eager to collect positive anecdotes on how these ideas are already working on projects:

Part 1: Are we on target?  [Please let us know of any additions, omissions, or editorial changes you recommend for ""Ideas for Better Stakeholder Involvement...""]
Part 2:  Ideas for implementation  [Please give us your good ideas about how to put the ideas discussed here today to work.  This can be for projects you are involved with or for other projects of which you are aware.]
Part 3: Examples of successful implementation [Please describe examples of how using these concepts helped make your experience or involvement with a project better.]

Effective Trading and Risk Strategies for
the Online Energy Market

Now in its 3rd year, this is THE conference where the European Energy industry talks about the business of energy trading. Case studies from traders, brokers, online exchanges and energy companies to help you stay at the forefront of the exploding energy trading market!

UBS Warburg estimates that profits from European power trading alone will top $2.4 billion in 2002.	 
Add natural gas and oil and you're looking at a huge pot of pure profit, only available to those companies that know how to best take advantage of the rise of deregulation and online trading in the European market.	 

Speakers at this event will include:

Dynegy, Altra Energy, OM Group, Powergen, Bergen-Energie, Amsterdam Power Exchange, RWE Trading, ENDESA, Utility Exchange, El Paso, SchlumbergerSema, TXU, and more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c45a317>...	 

Recent efforts at deregulating the energy market in the European Union, combined with the rise of online energy exchanges, is set to make the next few months one of the most challenging and opportunity-filled period the energy sector has seen. And with the American energy companies getting involved in the European energy trading scene, it is set to become a whole new ball game.

Do you know where you stand?

DEREGULATION? Hear about the latest developments in European energy deregulation and what opportunities they open up for your company.

RISK MANAGEMENT? Multiple commodities, counter-party, delivery logistics, multiple platforms... the risks are almost endless. Learn the latest strategies that will help you navigate through the online trading minefield.

LIQUIDITY AND TRUST? Where can you find the energy products you need, and who can you trust to deliver them?

SOFTWARE AND SECURITY? As more and more trading is done online, do you have the right software systems in place and are you sure they're secure?

PRICE DISCOVERY? How to make sure you're making the best trades whether you're trading on one exchange or many.

PLUS... a full networking programme to help you meet and do business with the people who can make a difference to your future.

1/1/2001 - 4/15/2001 - VP Reg & Gov. Affairs - Co. 0366
4/15/2001 - 12/16/2001 - Title change to VP Gas Logistics - no company change
12/17/2001 - 12/31/2001 - FMLA Leave - no company change

1/1/2002 - to present company change to 179E.

I have nothing indicating a company change for 2001.

Fran,

On Monday, March 4, I received an email from Shelley Corman regarding her receipt of 2 W-2s.  One from Enron Corp and one from Enron Opns Svcs. Co.  In researching this, I talked with Valley Confer in payroll and what we find is that Shelley's Tax company changed on 1/1/2001 - 4/15/2001 from 011 Enron Corp to 0366 Enron Opns Svcs and on 4/16/2001 - 12/31/2001 the Tax company changed back to co. 011.  Currently, her tax company is 011 Enron Corp.  

If memory serves me correctly, Tax Co. 011 is for employees on deferred compensation. Could this Shelley's case?   I am asking that you all follow up with Shelley regarding the change in Tax Company's as I have exhausted my research.

Power Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference

March 26-28 2002, Atlanta, Georgia

OVERVIEW

This conference will highlight the commonalties and common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the enterprise.  The conference will emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing process.  The processes of Asset management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset owner.

Ancillary Services Conference

April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado

OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

 Managing Distribution in a Restructured Environment

May 14-17, 2002, Westminster, CO

OVERVIEW

Managing an electric distribution company, or any part of a distribution company, is a difficult endeavor in today's operating environment.  Customers and regulators demand reliable service.  Stockholders require more return from capital expenditures.  Training and retention of capable employees has become a major concern.   Selection of the investments and expenses that provide the most return is a continuous challenge.  With increasing constraints, and more-demanding performance expectations, distribution managers need new ideas and concepts to lead their companies.

 

""Managing Distribution in a Restructured Environment"" focuses on solutions to the issues that have made electric distribution such a challenging business.   It covers a full spectrum of topics, from distribution planning, load management services, reliability, customer relationship management, and management of aging assets.   Details from case studies are presented from utilities around the country.  Leaders in the distribution business present both novel and proven concepts, which participants can take home and apply in their business.  Coupled with a pre-conference workshop ""Maximizing Performance Under Budget Constraints"" and a post-conference workshop ""Implementing Reliability-Centered Maintenance to Reduce Costs"", the conference gives valuable insights and the edge that participants need to be successful.

2ND ANNUAL 
FUELCELL 
INVESTOR
 A Unique Networking Opportunity To Talk Directly To CEOs Of Virtually All Publicly Traded FC Companies And Other Executives Whose Decisions Can Change The Future Of The Industry!
March 26 - 27, 2002 w The Roosevelt Hotel w New York, NY

The rapidly expanding fuel industry was recently given yet another boost, as the Bush administration last week abandoned a multi-billion dollar, eight-year project to develop high-mileage gasoline-fueled vehicles and instead is throwing its support behind a plan to develop hydrogen-based fuel cells to power the cars of the future.


With the highest possible level of speakers in the fuel cell industry, this summit offers unparallel networking potential. Some major blue chip companies will be presenting, among them Air Products, Dupont, GE Equity, General Motors, Ford and Morgan Stanley.



This event will be a unique opportunity to hear from and talk directly to CEOs of virtually all publicly traded FC companies: Walter (Chip) Schroeder, Proton Energy; H. Frank Gibbard, H Power; Jerry D. Leitman, FuelCell Energy; Bill Acker, Mechanical Technology; Stephen S. Tang, Millennium Cell; Pierre Rivard, Hydrogenics; Robert K. Lifton, Medis Technology; John Donohue, DCH Technology, plus CFOs and Directors of several more fuel cell companies, including Plug Power, Ceramic Fuel Cells and many others.

Big Banks Dominate iDTV - Report
Benjamin Ensor, December 2001
Related to: Financial Services UK Market Focus; UK Internet Commerce;
UK On-line Finance
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,11725,00.html

     Leading financial firms rushed to pioneer iDTV in the UK -- but
     low uptake and tech limitations prevent short-term ROI. Big banks
     will outlast rivals by combining interactive advertising with
     walled-garden services.

Managing Auto's Demand Chain - Report
Baba Shetty, December 2001
Related to: Automotive Market Focus
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,12211,00.html

     Auto demand chain costs devastate OEM and dealer profits. By
     2003, leading OEMs will unveil second-generation locate-to-order
     systems -- not to sell online, but to dramatically reduce demand
     chain costs.

Trade On-line; Healthcare On-line; On-line Retail; Commerce Technology
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,11183,00.html

     Sell-side firms struggle with complex -- and expensive -- content
     management challenges. To succeed, firms must either master
     application integration and content classification or find a hosted
     solutions provider.

http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,11984,00.html

     Today's stand-alone IT can't manage externally sourced and
     business-owned technology. To thrive, firms will adopt exT
     structures to manage and deliver technology that drives measurable
     business value.

http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,13322,00.html

     Site managers struggle to bring the quality of search in line
     with rising expectations. Questing for all-in-one search doesn't
     help -- firms must optimize engines to help users locate products
     or get help or find documents.

The Secret To Device Success - Report
Bruce Kasrel, December 2001
Related to: Media Market Focus
http://www.forrester.com/ER/Research/Report/0,1338,13493,00.html

     Device makers should: 1) focus on a common, cumbersome behavior,
     and 2) maximize usability, not technology. These criteria give PC
     makers an edge in new devices.

Frank Osburn, Director of Facility and Operational Records, will move from Engineering and Construction to the Pipeline Integrity organization. Frank will bring the Document Control Team, the Mapping Team, and the Project Completion Team, as well as be responsible for Operational Compliance (Meagan Bange) and the PHD / PDMS group under Larry Abbott. We believe this entire group is critical to Pipeline Safety and Integrity and will help ensure consistent strategies.

Max Brown, currently Director of Corrosion and Risk Management, will add Pipeline Integrity Program responsibilities to his role. Max will add Ronny Davenport, Mike Ames, and John Millar to his Corrosion / Pipeline Integrity organization. This group will be working closely with the ETS Area VP's and Region Directors to ensure our Pipeline Integrity initiatives are communicated and on track. 

David Johnson will continue in the critical role as VP of Pipeline Safety, with Michael Crump as Director. The Pipeline Safety group will consist of Merlin Moseman, Pat Vaughan, and Lisa Choquette (RPT), with two Pipeline Safety Engineer vacancies currently open and posted.

895,"Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. 
Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)
has been the only pipeline into this market.  


NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 
47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored 
by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will 
add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis 
market. 

""The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing 
strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets 
currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by 
adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,"" said Richard D. 
Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. 

The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is 
scheduled for completion in June of 2002. 

NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and 
storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, 
which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In 
addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation 
agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf 
Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. 

The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area 
that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company 
[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, 
president of Illinois Power. ""This new connection to Illinois Power's system 
will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the 
metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point 
to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the 
area. 

""The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy 
provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,"" said Deb 
Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest 
from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season 
will determine the final scope of the project. 

""With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the 
St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of 
interest,"" said Macdonald. ""We anticipate a strong response, however, given 
the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
generation."" 

Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business 
development, at (630) 691-3347.

Ancillary Services Conference

 

April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado

 

OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

 

The brochure for the Ancillary Services Conference, April 10-12, 2002, Wyndham Hotel - Tech Center, Denver, CO can be obtained by clicking on the link below:

Randy Lord with building maintenance advised us that HL&P had a switch problem that caused the Enron building to lose all commercial power. The UPS systems switched to the auxillary generators and there was minimal impact to the computer rooms and Gas Control Center during the outage. The backup chiller on the roof did not kick in automatically and building maintenance performed the switch manually. The computer rooms warmed up a bit, but not enough to be a problem. They plan to bring contractors in tomorrow morning to determine what the problem was with the backup chiller. The Gas Logistics business systems did lose one server but there was minimal to no business impact. Gas Control was not impacted. 

We will check with Randy tomorrow morning to see if HL&P has determined the root cause of their equipment failure. Let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and ""salesy.""  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

979,"damn yer funny.  hey, what's the weather like up there?",,,
980,"All,
Here is an updated program with a laundry list of speakers.  This afternoon at
5:30/2:30 we need to:

1)  Make introductions

2)  Agree on general format

3)  Agree on date.  Bill prefers October so we need to resolve that.

4)  Agree on initial list of speakers.

5)  Determine contacts most likely to get the speakers to accept, and assign
calling list.

For selecting speakers, Lee and I have discussed a cascading selection method
(in the spirit of cascading electricity ancillary service auctions I suppose) 
by
which we try to get a commitment from our top choice then select our second
choice to ensure balance with the first, and each step of the way try to 
ensure
the next selection provides balance to the existing slate.  Since we'll all be
on the phone together our first step should still be to establish a top list 
and
assign responsibility for calling a few people.

Talk to you soon!  Bill can you set up the call and send around the call-in
number? Thanks.

web based helpdesk system we are getting very close.  Haas Computing
Services (HCS) is pleased to announce the on-line Service Request
System.  Help is now just a click away at
http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu/ Book mark it now or, if on site, just
type the word =0F""helpdesk=0F"" in the ""Location"" or ""Address"" field of your=
 web
browser and you'll be immediately transported to the Service Request System=
.

It couldn't be simpler=0F. no need for email delays, voice mail or busy
signals.  Phoning and email are now completely optional.  Any Haas faculty,
staff or student can now open and track his or her own service request
on-line.

As you launch the web site, you will need to sign in using your NT login
and password.  Once logged in, you can enter a request, check the status of
requests, update your helpdesk user profile, view the entire job queue, or
check the queue for your department.  The system is intuitive and is
described in detail on the homepage.  A brief summary of the request entry
process is included below.

What=0F's different about this helpdesk system is that it puts the customer=
 in
the driver's seat.  You will be able to submit a request, or follow up on a
request whenever you need to.  Your request will be captured in the
database in your own words so nothing is lost in translation.  The web
based system permits you to enter a request from anywhere you have access
to a browser, even if your email is not working.  It will permit you to see
the entire history of your service request with the assigned technician's
progress updates.  You can also see requests made by other customers in
your department or in the Haas community.

What remains the same with this new system is the same high quality service
provided by the support staff.  You will still have a single point of
contact for requesting technical services.  Both Haas Media Services and
the Marketing and Communications Web Team have joined HCS in using this
system to track their service requests.  Routine service requests will be
assigned to a support staff member within one business day of entry.  The
person to whom the request is assigned will still be contacting the
customer within one business day to initiate problem resolution.  Higher
priority requests will receive expedited service.

To take advantage of this new system, customers must be HCS account holders
(e.g. Haas students, faculty or staff) and have web browser capable of
running java scripts.  We recommend using either Netscape or Internet
Explorer version 4.0 and above.

Haas Computing Services staff have developed and tested a system that we
believe suits your needs.  We are pleased with the increased accessibility
and heightened direct customer-to-technician interaction this new on-line
system provides.  We trust that you, our customers will also find the
system useful and we welcome your feedback on how we can further improve
our service.

Entering a Request:

Enter ""helpdesk"" in your browsers URL box or go to
http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu .  Login using your NT Haas domain login
and password.  Click on ""Enter Request"".  The system will default to your
name, or you can enter the last name of another person for whom you need to
enter a request.  You'll need to enter a descriptive subject line and
provide some details regarding the kind of service you need.  After you
have finished entering your request be sure to click the submit button at
the bottom of the page.  Once you request is submitted it appears in the
helpdesk queue.  From there our helpdesk operator will assign your request
to the appropriate person.",http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu/ Haas,,"Haas Computing

know if that was?a full-time elected position or  whether he would be on call 
to serve as caseloads determine.? He was  president of the California Trial 
Lawyers Association (now California  Association of Consumer Attorneys) 
around 1990 and is currently chairman  of the board of trustees of Humphreys 
School of Law in Stockton.
?
He's been involved in at least a?couple of high profile case in  the Central 
Valley, including the case against Ford detailed in the  articles below 
(apparently, the verdict was later overturned due to juror  misconduct and a 
TV show tainted the $290 million verdict).? He was  also involved in a highly 
publicized case in which the Catholic  Diocese?of Stockton?was ordered to pay 
$30 million as the result  of molestations by a priest.
?
He's well known in trial lawyer circles, and has been a leader in  CTLA/CAOC 
for years.? I'm sure that includes working hard to raise  funds for 
atttorney-backed initiatives (including insurance issues) and  candidates.?

Astronomical damage awards set a bad precedent 	
				
?		by JIM LAFFERTY 		?
?		Lubbock Avalanche Journal ??Saturday, November 13,  1999		?
?		?		?
?		[IMAGE]E-Mail this  article???[IMAGE]Printer-friendly version		?
?		?		?
?		MODESTO, Calif. - Now high is up? ?
		?
		That's the  question that thousands of giddy personal injury lawyers are 
asking  themselves in the wake, of two astronomical punitive damage awards 
handed  out by California juries within three days of each other in July.  ?
		?
		In one of the judgments, Modesto jurors ordered Ford  Motor Co. to pay $290 
million in punitive damages to a young man whose  mother, father and brother 
were killed when he tipped over his 1978 Bronco  on Father's Day 1993. ?
		?
		At the time of the accident,  Juan Ramon Romo, then 19, had been driving for 
a lengthy period of time,  so long, in fact, that everyone else in the Bronco 
- his mother and  father, a brother and two sisters had fallen asleep. Going 
slightly over  the speed limit on an interstate highway, Romo attempted 
illegally to pass  another vehicle on the right. ?
		?
		When the other driver  decided to move back into the right lane, Romo swerved 
left and rolled  over. His mother, father and brother were killed; he and his 
two sisters  survived. ?
		?
		The $290 million judgment in the Romo case  was the second largest ever 
entered against a U.S. car manufacturer, yet  it received little media 
attention outside the immediate Modesto area.  ?
		?
		Hardly surprising, perhaps, since only three days  before a Las Angeles jury 
had set the punitive damage bar impossibly high  by ordering General Motors 
to pay a staggering punitive damage award of  $4.9 billion. ?
		?
		By way of a yardstick, that amount  surpasses the combined Gross National 
Product of Afghanistan and Albania.  Almost obscured by the astonishing 
generosity of the jurors in Los Angeles  and Modesto, was a salient point 
that still sends shivers through  corporate defense lawyers around the 
country: By any objective criteria,  neither Ford nor General Motors appeared 
to bear any responsibility for  the accidents. ?
		?
		In the Los Angeles case, Patricia  Anderson, her four children and a family 
friend were stopped at a red  light in her 1979 Chevy Malibu on Christmas Eve 
1993. A drunken driver  traveling at 70 mph slammed his car into the Malibu's 
rear end. The  collision ruptured the Malibu's gas tank and ignited the 
spilled fuel.  Mrs. Anderson's four children suffered severe burns.  ?
		?
		When police tested the drunken driver he registered a  blood alcohol content 
of 0.20 - twice the legal limit for drivers in  California. ?
		?
		Similarly, in the Modesto case, driver  error and misjudgment on the part of 
Romo clearly appeared to be the cause  of the accident. ?
		?
		But Romo's lawyer, Lawrence Drivon,  immediately blamed the deaths on the 
Bronco, which he said was susceptible  to rollover, and had a defectively 
designed roof. ?
		?
		Yet  the Bronco exceeded all federal safety standards for roof strength in 
1978  by more than 100 percent and, in fact, exceeds the 1999 standard by 
more  than 30 percent. ?
		?
		Romo's Bronco also exceeded all  federal rollover standards for 1978 model., 
and federal accident data show  the Ford Broncos rollover rate was no higher 
than that of other SUVs.  ?
		?
		It's open to question whether the Bronco had been  properly maintained prior 
to the accident. The vehicle had been on the  road for 15 years, had numerous 
changes in ownership and had nearly  200,000 miles on the odometer. ?
		?
		In addition, Drivon  engaged in conduct that borders on jury tampering - 
mailing to each juror  a copy of his book, 'The Civil War on Consumer 
Rights,"" whose main thesis  is that large American corporations, like Ford, 
are attempting to close  ""the courthouse doors"" to average Americans by 
pressing for judicial  reforms. In the book, Drivon devotes an entire chapter 
to Ford's alleged  misdeeds. ?
		?
		In part because of Drivon's behavior, a  California judge granted Ford's 
motion to set aside the punitive damage  part of the verdict and ordered a 
new trial. Among other things, he cited  improper discussions among the 
jurors that prejudiced deliberations.  ?
		?
		But Ford could be entering double jeopardy with a new  trial. Drivon has 
indicated he will seek to raise the initial punitive  award threefold to more 
than $1 billion. With a sympathetic jury, that  could happen. ?
		?
		Damage award, of a few hundred million  here and a few hundred million there 
are still unusual, but California is  a national trendsetter. ?
		?
		If juries elsewhere start  emulating the ones in Los Angeles and Modesto, our 
now booming economy  could well begin to sputter. ?

on an IEP call today:

The meeting was attended by a lot of folks of all stripes.
Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants 
to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on 
board.
Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to 
consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later 
today)
One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting.
The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous 
""prudence"" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts.
Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting.
Much discussion of what California does on the gas side,  i.e., set an 
objective benchmark price; if the utility beats it, they profit; if they do 
worse, they take the hit.  The utility, under this framework, has broad 
flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.  (FYI:  
Coincidentally, I suggested this approach in very broad terms--pointing to 
the fact that it's already successfully in use on the gas side--during a 
panel discussion that I participated in yesterday at the California Energy 
Markets conference.)
The utilities told Rod Wright that they did not want, nor did they have the 
expertise, to get back into the generation business.",Sandi Dave Mike Joe Ronan Calpine Wright Loretta Lynch Rod Wright,,"FYI the California Energy

discussed during our 11:30 call yesterday.  My goal was to be comprehensive, 
even if it sacrifices brevity.  My goal was also to put something together

Overview of how we ended up in this crisis--include EPSA paper on crisis, EEI 
paper on crisis, and 1-2 articles from CA papers on the crisis.
Load growth--California (show in terms of MWs, not percentages) and in WSCC.  
Point is to show how load growth in California has been extraordinary 
relative to historical growth, show how entire west is growing.
Generation additions--show how California and west did not keep pace with 
load growth.
Consumption per capita or other measurements. 
Rate comparisons--show how west has had experienced substantial rate 
increases.  Compare actual increase in California to other states.
MRW Study--show how $1 billion can be produced by 10% increase.  Show how 
increases experienced in--e.g., Nevada can produce revenues.  
Transmission takeover analysis--show $39 billion price tag, compare with 
school funding.
Solutions--include the Brulte or Herzberg piece.


I would add the following pieces as well (just not sure where):

Discussion of federal jurisdiction over transmission and 
generation--summarize FERC orders, including investigation.
Why price caps aren't a solution.

Israel's main retaliation against an onslaught of suicide bombs was political: it closed Orient House, the Palestinians' de facto headquarters in East Jerusalem. It also briefly sent tanks into Jenin, threatened Beit Jalla and assassinated a Fatah fighter. 
In Macedonia political parties of the rival ethnic groups signed a NATO-inspired peace accord that promises ethnic Albanians something closer to equality in the state. Ethnic-Albanian rebels promised to hand over their weapons, to be collected, under the deal, by a NATO force. NATO decided to send an advance group of 400 soldiers even though its conditions for sending the full force - including a durable ceasefire - had not yet been met.
Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, angered China and other countries it fought in the second world war by visiting the Yasukuni shrine for the war dead, including some condemned as war criminals. 
The Bank of Japan took surprise measures to give the faltering economy a much- needed boost by easing monetary policy. The move met with approval: the Nikkei 225 index flew up by nearly 4% in a day. Revised figures showed that Japan's GDP rose slightly in the first quarter of the year instead of falling. 
The euro hit a five-month high, rising above 90 cents against the dollar. The IMF gave a warning that America's current-account deficit was unsustainable and that the dollar was likely to weaken further. The dollar also slid against the yen. 
America's economy suffered. Industrial production fell for the tenth month in a row to end 3.2% down in the year to July. Germany's economy is also in trouble. The Bundesbank estimated that GDP was flat in the second quarter. 
The British government suspended political institutions in Northern Ireland, after Unionists there refused to accept the IRA's talk of a ""scheme"" - no details, no date - for weapons-decommissioning as a substitute for action. The IRA promptly withdrew its scheme. 
Three suspected members of the IRA were arrested in Bogota. Colombian army chiefs said that they had been giving bomb-making courses to the FARC guerrillas. 
While Spain's central and Basque-region politicians swapped insults over the regional police force's willingness to fight 
ETA 
terrorists, ETA supporters publicly commemorated four of them blown up by their own bomb a year ago. 
In Turkey, one of the country's most popular politicians, Tayyib Erdogan, a former mayor of Istanbul, set up a new Islamic party. Meanwhile, civilians are openly questioning the political role of the armed forces, determined enemies of religious influence in politics. 
On Saudi Arabian television, three more Britons confessed to carrying out bomb attacks. The incidents are all thought to be connected with the illegal trade in alcohol. 
For his second term, Iran's president, Muhammad Khatami, disappointed reformists by largely reappointing his old cabinet of moderate loyalists. 
American and British aircraft twice attacked anti-aircraft sites in southern Iraq. Syria's prime minister paid a ground-breaking three-day visit to Baghdad. 
The Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, marked independence day by blaming Pakistan for wrecking relations between the two countries and ""believing it can gain Kashmir through terrorism"". 
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf promised a general election for October 2002, but it looked likely that the country would stay under military control. 
China suspended Seeking Truth, a leftist magazine that attacked a decision to allow capitalists to join the Communist Party. 
Congressman Gary Condit rejected calls for his resignation by two Californian newspapers over his ""abhorrent"" conduct in the case of a missing intern, Chandra Levy. 
State governments expressed concern that federal legislation on patients' rights would offer less protection to consumers than state laws already in place. 
A Justice Department report on the Los Alamos spy inquiry said that the FBI's investigation was deeply flawed from the beginning, had looked into the wrong crime and had ignored some possible suspects. 
A United States federal judge ruled that controversial snapshots of Barbie, an iconic plastic doll, were protected by the photographer's free-speech rights. Mattel, which makes the dolls, plans to appeal. 
After several days of talks, officials from Argentina were reportedly close to an agreement with the IMF over a new loan aimed at calming continued fears of a debt default or devaluation. 
Meanwhile, Brazil slipped towards recession. Its economy shrank by nearly 1% in the second quarter compared with the first. 
Cuba's Fidel Castro watched as Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela inaugurated a 680km (425-mile) electricity-transmission line linking their two countries. 
Kenya's parliament threw out an anti-corruption bill despite a first-time visit from the president, Daniel arap Moi, to encourage it through. Rejecting the bill puts in doubt millions of dollars in aid. Opponents argued that the bill was not tough enough. 
As the situation in Zimbabwe worsened, the Southern Africa Development Community took away the chairmanship of its defence committee from Robert Mugabe and said they were worried about the ""spillover effect"" of the troubles there. Attacks continued on around 100 white-owned farms. Four journalists from the main independent newspaper were arrested but released by a court. 
A triumph for family values: under pressure from the pope himself, Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo, from Zambia, agreed in Rome to abandon his South Korean wife, married in a Moonie ceremony in May, and ""return to the church"". I'm pregnant, he's been drugged, said she. 
The relationship between Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Telekom became frosty after the bank disposed of shares in the telecoms giant worth around euro1 billion ($880m) on behalf of an unnamed seller. Coincidentally, Deutsche Bank issued a research report, which recommended purchasing Deutsche Telekom shares around the time of the sale. 
Morgan Grenfell's name looked likely to disappear after 163 years in investment banking. Deutsche Bank, which acquired Morgan Grenfell some 12 years ago, intends to fold Morgan Grenfell Private Equity into its own private equity division, DB Capital Partners. 
Bayer, a German drug company, said that it was considering a co-operative venture for its drug business with a larger pharmaceutical company; a sell-off could follow. It had previously announced the withdrawal of an anti-cholesterol treatment. That will wipe up to $650m ($590m) off full-year profit and result in the loss of 5,000 jobs. 
Profits fell at UBS by 26% in the latest quarter compared with a year ago. Shares in Switzerland's biggest bank rose; profits had been expected to fall further. Citigroup, the world's biggest financial conglomerate, said that it would cut 3,500 jobs over the coming year to bolster slowing profits. 
The IMF and the World Bank decided to shorten to two days September's annual meeting in Washington, DC, fearing a repeat of the violence witnessed at a recent G8 summit in Genoa. Anti-globalisation protesters claimed a victory in the fight against global capitalism but said that they would turn up and protest anyway. 
US Airways became the latest airline to reveal that it was suffering from the economic downturn and the decline in business travel. It issued a profit warning, saying that losses for the next quarter will exceed $160m. 
Blue-chip companies were glum on both sides of the Atlantic. Continued huge losses and an ever-dwindling share price persuaded Mark Schneider to quit as chairman and chief executive of UPC, a Dutch cable firm. Enron, the world's largest energy trader, lost its president and chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling. He quit the American power giant for personal reasons after just six months in the job. 
Some executives who were ""let go"" recently had cause for celebration. Michael Bonsignore, former chief executive at Honeywell International, will receive $9m as a separation payment, as well as a variety of perks including executive travel (but not use of the office jet). 
Lucent Technologies, a struggling telecoms-equipment company, agreed to pay Richard McGinn, its former chairman and chief executive, a package worth $13m for barely three years' service. Deborah Hopkins, a former chief financial officer, will get near $5m.

Enron Goes Overboard
By PAUL KRUGMAN

08/17/2001
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Whom the gods would destroy, they first put on the cover of Business Week. When the Feb. 12 issue featured a cover photo of Jeffrey Skilling, you knew bad things were about to happen both to Enron and to its new C.E.O. Sure enough, on Tuesday Mr. Skilling resigned for ''personal reasons.'' The next day he conceded that the most important of those personal reasons was the 50 percent drop in Enron's stock since January. 
Is this just another tale of extravagant expectations disappointed, the kind of story that has become all too common lately? No; this case has wider significance. Enron, based in Houston, is in the vanguard of a powerful movement that hopes to ''financialize'' (Enron's term) just about everything -- that is, trade almost everything as if it were stock options.
That movement is as much about politics as it is about business, and the company has not been shy about using its political connections to advance its cause. With the arrival of George W. Bush in the White House -- thanks largely to Enron, a prime mover behind his campaign --the sky seemed to be the limit. 
But financialization looks more and more like a movement that has overreached itself. 
Enron was originally a natural gas pipeline company, swaddled like all such companies in a tight regulatory straitjacket. In the mid-1980's, however, gas markets were set free. And Kenneth Lay, who was C.E.O. at the time and is returning to succeed Mr. Skilling, saw a great opportunity. 
He transformed Enron from a company that delivered B.T.U.'s to one that dealt in contracts; as Business Week put it, the company became ''more akin to Goldman Sachs than to Consolidated Edison.'' Enron became the lead market-maker for the new, deregulated natural gas industry; since deregulation worked well for natural gas, which increasingly became the nation's fuel of choice, Enron's new role was highly profitable. 
After gas, electricity. As power deregulation became the rage across the U.S., Enron took on a key role as a broker for wholesale electricity. Soon the company was looking for new worlds to conquer: water supply, bandwidth on fiber-optic cables, data storage, even advertising space. 
Then things started to go wrong. Enron abandoned its venture into water supply when it became clear that governments were reluctant to entrust so crucial a matter to the magic of the invisible hand. And skeptics found ample justification for their lack of faith when electricity deregulation, which was supposed to be a certified success story, went spectacularly astray in California. 
True believers insist that the power crisis of 2000-2001, which transferred tens of billions of dollars from taxpayers to electricity-generating companies -- and quite a bit to Enron too -- was not a verdict on deregulation, that it was all the fault of meddling politicians who didn't let the market work. But this claim isn't particularly convincing, mainly because it isn't true. The real lesson of the California catastrophe was that the concerns that led to regulation in the first place -- monopoly power and the threat of market manipulation -- are still real issues today. 
State and local governments, alerted by what happened in California, will henceforth be a lot more wary about deregulation. There's even a movement to reregulate electricity markets. And that means fewer opportunities for Enron, whose stock price depends on the expectation that it will keep finding new Californias to conquer. 
Of course, the people Enron put in the White House are still there, and they seem to have learned nothing from California. It's true that the Bush administration sometimes compromises on its free-market principles -- it believes, for example, that energy producers need huge subsidies, even though the shortages those subsidies were supposed to correct have turned out to be imaginary (a recent cover story in Barron's warned of ''the coming energy glut''). 
But otherwise the administration's faith in absolutely unregulated markets is unshaken. The new head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- the watchdog agency that conspicuously refused to do its job in California -- is, you guessed it, a Texan with close ties to the energy industry. And the administration continues to believe that ''financialization'' is the way to go on just about everything, from school vouchers to Social Security. 
But it's wrong. And let's hope that it doesn't take a string of catastrophes to teach us that there are limits to what markets can do.

IN BRIEF / ENERGY Enron Chief Seeks to Reassure Employees

The chairman of Enron Corp. sought to reassure employees Thursday that the energy giant's business is on firm footing as its stock faced a second day of brutal pressure on Wall Street following a top executive's surprise resignation. 
Kenneth L. Lay told employees at a companywide meeting that Enron's business is strong, despite the extended pressure on its stock and heir apparent Jeffrey K. Skilling's unexpected resignation as chief executive and president.
""We've got a lot of great stuff going on and we're not getting much credit for it in the marketplace, but we will,"" Lay said. His comments came as Enron's stock saw its worst day in 19 months, closing down $3.40, or 8.5%, at $36.85 on the New York Stock Exchange. That brings its losses to about 13% since Skilling announced his resignation after the market's close Tuesday.

Five major Hollywood studios said Thursday they are joining forces to build an Internet service that will allow consumers to download full-length movies to watch on their home computers and televisions beginning as early as this year. 
The studios--Sony Pictures Entertainment, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Warner Bros.--believe that the pay service is the best way to combat the proliferation of bootleg feature films.
Their as-yet-unnamed venture marks a radically different strategy from the one adopted by music companies. Record labels watched helplessly as millions of computer users employed Napster and other song-swapping services to download pirated copies of songs for free. 
Many observers believe that the record labels could have put a serious dent in services like Napster by offering consumers a legitimate way to obtain music on the Net. That is the strategy the studios are now embracing. 
""We feel we needed to offer a legal, high-quality, user-friendly alternative to what is currently out there on the Internet today,"" said Kevin Tsujihara, executive vice president of new media and strategic planning at Warner Bros. ""By getting out in front of this, we were going to hopefully prevent some of the issues confronting the music industry."" 
Initially, the studios will make 100 of their movies available to those with a personal computer and a high-speed broadband Internet connection. Each feature-length film will take 20 to 40 minutes to download, depending on the speed of a customer's broadband connection, how far away the customer is from a network hub and how crowded the network is at the time. The movies will boast better picture quality than videotape but will be less sharp than DVDs. 
""It's not view on demand, but it's as easy as getting in a car and driving to the local video store,"" said Yair Landau, president of Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment. 
Each studio will control when its movies become available for downloading, which titles will be on the service and how much each movie will cost. Sony, for example, plans to price its movies between $4 and $5 and offer them at the same time that they can be ordered through cable television pay-per-view services. Each studio will own 20% of the venture. 
The new service will use technology developed largely by Sony to enable customers to download movies over digital subscriber lines and cable modems. The technology incorporates special digital rights management software designed to combat the rampant piracy that has plagued the music industry. 
There are a few cable and Internet-based video-on-demand services in operation, but they lack a steady supply of current movies and television shows, and they have not attracted large audiences. 
Conspicuously absent from the venture are Twentieth Century Fox and Walt Disney Co., which are developing a rival system called Movies.com. Disney officials would not comment on why the company did not join the five studios. The Burbank-based entertainment giant is expected to announce a separate video-on-demand venture in the coming weeks. 
Initially, consumers will have to use their PCs to tap into the service. Some of the studios involved in the venture insist there is a segment of the movie-watching public--most notably college students--that will stare at a computer monitor for their entertainment. But analysts said the appeal of PC movies was limited. 
""I don't see a lot of people watching movies on their PCs unless they're on an airplane,"" said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif. 
Consumers can watch their downloaded movies on television by connecting their PCs and TVs with a simple S-video cable or a radio frequency device connection, which is standard on many computers. 
Ultimately, couch potatoes will be able to download the movies directly to their digital cable set-top boxes and watch them on television without the need for special hookups. In fact, the movies will be able to drop directly into any digital device connected to the Internet, including many types of Net appliances that are still being developed, Landau said. 
It was the realization that today's technology could be extended to set-top boxes and satellite delivery systems that spurred the negotiations between the studios, Landau said. That broadened the nature of the talks into a forum for creating an industrywide standard for providing digital video on demand. 
Anticipating federal regulatory concerns, the studios contacted the Justice Department ""as a matter of courtesy,"" said a studio spokesman, noting that other entertainment companies can join the venture. In addition, each of the studios is free to pursue other video-on-demand opportunities. 
Having a single standard will speed customer acceptance of digital movie distribution, said David Bishop, president of MGM Home Entertainment Group in Santa Monica. 
""If MGM opened its own video store and Paramount opened its own video store, it would be very difficult for the consumer to shop,"" he said. ""Here they're able to go to one Web site and find a critical mass of content that is much more compelling than any one studio launching."" 
Standards also will ease the work of broadband providers such as EarthLink Network, an Atlanta-based Internet service provider that discussed the venture with the studios. 
""This will certainly make it easier for a company like us to come in and hopefully negotiate with one entity as opposed to having [to maintain] a different set of technology requirements for each studio,"" EarthLink President Mike McQuary said. 
The new service could cannibalize video rentals and sales at chains such as Blockbuster Video, which account for almost half of movie-company revenues. Although the exact timing varies from studio to studio, videos and DVDs generally are available for sale and rental six months after the theatrical release of a movie. Those movies are available to pay-per-view services two months later. 
Earlier this year, Blockbuster dismantled a video-on-demand service it was testing with energy giant Enron Corp.

Abreast of the Market
Ciena, Brocade and Sonus Decline On Profit Woes, but Others Hang In
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

08/17/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Another brace of discouraging profit statements from technology-gear makers threatened to sink stocks again, but fears subsided as investors realized they had heard that tune before, letting market averages rally by the close. 
The impact on individual issues proved harrowing enough. Telecommunications-equipment maker Ciena hurtled to a 52-week low, declining $8.50, or 30%, to $19.62 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. A total of 94 million Ciena shares changed hands, compared with a daily average of about 18 million shares.
The declines came after the optical-systems concern warned that its earnings for the final quarter of its fiscal year, as well as for fiscal 2002, wouldn't be nearly as robust as analysts have been thinking. 
A number of other optical-systems makers joined Ciena in the downturn. ONI Systems shed 1.56, or 8.4%, to 17.02, Sonus Networks fell 2.16, or 13%, to 14.95, and Juniper Networks retreated 2.05, or 9.3%, to 20.02, all in Nasdaq trading. 
Compounding the misery in high technology, data-storage software maker Brocade Communications served up a downbeat outlook to accompany its quarterly results, which came out late Wednesday. Brocade slumped 2.38, or 7.8%, to 27.96 on Nasdaq. Other storage names, such as McData Class B declined 2.71, or 17%, to 12.91 on Nasdaq, hitting a 52-week low. 
Unlike previous sessions, when discouraging profit chatter proved the undoing of the technology sector, the latest warnings weren't fatal. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished the day ahead 11.43 points, or 0.6%, at 1930.32. 
""You might have expected today's casualties, Ciena and Brocade, to drag down the whole market,"" Jefferies Chief Market Analyst Arthur Hogan said. ""But I think investors realized they weren't that surprised to hear of weakness in the technology sector, and the economic data we saw weren't as bad as they were expecting."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.57 points, or 0.45%, to 10392.52. 
Housing-starts data that were stronger than economists anticipated spurred gains for home builders. Pulte Homes rose 1.04, to 36.15. Centex gained 1.22, to 42.85. Lennar added 2.15, or 5.6%, to 40.66. 
Restaurant stocks moved higher amid continuing hope that consumer spending ignores the weakness that has beset the manufacturing economy. McDonald's gained 1.21, to 29.70. Krispy Kreme Doughnuts rose 2.22, or 7.7%, to 31.19. Outback Steakhouse gained 77 cents, to 28.95. 
Manufacturers gained after the release of a look at regional-manufacturing activity. United Technologies rose 2.76, to 73.60. Northrop Grumman gained 1.44, to 79.99. General Dynamics rose 1.39, to 83.24. The gains came after a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed that manufacturing activity in its region declined more dramatically than expected in August, but also said expectations for a recovery remain very strong. 
SmartForce (Nasdaq) fell 1.80, to 35.20. A technology trade journal reported the Redwood City, Calif., online-learning concern lost a contract to provide electronic-learning services to McDonald's to a rival, closely held Knowledgenet.com. 
Maximus fell 1.38, to 45.36, even though Dain Rauscher Wessels made upbeat comments about the outlook for the McLean, Va., provider of consulting services to government agencies. 
Sprint gained 48 cents, to 23.23, helped by encouraging comments from Thomas Weisel Partners about the provider of local-phone service. 
Instinet rose 72 cents, or 6.3%, to 12.07, despite pessimistic comments from Merrill Lynch, which cut earnings projections for the New York electronic-brokerage concern. The stock has traded at a 52-week low during the past week. 
Comverse Technology (Nasdaq) gained 2.76, or 10%, to 29.51. Goldman Sachs boosted its rating on the Woodbury, N.Y., telecommunications-systems company. 
Crown Castle fell 55 cents, or 6.3%, to 8.20. The Houston antenna-space leasing concern named John P. Kelly, its president and chief operating officer, chief executive, succeeding Ted B. Miller, who remains chairman. 
Agilent Technologies eased 35 cents, to 27.50. Goldman Sachs, in a preview of the Palo Alto, Calif., semiconductor concern's earnings release due Monday, said it expected the company to reduce its forecast for the fiscal fourth quarter. 
SouthTrust gained 53 cents to 26.38. Keefe Bruyette & Woods added the Birmingham, Ala., bank to its KBW/Philadelphia Stock Exchange Bank Index. 
Hormel dropped 1.18, to 24.87. The Austin, Minn., food producer posted fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' projections. 
Ryder System gained 1.20, or 6%, to 21.10. Morgan Stanley boosted its rating on the Miami transportation company, citing the success of management's cost-cutting initiatives. 
Enron, which fell to a 52-week low Wednesday as investors reacted to the announcement the Houston gas-pipeline operator and energy trader's chief executive unexpectedly resigned, declined again, falling 3.40, or 8.4%, to 36.85. 
Estee Lauder gained 1.09, to 39.85. The New York beauty-products maker posted fiscal fourth-quarter results that lived up to Wall Street's projections. 
Charles Schwab fell 50 cents, to 12.87, sinking to a 52-week low. The San Francisco discount-brokerage house has explored the possibility of purchasing the securities concern Jefferies Group, according to yesterday's Wall Street Journal. Jefferies gained 62 cents, to 36.65, reaching a 52-week high. 
Several multinational consumer-products companies made progress during the session, as investors responded to recent weakness in the value of the U.S. currency. Procter & Gamble gained 2.01, to 74.19. Colgate-Palmolive rose 98 cents, to 55.36. Kimberly-Clark gained 1.17, to 62.11. 
On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,689 issues advancing and 1,389 declining. 
NYSE volume totaled 1,060,367,770 shares, compared with 1,061,487,720 Wednesday. The average price per share rose two cents.

India To Begin Conciliation Talks With Enron Unit Sat

08/17/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's government will begin Saturday the first round of conciliation talks with U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian subsidiary Dabhol Power Co., the Press Trust of India news agency reported Friday. 
The talks are aimed at resolving all outstanding issues between the government and DPC which resulted in the stoppage of power generation May 29 at the $2.9 billion 740 megawatt Dabhol project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, PTI said.
As reported, DPC gave a conciliation and an arbitration notice to the federal government April 4 for not honoring counter-guarantees over non-payment of electricity bills by Maharashtra State Electricity Board for December 2000 and January. 
India has appointed retired Supreme Court Judge B.P. Jeevan Reddy as its conciliator, while DPC has appointed former Chief Justice of New South Wales Lawrence Street as its representative on the three-member panel. Former New Zealand High Court Judge David A.R. Williams is the third conciliator, jointly chosen by both parties. 
Dabhol is India's single largest foreign investment to date.

As a parting gift for Diane we thought (actually
Lesley Keffer thought, and I always obey her more
sensible commands) that we should take a group photo
at Thursday night's party, enlarge to a decent size,
frame and present to Diane for hanging on her new
office wall so she will be forced to remember us
forever more. 

Therefore, I have engaged a photographer to be show up
in the Wells Fargo Room on Thursday at about 8.  I
expect there will be quite a few of us, so we will
arrange some chairs and stuff for tier seating, etc.
and hope for the best.  Bring your cheesiest grins.

See you there.

p.s.  Diane, if you read this, you just ruined your
surprise.  In order not to make the situation worse,
don't let on that you know anything about this so we
can all continue in our ignorant bliss.

1013,"Hi Everyone,

I thought it would be helpful to you, in filling out the faculty
evaluations, if  I explained a bit further how the administration views the
quantitative rankings you give to instructors.  Specifically, there are two
questions at the end of the evaluation form that ask you about the teaching
effectiveness of the instructor and whether you would recommend the
instructor to a friend.  You are asked to answer these two questions on a
scale from 1 - 7, with 1 being ""Not at all effective"" and 7 being
""Extremely effective.""

As viewed by the administration, a median score of 5 or above is considered
acceptable.  While we would love to have everyone earning a 6, this is
quite difficult to accomplish!  Scores below 5 are taken very seriously.

In the case of a visitor earning below a 5.0, he or she is given one more
semester to improve
their teaching.  If in the next semester the instructor does not improve
(earn a 5.0 or above), it is unlikely he or she will be rehired.

In the case of a regular faculty member earning below a 5.0, the
administration works with him
or her on a plan to improve his or her teaching.  In some cases, the
instructor may
not be allowed to teach the course again.

Please be sure to utilize the full range of the evaluation scale so that we
can continue to reward those  faculty members who are doing a great job and
work with those who need improvement.

Cheers,

Diane

I think Mike's suggestion that some of the details have another look should
focus towards the Interim Settlement, or more specifically the PD
provisions, as opposed to anything in the CS.  Even though we can all
express our support of the CS, it is not being voted on, and there is no
alternate decision that would even allow that for now.  But as Mike
suggests, maybe the Commission can be persuaded that the status quo needs to

State's Electric Bill Gets Lighter


Energy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO
Times Staff Writer

October 20 2001

SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. 

Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. 

The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. 

Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. 

Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts. 

California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. 

In August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. 

But in what consumer groups angrily called a ""jailbreak,"" Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs. 

Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers

The PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. 

However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers. 

""Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers,"" said Pete Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. ""Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers."" 

State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the ""stampede"" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. 

""What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis,"" Angelides said. 

And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. 

""The PUC first gave Edison their bailout,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. ""Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place."" 

But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. 

Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. 

The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. 

""If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve,"" Lynch said. ""The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts."" 

Also adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates. 

The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. 

Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on Strategy

In a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. 

If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. 

In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. 

But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. 

""I don't think it's real smart to tell you that,"" said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.",Davis MIGUEL BUSTILLO Gray Davis Loretta Lynch Lynch Pete Garris Phil Angelides Doug Heller Angelides Stay Tight-Lipped S.

A few thoughts:
Conference calls on issues of this size don't generally seem very constructive, and I'd suggest that we push for a face-to-face with Edison.
If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, Edison won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule.
No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense.  It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.  That said, no shots, no ducks.  We ought to make a push.
The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC.
Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer).
The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much ""headroom"" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements.
Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective.
All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate (""ORA"") buy into the idea.
I'd propose that we continue with Edison. If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA.
On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.

Some preliminary thoughts.  Happy to discuss further.

Jeff

The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. 
The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). 
The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. 
The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

> Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked
> beans.  He loved them, but they always had  an embarrassing and somewhat
> lively reaction on him.
>
> One day he met a girl and fell in love.  When it became apparent that they
> would marry, he thought to himself, she'll never go through with the
> marriage with me carrying on like this, so he made the supreme sacrifice
> and
> gave up beans.
>
> Shortly after that they were married.
>
> A few months later, on the way home from work, his car broke down and
since
> they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her that he would
be
> late because he had to walk.  On his way home, he passed a small cafe and
> the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him.
>
> Since he still had several miles to walk, he figured he could walk off any
> ill effects before he got home.  So he went in and ordered, and before
> leaving he had 3 extra large helpings of baked beans.  All the way home he
> putt-putted.  By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe.
>
> His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited.  She exclaimed,
> ""Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!""
.
> She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the
> table and made him promise not to peak.
>
> At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on.  Just as his
> wife was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang.  She again
made
> him promise not to peek until she returned, and away she went to answer
the
> phone.  While she was gone, he seized the opportunity.  He shifter his
> weight to one leg and let it go.  It was not only loud, but ripe as a
> rotten
> egg.  He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned
> the
> air about him.
>
> He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on.  He raised
> his leg and RRIIIPPPP! It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and
smelled
> worse.  To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms awhile, hoping the
> smell would dissipate.  He got another urge, this was the real blue-ribbon
> winner, the windows shook, the dishes on the table rattled and a minute
> later the flowers on the table were dead.
>
> While keeping an ear turned in on the conversation in the hallway, and
> keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for
the
> next ten minutes, farting and fanning each time with his napkin.  When he
> heard the phone farewells, he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded
> his hands on top of it.  Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of
> innocence when his wife walked in.
>
> Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner
> table,  After assuring her he had not peeked, she removed the blindfold
and
> yelled, "" SURPRISE!!"".

1160,"I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Over 70% of European companies
face weather-related risk

Today's business has become all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather derivatives have become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging as utilities, airlines, agriculture have at hand to offset risks associated with temperature and precipitation.

So how do you take advantage of this new market in weather trading that has emerged in Europe? What key issues do you have to be aware of to mitigate your operational and trading risks through weather? Amsterdam will be the place for traders, marketers, exchanges, brokers, and executives powering the weather trading industry to network with each other.

1212,"We have a great deal of work underway with our continuing operations, bankruptcy related issues, managing asset sales transitions and major operating environment issues.  While I have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges, we will need to simultaneously direct our attention on a number of key areas to be successful.

In light of the above, I have asked Danny McCarty to take on a new role as managing director of special projects for Enron Global Services (EGS).  Danny's responsibilities will include a number of complex bankruptcy related activities, the workout of certain troubled assets and optimizing the value of selected businesses.

Until the question of our right to repurchase Northern Natural Gas is resolved, it is better to minimize organizational changes.  Consequently, I do not plan to replace Danny as managing director and chief commercial officer of Enron Transportation Services (ETS) at this time.  Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Rob Kilmer, Shelley Corman and the business development efforts will report directly to me.

I truly appreciate Danny's willingness to take on this responsibility.  His involvement should ensure that we dedicate the necessary attention to key business issues, while allowing Jim Hughes and me to focus on the priorities of a reorganization plan and our day-to-day operations.

As always, thank you for your continued dedication and support.

1241,"Gov. Davis announced today his appointment of Mike Peevey as Commissioner at the CPUC to replace Com. Bilas who resigned last week.  Mr. Peevey is the former President of Southern California Edison and as such advocated deregulation.  Consumer group advocates are concerned about his past record and oppose his nomination which is subject to state Senate approval.  Below is an article from the Sacramento Bee.  gh


Davis names ex-Edison chief to PUC
But the action stirs anger: 'Our worst nightmare,' says a consumer lawyer.
By Stuart Leavenworth -- Bee Staff Writer
Published 5:30 a.m. PST Wednesday, March 6, 2002
Gov. Gray Davis has appointed a former president of Southern California Edison to a state panel charged with regulating Edison and other public utilities.
Davis said Michael R. Peevey would bring ""more than three decades of experience"" to the Public Utilities Commission -- experience that immediately came under fire from the state's consumer groups.
Mike Florio, a lawyer for The Utility Reform Network, said Peevey has a record, both in government and in business, of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers.
""This is a our worst nightmare,"" Florio said. ""It is like putting Dr. Kevorkian in charge of a nursing home.""
Others were more supportive. D.J. Smith, a lobbyist who represents large industrial energy users, lauded Peevey as someone ""who understands all sides of the energy business"" and will be fair to all sides.
""I think he will be objective about Edison because he doesn't owe Edison anything,"" said Smith, noting that Peevey left the Southern California utility nine years ago.
The husband of Assemblywoman Carol Liu, D-South Pasadena, Peevey replaces PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, who resigned last week. Bilas was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson.
If confirmed by the state Senate, Peevey will solidify Davis' control over the PUC, a five-member board that now includes three of the governor's appointees. It also comes at a time when the commission is fighting with the state's other large utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., on terms for PG&E's reorganization in federal bankruptcy court.
PG&E spokesman Ron Low declined to comment on the appointment Tuesday, but last year Peevey was involved with a handshake deal that might have helped PG&E avoid bankruptcy.
Hired by Davis to negotiate with the utility, Peevey reportedly struck a deal with PG&E Chairman Bob Glynn that would have let PG&E charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity. But other Davis advisers objected to the deal and the negotiations ultimately fell apart.
For three years, Peevey was president of Edison International and Southern California Edison before leaving in 1993 in a reported power struggle with company Chairman John Bryson.
Peevey then became a public affairs consultant and then president of NewEnergy Inc., an energy service provider that was sold in 1999 to AES Corp. After working as an adviser to Davis, he had been CEO of TruePricing Inc. and also has served on the board of Excelergy Corp., an energy software company.
With his new six-year PUC job, Peevey will regulate not only electric utilities but telecommunications giants, water companies, natural gas supplies and other industries.
After a review by PUC lawyers, Peevey will have to divest holdings and resign from positions that could cause a conflict, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.
Peevy's appointment was one of two Davis made Tuesday. He also appointed John L. Geesman to the board of the Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state power grid.
Since 1985, Geesman has been the managing director of fixed income banking for RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. in San Francisco. He once served on TURN's board.
Consumer groups, which had pressed for a meeting with Davis for the past week, said the he may have timed his Election Day appointment of Peevey to minimize negative media coverage.
Maviglio called that claim ""ludicrous."" Today's papers, he said, ""will be some of the best read this year.""

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/29/01
Johnson suffered a slight ankle injury during Monday night's win over St. Louis. However, he is expected to start in Sunday against Cincinnati, so don't be afraid to play him this week. 

Terrell Owens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1290&>, WR SF - Martin Updated 11/29/01
According to the Contra Costa Times, Owens (ankle/foot) could miss Sunday's game against Buffalo. He missed pratice on Wednesday and could miss practice on Thursday as well. ""We've got ! si! x games left and I know what's at stake for this team"", said Owens. I've got to be smart about it (the injury)."" He is currently listed as questionable for Week 12, which could make him a risky start for Fantasy owners. 

Saints <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=18&>, DT NO - JWillie Updated 11/29/01
Cornerback Kevin Mathis missed practice on Wednesday due to a neck injury. ""I've been trying to play through it, but I think it has caught up with me,"" Mathis told the Times-Picayune. ""I start out the game fine, but after about the second tackle, the pain comes back immediately."" Mathis is questionable for Sunday's game against Carolina, which could be good news for Fantasy owners with Panther receivers on their roster. 

Cameron Cleeland <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12277&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Cleeland, who has been nursing a high ankle sprain for several weeks, returned to practice on Wednesday. ""He looked good out there running and catching the ball, but we'll see,"" coach Jim Haslett told the Times-Picayune. Cleeland has been upgraded from doubtful to questionable for Week 12, but he's still too risky to start on your Fantasy team unless you're extremely desperate. 

Jackie Harris <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Harris, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, practiced on W! ed! nesday. The team expects him to play on Sunday against Washington, but he's not reliable enough for Fantasy owners to consider starting in Week 12. 

Kris Mangum <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1672&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Mangum suffered a neck stinger during practice on Wednesday. His status for Sunday's game against New Orleans is uncertain. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/29/01
According to the Charlotte Observer , Muhammad is expected to miss this weekend's game against New Orleans due to a shoulder injury. Isaac Byrd will make his second consecutive start in Muhammad's absence. 

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 11/29/01
Smith is dealing with both neck and ankle injuries, but he was able to practice on Wednesday. He has been losing carries to Bob Christian in recent weeks, however, and playing against a tough Rams' defense doesn't bode well for his chances for Fantasy success. 

Falcons <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=2&>, DT ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Cornerback Ray Bu! ch! anan missed practice on Wednesday due to flu-like symptoms. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against St. Louis, but his absence won't make Atlanta's defense any less attractive against the Rams' top-notch offense. 

Thomas Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=187390&>, RB ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/29/01
Jones is dealing with an upper-respitory infection that caused him to miss practice on Wednesday. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game at Oakland, but he won't see enough carries to warrant a start on your Fantasy team.

Frank Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Sanders missed practice on Wednesday due to soreness in both of his hamstrings. He is currently listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Oakland, so be sure to monitor his status if you need to start him in Week 12. 

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Smith told the Denver Post he expects to play Sunday at Miami, but he won't be able to attempt to practice until at least Friday. Even if he does play, he won't be at full strength, and he may be limited.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/29/01
Davis said his! k! nee felt good in practice on Wednesday, and he will start on Sunday at Miami, says the Denver Post. Still, it is not clear how much he will play, and Davis will probably share carries with Mike Anderson.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 11/29/01
Jones did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game as he continues to battle a nagging ankle injury.

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Graham missed Wednesday's practice with a thigh bruise, and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game. Trevor Gaylor may have to start against the Seahawks if Graham cannot play.

Steve Christie <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1378&>, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Christie was signed by the Chargers, and will replace Wade Richey as the team's placekicker. Richey will continue to work on kickoffs. Christie appears to be recovered from a groin injury that led to his release in Buffalo earlier this year. See how he performs in his first game or two before considering him for Fantasy purposes. 

Roland Williams <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12829&>, TE OAK - Free Agent ! Updated 11/29/01
Williams has missed practice time with an ankle injury, and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game with Arizona. Mondriel Fulcher will probably start in his place if Williams cannot play.

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Wayne (knee) is expected to return this week. Don't expect him to do much in the return from his latest injury. A rookie receiver who has not played regularly is always a Fantasy risk.

Lamar Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 11/29/01
Smith is listed as probable for Sunday's game with a shoulder injury. The Miami RB hasn't played well recently, and he isn't the must-start player he was in 2000.

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/29/01
Culpepper was scheduled to undergo an MRI Wednesday night as a result of continued stiffness in his left knee. He sat out most drills during Wednesday's practice, but is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The Vikings believe Culpepper may have sprained ligaments in the knee, and the severity should be known sometime Thursday. Hold off on making a decision on starting him for now.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=! 70! 5&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Gadsden is listed as probable for Sunday's game with a shoulder injury. The Miami receiver hasn't been consistently productive this year, and he is a risky start even when his health is not an issue.

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 11/29/01
Favre practiced Wednesday and reported improvement in the sore back that had hampered him after Week 11. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Jacksonville, and you shouldn't be afraid to start him in your Fantasy league this week.

Tyrone Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=! 14! 99&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
There is a possibility Davis, who has missed the first 10 games of the season with a hamstring injury, could be activated in time for Monday's game against Jacksonville. He probably wouldn't be one of the top two tight ends, however, and we're skeptical that he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season.

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 11/29/01
Glenn (hamstring) is now listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Jets, but may be soon downgraded to questionable and may be placed on injured reserve, says the Boston Globe. He worked out with players who were unable to practice on Wednesday, but did ! no! t work out in pads with the full squad.

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/29/01
Batch practiced Wednesday and showed no ill effects of the pulled groin that forced him out of last Thursday's game against Green Bay. He is expected to start Sunday against Chicago, but is only worth using in Fantasy leagues if you have no other reliable QB on your roster.

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Stewart's ankle, which kept him out of four straight games prior to last Sunday, is still a source of constant pain, according ! to! the Detroit Free Press. ""My ankle's still sore,"" he said. ""It's something that's going to bother me, and I don't think it's going to stop bothering me until the season's over. Hopefully, I can just get through the season without further injuring it, and continue to play on it."" Stewart remains a good play in Fantasy leagues only based on the matchup - this week's game against the Bears is unfavorable, so only use him if you're lacking in options at running back.

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 11/29/01
Thomas ran lightly in practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit due to a pulled right hamstring. He hopes to practice Thursday, and a decision on his status for the game might come later in the week, possibl! y ! Saturday. If Thomas can't go, expect James Allen to get the start. Hold off on starting either back until it's clear who will be getting the bulk of the carries against the weak Lions rush defense.

Tony Gonzalez <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 11/29/01
Gonzalez should post good numbers against the Eagles. Philadelphia strong safety Damon Moore may have trouble handling the big, athletic tight end. At 5-11, 215 pounds, he becomes the one obvious mismatch for the Chiefs to exploit in the passing game.

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 11/29/01
Green, who has been a Fantasy disappointment this year, may be in for a rough night against the Eagles. Philadelphia will blitz him often, and their cornerbacks will easily handle the mediocre Chiefs receivers. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 11/29/01
Don't expect much from Pinkston, even against the erratic Chiefs defense. The Philadelphia wideout has not responded well to increased defensive attention after he played well early in the year.

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1028&>, Active QB Updated 11/29/01
Favre practiced Wednesday and reported improvement in the sore back that had hampered him after Week 11. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Jacksonville, and you shouldn't be afraid to start him in your Fantasy league this week.

Maurice Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=188183&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/29/01
Smith is dealing with both neck and ankle injuries, but he was able to practice on Wednesday. He has been losing carries to Bob Christian in recent weeks, however, and playing against a tough Rams' defense doesn't bode well for his chances for Fantasy success. 

Olandis Gary <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=133291&>, Reserve RB Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1003&>, Reserve QB Updated 11/25/01
Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. 

Garrison Hearst <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1164&>, Active RB Updated 11/25/01
Hearst had 106 yards rushing and two touchdowns against Indianapolis on Sunday. Hearst has had three consecutive solid weeks, and is proving his worth as a Fantasy player. 

James Thrash <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1859&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/25/01
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1236&>, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1294&>, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. 

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1593&>, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1681&>, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678 rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1189&>, Reserve WR Updated 11/19/01
Mathis had by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. If you play in a deeper league, you may want to consider starting Mathis against the Panthers' weak pass defense. 

Titans <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=29&>, Active DT Updated 11/06/01
Linebacker Randall Godfrey suffered torn cartilage in his left knee during Sunday's win over Jacksonville. He'll undergo arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday and will be listed as questionable for Monday's game against Baltimore. 

Dorsey Levens <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1107&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/12/01
Levens (back) is probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He's got no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. 

David Akers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=705&key=1666&>, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Thanks!
Ina",Mike,12,
1263,"Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=

1283,"Great!  We've got a meeting set for 9 am on Wed on the regulatory structure 
of the pipeline.  Also, I talked to Kevin and Tim separately today on the 
market research issue.  I think Tim could probably identify the specific 
electric rate PNM charges DOE at Sandia and DOD at Kirtland as well as the 
general tariff rate for large industrial service.  If we are lucky, there 
might be some info in PNM's last rate case on the discounted electric rates 
it gives specific large industrials (if any).  Obviously, any info on gas or 
elec. loads and rates would be useful.  Kevin, I told Tim you'd give him a 
call to convey further thoughts, but this is probably enough to get Tim 
started.

I got a call this afternoon from Tino.  He asked our help on right of way 
issues with BNSF.  Could Steve, Kevin or Lorraine take point on trying to 
find out if we or anyone within Enron has a good contact at BNSF that we 
could use?  Lets keep all such external contacts very discreet to avoid 
tipping PNM that Enron is involved.  Just in general on the confidentiality 
issue, Tim reminded me of an important date we all need to keep in mind--the 
current leglislative session in Santa Fe ends Feb. 17.  We need to be 
absolutely sure that we don't tip PNM off that we are talking to Langley 
before then so we don't get them interested in the leglislative fix we are 
supporting on the Plains-Tri State merger.  Tim believes PNM could spike that 
leglislative fix in a heartbeat if they wanted to.  That issue is real 
immediate dollars, so lets not let a future deal screw up a present deal 
(even a lawyer like me can figure out the cost benefit on that situation).

Tino had a new fact to work into the economics:  DOE has 6000MMBtu/d of pure 
gas load at Sandia in addition to elec. load.  No number yet on Kirtland gas 
load.  Also, Tino has heard that a guy named Jeff Sturba will likely replace 
Montoya at PNM before the end of the year.  Has anyone else heard that?  Do  
we know him?     

I told Tino that one of us would give him a call back by the end of the week 
just to report in on our analysis.  At minimum, we can probably pass on the 
name of a contact at Enron Wind for Tino to bother on the windmill thing.  
Turned out that the wind pilot project is on the Rosebud reservation in S.D. 
and has nothing to do with the Albuquerque project anyway.  Sorry about the 
random message but thats how my brain is working today.  DF

concept.  When we left this (unless there have been subsequent conversations 
with ECS that I wasn't a part of) we rejected Courtney's proposal to reduce 
our up front payment by $500,000.  He was to come back and propose a monthly 
quantity of gas to be paid over the term of the contract that would equate to 
the $500,000, but I don't recall that we agreed to it.  Did we intend to 
leave the issue open for more horsetrading on the amount of a haircut ECS

wrong.  Second, sorry this is late.  Friday was 1st day, our longest of the 
month.

   DRAFT

This is a summary of where we stand from a Risk Management perspective on the 
PGT/Socal permanent assignment to Calpine  Currently there are 5 deals in 
Tagg and 1 in the transport  model.

 EC3952.O - Annuity where the West desk pays PGT (from $.08987 to $.17308) on 
67,500/Day thru Oct-23
 This deal will be unwound and this income (approx $30M) will fall out in the 
West desk

 EC3952.F - Buy from Canada of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + 
$.00
 EC3952.K - Sell to AEC of 30,000/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index + $.00
 As of now, these deals will remain unchanged in the system because AEC will 
not let us out of the firm contract

 EC2208.B - Buy from Canada of 22,500/Day thru Oct-08 at Malin for Index - 
$.005
 EC3952.B - Buy from Canada of 15,000/Day thru Oct-01 at Malin for Index - 
$.01
 These deals will be unwound, but discussions between Philip Allen and ??? 
will reveal details not known at this point in time   (Bid/Offer)

 Transport Model - Kingsgate to Malin capacity of 67,500/Day beginning Nov-08 
thru Oct-23
 This deal will have to be unwound or killed - Currently the deal is valued 
at approx $12M in the West Desk

After unwinding these deals, the West desk will be kept whole, the remainder 
will be granted out in orig.

This is my first go at it.  Let me know of any revisions you want.

1324,"I think it will be a very close game.  Except for the fart against Colorado,  
you just don't bet against the Aggies at Kyle Field.  OU is obviously a very 
good team.  But I think more importantly, they are just playing great 
football.  They make plays when they need them, and I know it sounds like 
sour grapes, but frankly, they are also getting lucky.  When the QB heaves a 
pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a TD week after week, 
the football Gods are smiling on you big time.  But regardless, you've got to 
admire Stoops and the job he has done.  They have proven for three 
consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best 
defenses in the country.  

And as far as the Horns are concerned, I still think they are just an above 
average team.  They have beaten no one of any (and I mean any) significance.  
They were completely outclassed against the one (albeit right now, the best 
team in the country) good team they have played.  And lost to a bad Stanford 
team.  But the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may 
result in a T+1 win.  But right now, I think the Aggies have a better team.  
But if they start thinking about aTM, they will lose to both Tech and KU.

FYI:
Barry had an abnormal stress test result  and was referred to a cardiologist.   He called me tonite to let me  know that the new   scan came out normal. Although he is very  careful about his food, his triglcs and chlosterol are  still  high...those Mayers genes again. 
 
Sara also had an appt with a cardiologist  today.  She has been having arryrhyimia ( sp?)...abornal heart beat.   She is now wearing a heart monitor for the next month, having blood work done,  etc.  Sounds like perhaps  a valve problem.  Serious enough for  sure, but sounds like she is in good hands and this is not something that would  cause a heart attack ( dr's words) .  I have not had time to look it up on  the net nor call Jessie, but plan to do both.  Will keep you posted.   Needless to say, she is pretty scared at the moment.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which Enron entity 
should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties.  
There are a couple of general rules that apply to ""normal"" trading 
circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not 
hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances 
vary (even just a little bit) from ""normal.""  For example, abnormal 
situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another 
transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment), 
the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain 
Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron 
company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we 
are trading (except as spelled out below).  Having said all that, the 
following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines:

1. If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an 
Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron 
company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is 
concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty, 
Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement.  Of 
course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading, 
Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where 
derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or 
can't be done by us from the U.S.).

2. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or 
Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should 
be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to 
the master agreement.  If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other 
rules may apply.  

3. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT 
International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is 
in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on 
behalf of ECT International.  Note that there are special considerations if 
the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is 
actually ""arranged"" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT 
International).  If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or 
U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two 
countries for final negotiation and execution.  It would be a good idea to 
consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice.  

These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal 
counterparty to the transactions.  This doesn't determine where within the 
Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside.  If we want the risk 
to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual 
purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT) 
to get the risk in the right place.",Lucy Tana,,Enron ENA ECT International Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. RMT
1421,"I asked  Richard Ramirez if there was a business contact and he said he 
didn't know, but he was going to get back to me.   I think in his job in Fuel 
and Energy Risk Management, he is probably the business contact.  He probably 
makes the decisions about fuel purchases and derivatives hedging.  He also 
wanted to get a power enabling agreement in place.  I spoke to Liz Sager and 
she said we already had a power trade on the books and except for authority 
issues, there was no reason not to do financial energy.

As far as sending my Lotus Notes comment, I just did that manually.  I spoke 
to the Lotus Notes people before I went on vacation, and among other changes, 
they are going to try and fix it so we can just click on the email address 
and it will notify people to see Lotus Notes.  Of course, the only groups 
that will have access to the comment sections of Lotus Notes (for 
confidentiality purposes) will continue to be Legal and Credit.

But we are going to open everything but the comments and ""priority"" screens 
to any interested business people.  I'm going to move the ""restrictions"" bar 
right after the name so when the business people look the first thing they 
will see will be any restrictions.

Then, I'm going to add a drop down for online trading, approved or not, and 
then a comment screen (that only Legal and Credit can see) so we will have 
some notes about why we approved them or not (some of us are getting old and 
can't remember things!).",Richard Ramirez Liz Sager,,"Fuel

questions.  First, about the approved products, as best as I can determine, 
we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep 
in.  Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper, I won't worry 
about that.  However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is 
always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master 
would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.  Unless you know of a reason 
to the contrary, I would think we want to open them for weather.

Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to 
mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular 
out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of 
Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it 
Core Procurement Department and California Gas Transmission Department.  Will 
they be financially trading separately under those departments?  And if so 
should we instruct the Settlements group to net the payments?

Steve Kean and I finally got to discuss this the other day and we decided 
that this effort would likely be too time consuming and costly, particularly

Title: California on the Brink 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas 

CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK 
The California Stalemate 
California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over 
credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would 
avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have 
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the 
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current 
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address 
the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be 
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.

Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this 
summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California 
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, 
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and 
significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied 
the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end 
their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance 
the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable 
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market. 

The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the 
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to 
address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is 
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective 
solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail 
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain 
muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is 
possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail 
to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will 
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws. 

In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western 
markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem. 
Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market 
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and 
demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for 
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed, 
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by 
discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated 
changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a 
challenging siting and permitting process.

Medicine Worse than the Illness 
Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were 
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay 
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus 
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of 
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of 
California's electric market woes.* 

* Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better 
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power 
plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone 
has struck down some key proposed facilities.

* Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices 
limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially 
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment 
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. 

* Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including 
the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new 
plant development.

* Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the 
FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the 
California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of 
gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits 
are a threat to new plant development.

* Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials 
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of 
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.

CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West 
are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability 
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of 
older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. 
California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of 
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers 
considering entering the state. 

Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in 
the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that 
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. 
In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a 
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the 
earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of 
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk 
of an outage. 

The Road to Recovery 
There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity 
shortfall: 

* Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a 
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal 
some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these 
actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not 
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.? 

* Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will 
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the 
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new 
build.

* Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the 
pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence 
(and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in 
the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With 
the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move 
toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a 
series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If 
they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect 
of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient 
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments.

* Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although 
originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are 
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing 
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a 
demand response.

* Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the ""Boom Bust"" characteristic of 
the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, 
or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to 
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the 
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to 
elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate) 
future price volatility.

* Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to 
be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable 
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term 
contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the 
market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since 
July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to 
do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its 
course. 

* Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a 
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply 
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to 
emissions restrictions. 

* Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA 
power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from 
operating to generate only power.

The stimulus package is expected to be on the House floor later next week.  This is a positive development because it puts us in the very best negotiating position as the focus moves to the Senate where there is less unanimity on repealing the corporate AMT.

Supporting the position of S. 1323, Robert Hewett representing TVA Watch, a=

Medford said S. 1323 would place new restrictions on TVA and expand=20

Medford also did not think that antitrust laws should be applied to TVA=20

Liquidity

EOL has allowed Enron to simultaneously provide internal and external 
customers with realtime  markets in many of the physical and financial 
products that we trade.  The ability of all customers to execute trades and 
receive instantaneous confimations has resulted in rapidly growing volumes 
and growing customer participation.  One of the benefits of this system is to 
allow all customers access to the market prices rather than being funnelled 
through third party brokers.  

Enron has committed to providing both depth of volume and tight bid/offer 
spreads. This committment has been main driver of the growth in volume since 
rollout last Nov.29.


Transparency

The existence of our two way market has removed all doubt about the firmness 
of bids and offers.  We will trade on the price and volume on our bid and 
offer.   The growing volumes over our system has lessened our dependance on 
the sometimes unreliable broker served market.  Many of our customers and 
competitors now use EOL as an information source as well as a trading 
vehicle.  EOL is the only service that provides free real time information on 
as many traded markets in the physical and financial worlds.  We have no 
competition in this regard.  This aspect of EOL has been helpful to the 
smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.  

Deal Flow

As the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading 
benefits.  We are collecting the bid/offer spread on our transactions and 
over time this results in a direct bottom line benefit.    Enron's market 
share of financial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become 
the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market.

I talked to Mike about this yesterday and he agrees the current allocation is aggressive.  I need to talk to Gary on Thursday about these changes and if nothing else, give him a heads up that we are going to do this.  The costs allocated to you related to Drift will definitely be reduced and I will have the revised numbers for you on Thursday.

Bay Area:
Pollutant:	Tons:		$/T		Cost
Various		46		$11		$0.5MM


Total:						$25.5MM


- San Joaquin could be sold for a $3MM - $6MM gain; we are proceeding with Calpine, Cantor and Enron desk.
- Sale of Roseville and Bay Area ERC's would result in a significant discount (40%-50%) because the air districts would be upset - basically, they could apply a transfer discount to the credits of 15%-25% and also could make future transfers conditional upon their approval (increasing risk for buyer).  
- Sale would also cause collateral damage to any future ERC activities (Enron would be seen as speculator/carpetbagger)

Recommendation:
Pursue sale of San Joaquin credits and put the balance in the global finance funding vehicle.  Initial indication is that transfer of credits for finance purposes is easy for an air district to accept.  I am setting up a call to discuss with finance, legal and Kelly Brodbeck.

Thanks for your help with Husnain.  I think he will be a solid asset for EBS

As for the ""trade"", I do not think that I should be brokering a personnel 
deal like that without the individual's input.  However, I would definitely 
encourage you to talk to any of my people that you would like to have.    I 
have an open door policy, if they want to pursue other internal jobs.  

After speaking with you last week, it was very clear to me that you were 
unsatisfied (unhappy) with my failure to be specific about individuals that I 
was recruiting.  I will not make that mistake again.  I would ask only that 
you inform Jim or myself of the individuals that you would want to recruit.

Additionally,  I think that you and Kevin Hannon have spoken about an 
exchange program in which our junior commercial people would be able to 
rotate through a transaction intensive trading group.  I think this type of 
program could be mutually beneficial and I would appreciate if we could talk 
about this in greater detail.

As of now I will also be working on the general A&A pool for ENA as well as working with you on the Trading and Orig. Tracks.    I just got the numbers from the A&A program on the ENA Participation on the forthcoming A&A Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interview dates.   As you can see ENA's participation is very low (pretty dismal).      The de-brief sessions basically allows interviewers to select the candidates to their groups there and then... so ENA has to be there.    

Oct 26 has only 5 ENA interviewers all the remaining interviewers are EES and EIM.    I know EES are stacking quite heavy on the A&A side.    Therefore, I will shortly be e:mailing your direct reports to solicit their and their direct report's participation in these interviews. It would be helpful if this could be re-inforced by you.

Many thanks!.

 The last two weeks were continuous negotiations with the government regarding rationing implementation measures, including drafting provisory measures that have force of law as well as resolutions to implement  them. 
I have met on a daily basis with Minister Parente in Brasilia and we continue to lead the sector efforts  advocating  our rights under the concession contracts, as well as the initial contracts signed with the government owned generators.  Sergio Assad is focusing on the implementation and  legal aspects of the measures.  Jo?o Carlos is focusing on the MAE ( energy market ) intervention and energy contracts. 

On Friday I met  with Pedro Malan, Minister of Fazenda, Brasil's most powerfull minister and possible presidential candidate in the 2002 elections,  to discuss Enron's and sector positions regarding the current situation and solutions for the path forward. On Monday I am meeting with Arminio Fraga, Central Bank President and in a separate meeting with Octavio Castello Branco, BNDES, Brazilian national development bank director, who is heading the multi-ministerial task force focused on resolving  pending issues regarding the thermal expansion program.  In all these meetings we are discussing the Cuiaba situation as well as our other projects and investment possibilities, stressing the necessary solutions to our existing issues as a condition precedent to further investment.   

The government has given this agenda top priority, especially due to the political/economic implications and the presidential elections in 2002, which will be in serious jeopardy for the President's party if the power shortages extend into next year.  We are focusing on implementing measure that protect our investments and create conditions for a competitive energy market.   

I will keep updating as we progress

We're not certain what FERC is after with this inquiry, but wanted to make sure you were aware of this development.   We are looking into this, and will get back to you asap with further information.

Just so you know, I was able to speak with Thompson about the E&P assets and that we would need $135MM.  He response was that the price was too high!  He wants to get together today with Jesus and me and discuss our valuation. 

I bet he calls you and I wanted  you to know that we are talking.

Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.    

Thanks,

Jim

1606,"SEABROOK P&L
Booking the 200 MW Seabrook position through for calender 2001 results in a 
positive $23.5 million.

For background purposes, UI has a 17.5% ownership interest in the Seabrook 
nuclear facility (total facility is 1142 MW).   The other owners of Seabrook 
are as follows:
  Northeast Utilities 40% (they are driving the sale - it is a condition on 
their Con-Ed merger)
  Great Bay Power  12% (they have announced their intention on selling)
  New England Power 10%
  Other minority owners 20% (8 small minority municipal & IOU owners)

The Seabrook facility has been on the auction block for the past 6-9 months, 
and given the uncertainty of the timing of the sale, Dana & I felt it was 
imprudent to book calender year 2001 until we knew with certainty that the 
plant asset transfer (and associated state, NRC and FERC approvals) would 
occur after 2002.  Remember contractually, EPMI's 200 MW PPA position 
terminates upon final closure of a UI sale of its 17% interest.   With 
respect to Millstone, Pilgrim and Maine Yankee nuclear asset sales, the 
majority owner drives the sale process and minority owners generally almost 
always sell their interest at the same price as the majority owner.   With 
respect to UI's 17.5%  interest in Seabrook, UI has already informed us they 
intend on selling their interest along with the majority owner.

Obviously, the plant has not yet been sold and I feel comfortable (given a 
10-12 month approval process coupled with Seabrook's politically sensitive 
location in New Hampshire) booking the 200 MW position through 2001.

ICAP P&L
Given the huge regulatory uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of ICAP 
in NE,  Dana is uncomfortable taking any of the $55 million to income at this 
time.   Basically, our opinion is that the regulatory decision will either 
result in a default price of $0.50-1.00/kW/Mo (resulting in approx $20-30 
million postive P&L) or a default price of $3-3.50/kW/Mo (loss of $20-30 
million).

The ICAP decision has once again been removed from the FERC agenda for next 
Wednesday's meeting.   This is the 3rd time that has happened in the past 2 
months and indicates a lack of consensus at FERC.   Given this FERC 
indecisiveness and the current situation in California and reliability issues 
in both the Western and Eastern US in general,  I am very concerned that FERC 
does not have the political guts to pull the plug on ICAP (or lower the 
default price to low penalty rate).

Given this regulatory situation, there is a 50/50 chance we lose additional 
money and a 50/50 chance we make additional money.   Said another way, we 
would likely use the entire $55 million in ICAP $'s to completely hedge ICAP 
through the term of UI.

In addiiton, there was a FERC ruling regarding PJM ICAP today that said 
$4.00+/kW/Mo for PJM ICAP was indeed market based and not market 
manipulated.  This coupled with FERC's lack of decision for 3+ months on NE 
ICAP makes us very uncomfortable.   The good news is we are not short PJM 
ICAP.

Hello.  Below are estimates on the vacation we discussed last week.  I
know that Jamaica was not a set destination but I really feel something
like the FDR Resort might be a good options for a family vacation.  One
of the biggest pluses is the nanny you are assigned upon arrival I think
most people find it really makes the vacation stress fee.  I will be
honest with you there are other resorts in the Caribbean that are nicer
but they are not family resorts.  Programs and things are offered for
children usually starting at 4 years (sometimes 3) of age nanny services
are not really provide and just babysitting that must be prearranged.  If
features like the nanny service are not as important to you then I will
make other suggestions.   I am not including rates on the Boscobel Beach
Resort because they just closed to do renovation that will last until
December 2001.  If you have any questions, need additional information,
or would like to set up reservations please do not hesitate to call or
E-mail.

Crystal Schwartz

On Monday, prior to my leaving for Buffalo,  I spoke with Dave Gorte and was informed that since the sale of the Napoleonville Land was greater than $2.5 MM, it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a DASH.  
 
Since the negotiations were quite contentious between Reliant, Texas Brine and Enron - we (Eva, Lisa and myself) had worked with Mr. Gorte to create multiple versions of the DASH.  It was not until Wednesday afternoon that Reliant was the chosen ""victor.""  In addition, since I felt you were apprised of the deal and Mr. Gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process, Lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule.
 
Unfortunately, this meant Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm, but we had been informed by Tammi Schoppe that you were available until 5 pm. Even though the banks were closed, I had wanted to sign the executables on Wednesday so Reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend.  It was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction.
 
I will be flying back to Houston today and will be landing around 5 pm.  Both Eva Rainer and Lisa Druzbik are in today and I am leaving instructions to (hopefully) close the deal today.  Julie Gomez will be signing on my behalf -- for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to Eva.  My cell is 713-302-4187.

I talked with Dave.  In addition to his original list we have agreed to the following.

Primary Metals - OK
Refining - OK
Grain and Meat Processing - Too broad.  Baughman should pursue deals but this category includes lots of small retail load.  Dave will think of solution.
Cement - OK
Auto - OK on Big 3, not the parts suppliers
Aerospace - No - EES has global outsourcing with Boeing and Lockheed Martin (the two biggest)
Paper Manufacturing - includes all forest products - OK
Glass - No - they have outsourcing with the largest companies already

In general, this seems reasonable, subject to middle-ground on dealing with agricultural processors.  fyi Baughman is negotiating with Archer Daniels Midland re a 300MW high load factor grain processing load and Luce has several deals with meat and grain processors.

b) Jeremy, it is important to have a view on the viability of getting these customers to agree to an assignment and releasing us on confidentiality issues so that we can approach dealers/producers/utilities with a tight book?
c) Vicki, clearly legal issues on the contract (ie) confidentiality, assignability, DASRing or assignment in a post non-deregulated California, etc.

These issues need to be vetted before we approach any producers.

The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
			          I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""	
		               She replies:	""No."" 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

1648,"We currently have $21.4 million in reserve for potential Northwest refunds.  $10 million currently sits in the LTCA book and $11.4 currently sits in the LTNW book.  During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding.

We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process.  One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market.  That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk.

I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million.  We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million.

In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC.  The draft decision recommended against any refunds.  This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year.  If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves.",,$21.4 million $10 million 11.4 close to $100 million roughly $30 million about $21 million,Northwest LTNW FERC Tacoma City Light Eugene Water and Electric Board Sacramento Municipal Utility District EPMI Charles River Associates CRA CAISO

1653,"My suggestions:

1)	Mountains (Jackson Hole, Aspen, Banff) are a nice respite from the Houston summer.  San Diego (or the Baja peninsula) are also nice - can combine golf, fishing and all kinds of outdoor activities.  More exotic locales could include Dominican Republic, Cabo San Lucas (5 championship courses in vicinity), Virgin Islands, Bermuda.  I'm not a big fan of Las Vegas (although there is some good golf in the area).

2)	Focus should be on (i) improving communication across business units (I'm surprised by the number of people on this e-mail that I don't know (well)) - perhaps presentations by each business unit reviewing 2000 and 1H 2001, (ii) identifying opportunities to profit from volatility in commodity and financial markets, (iii) create a ""road map"" strategic plan for the balance of 2001 and full year 2002.

3)	I love mountain climbing (lived in Switzerland for four years) and am happy to organize beginner course and/or expedition with trained mountaineers.  Great team building therapy.  Otherwise, I'm always up for golf, deep sea fishing, go kart racing, kayaking, skeet shooting, paint ball.

4)	Occasional off-sites are a great way to build/maintain morale and make sure everyone's on the same page regarding strategy/direction.

Call if you want to discuss in more detail.  I'm serious about organizing mountain climbing.

1654,"John,

This is my view on what may be possible:

Steve:	Issues:	1. Uncomfortable with UBS's committment to the business
		2. Surprised that no one from UBS has spoken directly with him
		3. Seems like he wants to build/run a team and is motivated by money.
		4. His interperetation of the contract is that even if this deal fails, his would be bound by a none compete until the end.

	Solution:  Money alone is not enough because does not address 1 and 2.  He needs someone (senior) from UBS to spend some time with him to:
		   (a) help him fell more comfortable with UBS's committment; (b) get him excited by the possiblity to lead/shape/direct the weather group
		   (this notion seemed to catch his interest during our discussion with him); (c) and present him with a new deal (no more of this aim for 80%
		   happy bullshit).  This new deal will need considerably less restrictive language--talk with Hunter about specifics.

Adam:	Issue:  1. Has interest in returing to the air force (his window to do so is until July 7th.)

	Solution:  Appears that money is not his first priority.  Any offer of money that precludes him from the July 7th window will be unsuccessful!
		   Our strategy needs to be one that gives him some respectable money that he can keep as long as he stays until June 1st (after he is
		   committed it may be possible to persuade him to stay longer).  He will not accept an offer that takes away his air force option!!!!!!  Also,
		   I think signing him will be alot easier once others have committed.

Jose:	Issue:	1. Recongnizes that senior management (You, Greg, and Louise) have done a good job closing the deal, but have failed to address HR
		    issues.  He thinks that this failure has existed much longer than just during the bankrupcy.  (Quoted, ""Mike had to fight way to hard
		    to get the very basic things for his team since day 1."")

	Solution:  The most difficult of the three to sell.  I think the ONLY hope would be for him to regain trust and respect for senior management. Senior
		   management would need to sitt with him and LISTEN to his issues!!!!

Mike:	Issues:   1. He wants out!!!!!!!!!!",John Steve Hunter Adam Jose Recongnizes Greg Louise Mike,,UBS

Hello.  Below are estimates on the vacation we discussed last week.  I
know that Jamaica was not a set destination but I really feel something
like the FDR Resort might be a good options for a family vacation.  One
of the biggest pluses is the nanny you are assigned upon arrival I think
most people find it really makes the vacation stress fee.  I will be
honest with you there are other resorts in the Caribbean that are nicer
but they are not family resorts.  Programs and things are offered for
children usually starting at 4 years (sometimes 3) of age nanny services
are not really provide and just babysitting that must be prearranged.  If
features like the nanny service are not as important to you then I will
make other suggestions.   I am not including rates on the Boscobel Beach
Resort because they just closed to do renovation that will last until
December 2001.  If you have any questions, need additional information,
or would like to set up reservations please do not hesitate to call or
E-mail.

At some point, I would be interested in speaking with you about some projects

Jane",Delaney David Jane,,
1665,"John:

I spoke with Tim yesterday evening regarding your feedback to the 
compensation proposal I sent last week. Before our conversation this morning 
I wanted to give you a chance to review some of thoughts I have which might 
help keep our discussion more focused. 

First, I think we've both been at Enron about the same amount of time and 
probably share similar experiences about contracts and compensation at Enron. 
In general, my experience is that there has never been any open information 
by management about any overall compensation structures, equity plans, 
compatability between ENA groups or other Enron companies. Just as we all 
have to create our own path at Enron we generally must do our own research 
and draw our own conclusions about compensation within and outside Enron. In 
several cases we have lost people we are trying to contract as a result of 
the contracting process! In my opionion, this is mostly because of the lack 
of communication of any ""overall compensation plan"" which drives people to 
the market to make an evaluation which they otherwise may not be inclined to 
do if information were available. Among the many ENA managers I have worked 
with none has ever explained any such ""plan"". Tim has indicated that there is 
some sort of overall compensation structure plan that you and Dave Delainey 
are trying to adhere to. I would appreciate some discussion about this as it 
may relieve some of the concerns we all end up having about signing a 
contract without being 100% satisfied with the minimum amounts in the 
contract (primarily because we've experienced the verbal commitment which is 
forgotten or lost in the latest management shuffle). 

Second, Tim indicated some concern about locking in certain minimum overall 
compensation levels and that ""if a person were to have a bad year there may 
be no room for bonus"". I think this is a real concern particularly when we 
consider a new trader from outside the company. In my case, while I currently 
don't have a specific book that gets marked each day, I think there is a 
clear record over the past seven years of significant value to ENA's west 
power business. This value comes in several forms: value above the 
offer/below the bid, market information driving both short and long-term 
value into our books, developing new markets and products for ENA, extending 
my market knowledge and deal structuring capabilities on a continuous basis 
each day to other origination/strucuturing/mid-market/real time groups, 
building a no-risk/high value Services business, and providing leadership to 
employees about their role at Enron or Enron's role in the market. All of 
these efforts are focused on adding mark-to-market value to ENA in more ways 
than any single, specific book can measure. I am certain that I will continue 
to add value in these ways and have little concern about this ""bad year"" 
scenario.

Finally, I am trying to make sense of the proposed compensation that Tim has 
relayed to me. If I understand it correctly my cash compensation pay would 
change from $206k ($130 base /$56 COLA /$50 retention) over the past three 
years as a Director to a base pay of $170k as a Vice President with higher 
expections and increasing responsibilities. The equity plan that is currently 
available to Vice Presidents and above would be locked in at values of 
$175/$125. This one is a little hard for me to evaluate as it is new in its 
current form (I have been a participant in prior years of similar equity 
plans which have ranged in initial from $10k-$50k as a Director). Bonus would 
be determined annually, I assume under similar process as past years. The 
trouble I am having is evaluating a significant decrease in cash compensation 
after being promoted and locking in a known (versus unknown) value in an 
equity plan for which I presumably am already a participant in and for which 
there is little other plan information available to evaluate.  I would 
appreciate your thoughts on this in relation to any overall compensation 
""plan"".

I'll look forward to our discussion.

THE HILL REPORT
A Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions
Week of September 30 - October 6, 2000


This Week in Washington, the United States House of Representatives
continued its work on the appropriations process for funding of the
fiscal year of 2001.  The House passed the conference reports on
the energy, interior and transportation appropriations bills.   We
also passed a continuing resolution agreement that will keep the
government running until all 13 appropriations bills are passed and
signed into law by the president.

On Monday of this week, as Chairman of the Congressional Results
Caucus and a member of the Congressional Cyber Security Caucus, I
toured the high-tech corridor of Boston, Massachusetts today to learn
about high-tech issues such as information security, e-signature
legislation and Internet taxation.

I organized the trip to draw attention to the need for more implementation
of information technology security not only among federal and other
governmental agencies but in the private sector as well.  The Congressional
Cyber Security Caucus exists in part to educate other members of
Congress and government agencies of the vital need for secure information
technology systems.

The trip came on the heels of a recent General Accounting Office
(GAO) report to Congress that clearly stated that too many government
operations and assets remain at risk of cyber attack.  The GAO discovered
serious security flaws at major federal agencies such as the Treasury
Department and the Department of Defense - situations clearly indicating
large potential threats to citizen privacy and national security.

Some of the computer systems that run our national defense and military
operations are literally an open target to hostile nations or terrorists
who have cyber terrorism technology.  Both accidental and intentional
attacks on these very systems have been detected and we must take
steps to stop them.

I was joined by Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier (R-CA), Congressman
Tom Davis (R-VA), Congressman Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), Congresswoman
Nancy Johnson (R-CT), Congressman John Sununu (R-NH), Congressman
Jack Quinn (R-NY), Congressman John Sweeney (R-NY), and other prominent
business, community and financial leaders.

We attended a meeting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
with area CEOs and high-tech leaders, representing the financial,
communications and technology community.  The discussion was hosted
by TechNet Massachusetts to discuss creating digital opportunities,
H-1B visas, protection of online privacy, and taxation of Internet
transactions.

I believe that any government agency using information systems and
is linked to the outside world MUST have an efficient and secure
information security system.  The potential privacy and security
threat is not something we should take lightly and unfortunately
too many high-level government officials are doing just that!

Any major business, industry or government organization must consider
the threat of cyber attack and how it could be a devastating situation
to customers and citizens.  I can't imagine any of my constituents
being interested in having their private banking information being
made public to anyone on the Internet.  Security and privacy must
be a priority and the businesses and organizations that possess this
sensitive information can not afford the risk of intrusion.

Members also met with high-tech officials, Governor Paul Cellucci
(R-MA), and Lt. Governor Jane Swift (R-MA) to discuss the future
of the information technology industry as well as pending legislation
in Congress designed to address the pressing needs of New Economy
companies.

Earlier this year, I digitally signed the ""The e-Contract 2000"" with
high-tech America to renew his commitment to promoting the New Economy
in the 21st century.

I pledge to continue my legislative and oversight efforts to remove
the barriers to future innovation, competition, and growth.  Freedom
is the answer, not government intervention.
The New Economy has created limitless opportunities in America today
for consumers, companies and workers alike.

The e-Contract 2000 outlines a number of policies the Republican-controlled
Congress has designed to promote continued growth in the New Economy,
such as ""Reducing Taxation, Regulation, and Litigation"" and ""Promoting
Free Trade and E-Commerce.""

Also this year I voted for continued growth in the new economy by
supporting the ""Internet Non-Discrimination Act"" (H.R. 3709), to
extend the current Internet tax moratorium for an additional 5 years,
through 2006.  The bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives
by a vote of 352-75.

The tremendous growth of e-commerce has created thousands of high-wage
jobs in this country and has led to countless new choices for Texas
consumers.  The group with me today believes the New Economy should
remain unfettered by burdensome taxes and regulation, to ensure continued
growth and innovation into the 21st century.

Around Texas...

Last Friday, I spoke to the advanced placement Government and Economics
classes at Palestine High School.  I pointed out to them that our
Constitutional form of government is really just an on-going experiment,
and that the continued success of our country depends on the participation
of all of our citizens.  I told them that I am confident that we
can solve every problem in America.  I always enjoy speaking with
enthusiastic young people, and I want to give every student an opportunity
to experience and understand our government.

On Saturday I went to the St. Thomas - Aquinas children's carnival,
and that evening I attended a fundraising event to benefit ""For the
Love of the Lake.""  This is one of my favorite community projects.
 I have adopted part of the shoreline of White Rock Lake, and would
encourage all of you to come help out at our ""Second Saturday Clean-up.""
 See my web site for more information.

Tomorrow I will see my friends in Anderson County at the Anderson
County Cattle Baron's Ball.  And in two weeks, I will be in Bryan
for a Town Hall Meeting.  See the notice at the end of this e-mail.

Next week Congress is hoping to finish its work on the budget for
fiscal year 2001.

Have a great weekend! - Pete

   AMCC Develops Zambezi, Offering STS Cross-Connect Solution for Line Card=
 Operations Up to 40Gb/s=1DDesigned to Interface Seamlessly With the Mekong=
 and S2509, Zambezi Completes AMCC's Comprehensive, Digital Cross-Connect S=
olution   SAN DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits =
Corp. (AMCC) (NASDAQ:AMCC) Monday announced Zambezi (S8710), an STS-1 cross=
-connect grooming fabric designed for line card use.   Targeted for add/dro=
p MUX systems, digital cross-connects and multi-service switches, this devi=
ce is optimized to enable 10Gb/s, 20Gb/s, and 40Gb/s line cards to be built=
 with an integrated first and last, or Nth, stage grooming fabric. This sol=
ution is capable of switching from the STS-1 level up to and including STS-=
768c traffic, including arbitrarily concatenated traffic. Zambezi's single-=
stage, non-blocking, switch architecture, easily enables broadcast and mult=
icast configurations. In addition, the device offers an industry-leading lo=
w power dissipation of 8W (typical).   Dual 768x768 (40Gb/s) logical-partit=
ioning of the internal switch fabric and dual-casted IO interfaces allow a =
single element to be used as the 1st and Nth stages of a larger, multi-stag=
e, CLOS switch. Zambezi is unique in offering dual-casted I/Os, allowing fo=
r seamless switching between the redundant core-stage switch elements. Sixt=
een I/O ports can be dual-casted allowing this device to directly drive and=
 monitor redundant, core-stage switch elements. Zambezi can also be used st=
and-alone or as the core stage element in a multi-stage fabric as a 1536 x =
1536 (80Gb/S) fully non-blocking switch.   ""Zambezi is an extension of our =
STS-1 switching capability previously demonstrated in our devices such as D=
anube and Missouri,"" said Neal Neslusan, director of marketing at AMCC. ""Th=
is is the first device which can be coupled with our next generation pointe=
r processors for capability of supporting traffic up to OC-768c.""   The cro=
ss-connect offers the capability to configure all of the I/Os to either 622=
Mb/s or 2.5Gb/s on a per I/O basis. Many of the pointer processors availabl=
e today that may interface to a device such as Zambezi, do not offer 2.5Gb/=
s I/Os. Zambezi's dual-rate IO capabilities support a direct interface to t=
hese pointer processor chips. This capability includes support of a direct =
interface to AMCC's recently announced Mekong device. Customers may choose =
to use Zambezi in conjunction with Mekong and S2509 for complete port densi=
ty utilization of the Zambezi.   Pricing and Availability  Zambezi (S8710) =
is offered in a 624-pin PBGA package and priced at $590.00 in volume quanti=
ties. It is scheduled for sampling in October 2001 and volume production Q1=
 of 2002.   About AMCC  AMCC designs, develops, manufactures, and markets h=
igh-performance, high-bandwidth silicon solutions for the world's optical n=

*** Inflation is no problem?

*** Sunset in Europe? False dawn in America?

*** Pigs, chickens and deformed ducks...

* * * * * * * * * * * Advertisement * * * * * * * * *

Making your first million isn't easy, but it's relatively
simple... it's the next 9 that are really difficult!

But with a relatively modest investment you can do it.
Learn the wealth-building secrets of the Decamillionaires -
people with a net worth of $10 million or more. You can
harness the secrets that many of the richest people in the
world have used to build their personal fortunes. You too
could turn a relatively small investment into a substantial
fortune.

Please read:
http://www.agora-inc.com/reports/STOP/SuperRiches/

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

*** Last week Dallas Fed chief McTeer proclaimed that the
stock market correction was ""overdone."" Yesterday, Chairman
Greenspan assured the nation, ""Inflation is not a
significant problem at this moment [and] there is also very
little in the way of short-term inflationary expectations.""

*** It is certainly comforting to know that our economic
woes are now behind us. Now that everything is settled, we
can get back to buying stocks.

*** Maybe inflation is not a ""significant problem,"" but he
can be a nuisance. And like an ill-mannered guest who
leaves beer cans in the planter boxes, he can make a mess
of things:
o   Most commodity indices have been heating up since late
    March.
o   ""Resource currencies"" like the Australian dollar and
    the Canadian dollar have been rallying of late.
o   Long-term bond yields have been rising ever since the
    Fed began cutting rates in January.
o   Until very recently, inflation-indexed Treasury bonds
    have been outpacing conventional bonds for months,
    suggesting that Mr. Market worries somewhat about resurgent
    inflation.
o   Even Old Man Gold rose from his rocking chair to
    stretch his legs for a spell before returning to the chair
    for another long nap.

*** And what of the Consumer Price Index itself? If it were
a common stock, momentum investors would take one look at
the CPI's upwardly trending price graph and start buying.

*** The revelation from on high that the inflation problem
is behind us boosted the Dow 71 points to 11,061 - once
again clearing the 11,000 mark. The Nasdaq managed only a
six-point gain.

*** ""It is the responsibility of economists to point out
false dawns,"" writes CLSA economist Eric Fishwick, who does
not see the sun rising on this economy just yet. Consumer
spending will be a critical component of any sustainable
upturn, he says. However, ""in real terms, retail sales have
stopped growing [and] they are not yet contracting, which
has happened in previous cycles.""

*** Meanwhile, the sun appears to be setting in the Old
World. Business confidence is weakening across Europe -
from Sweden to Germany to Spain.
""French manufacturers were more pessimistic in May then at
any time in almost two years as domestic and foreign orders
dropped,"" the International Herald Tribune reported late
last week. The index of business confidence, as compiled by
French statistics office INSEE, has dropped six months in a
row. As Deutsche Bank economist David Naude told the IHT,
""This is clearly a cold shower after they slightly crazy
idea that France could escape the international slowdown.""

*** Inflation has risen in Europe, unemployment is up too.
Economic growth, on the other hand, is down. Europe.like
America.faces the prospect of a recession. And Europe, like
America, turns its weary eyes to Alan Greenspan, the one
man who might rescue the situation. Bill has more, below...

*** The euro declined 8% in May - because of the weakening
economic picture in Europe, it is believed. It now stands
just a bit over 84 cents.

*** Part of the problem - or advantage, depending on the
way you look at it - in Europe may be that Europeans just
don't work enough. Richard Russell sites an OECD study
showing that Americans work far more hours than than Old
World counterparts. In 1970, for example, Germans and
Americans each worked an average of about 1900 hours per
year. But last year, Americans worked nearly 2,000 hours,
while Germans put in only 1700.

*** But who's better off ? People who work less and save
more ? Or those who work harder and harder to get
themselves further into debt ? You decide.

*** Have you read the ""Technology and Health"" page in the
""B- section"" of the Wall Street Journal lately? It has
become a kind of obituary page for technology companies.
Last Friday, page B2 reported that Tellabs struggles from
""worsening industry conditions,"" Hewlett-Packard's suffers
falling revenue from falling ""worldwide sales of computer
servers"" and Ibis Technology ""cut its staff 14%.""

*** Investors looking for a rapid turnaround in the
technology industry might want to take note of the latest
GDP report from Taiwan. The tech-heavy Asian economies
first-quarter report was its lowest in 26 years. Dante's
Inferno seems to anticipate tech stock investing in 2001:
""This way for eternal suffering. This way to join the lost
people...Abandon all hope, you who enter!""

*** According to a new study by two professors at the
University of Chicago, only 5% of analysts ever issue a
sell signal. J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Freudenstein must
be one of the few. He warned investors last Thursday to
think twice before buying the stock of either Merrill Lynch
or Goldman Sachs. The problem, as he sees it, is a
""continuing decline in investment banking activity.""

*** He didn't mention his employer. But, investment banking
produces 60% of J.P. Morgan's operating earnings.
Furthermore, as grantsinvestor.com's Andy Kashdan and
Robert Tracy point out, Morgan's investment banking
revenues fell 22% year-over-year in the first-quarter.

*** ""If one were to build a banking behemoth from scratch
with the idea of maximizing exposure to a weakening economy
and struggling capital markets,"" they write, ""the finished
product would bear a striking resemblance to J.P. Morgan
Chase.""

Eric Fry

And more notes of a less serious nature...

*** It was so beautiful in the country this weekend, it was
hard to leave. Pierre had cut the hay in the field behind
the house and rolled it into giant bales. Squint, and it
looks just like a painting by van Gogh.

*** Young animals of all species are adorable. We have baby
ducks, turkeys and chickens. One of the little ducklings
hatched with a bad foot. The poor thing hops and scuttles
around. ""I should probably put him out of his misery,"" Mr.
Deshais had remarked last week. Somehow, the duckling
survived - at least while it was enclosed in a protected
space. But now it is out in the fowl yard with about 30
other ducks, none of whom have ever heard the parable of
the Good Samaritan nor ever seen a handicap parking space.
The deformed duckling was still alive when we left last
night. But nature will take her course.

There are also four little pigs in the sty. We bought them
at a neighbor's farm just after they were old enough to be
separated from their mother. They were cute, too, rooting
around in the yard. Of course, adult animals can be
attractive too, with the right sauce.

*** Pierre spent Sunday afternoon fixing his hay rake.
""Every year it is the same thing,"" he told me. ""I drive
along; then I hear a clacking noise. It is not too bad at
first, so I wait. But it gets worse and worse. Then, by the
time I decide to stop the tractor and check, the noise
ceases. So, I don't worry about it... Of course, then I
notice that the rake isn't working. The noise stopped
because the piece finally broke off....so I then have to
search for it in the hay.""

DEBT EXPRESS


""We may make Atlanta, but we'll all be dead.""
 One of Jimmy Rogers' railroading songs

Clickety clack. Clickety clack.

There is always a lot of 'noise' in an economy. The latest
figures, for example, show such a mixture of facts and
figures that it is hard to make sense of them.

Corporations are issuing bonds at a record pace. $88
billion of them were taken up by investors in the month of
May alone. And, in early May the junk bond market had its
best week in 12 months, with $500 million flowing into the
risky investments.

Consumers seem to be heeding McTeer's appeal to patriotism.
Countrywide Credit reports that it funded $102 billion of
new mortgage loans in the month of April - and increase of
130% over a year ago. And Mercedes Benz reported its best
results ever in the month of May.

And there is the gold price. Down $9 last week, gold seems
to be telling us that inflation is, as our Fed chief tells
us, no problem. Gold stocks were less sure - declining only
5% over the week.

Meanwhile, the number of bankruptcies rose 17% in the first
quarter. So far this year, 581,105 people have declared
bankruptcy...up 23% from this period last year. What should
you make of that?

With all this racket, how will we know when the economy is
really breaking down?

It is hard enough to see what is in front of our very eyes,
let alone what is coming around the bend. Is the economy
expanding or contracting? No one really knows. We have to
wait to find out, looking backward to see where we have
been.

We don't know where we are, but most people believe they
know where they are going - towards the clear skies of
economic growth, full employment and 15% per year stock
market growth. No need to consult a map, nor even to look
out the window; Alan Greenspan is at the throttle. He's
wearing his Casey Jones cap and has his hands on the
controls.

As we found out yesterday, the throttle may not be
connected to the fuel line...and the brake may be more
operational in theory than in fact...but there is no need
to alarm the passengers. This train is bound for glory,
after all. Get on board now...or you'll be left behind!

""With effortless adjustments to short-term interest rates,
so the thinking goes,"" as Doug Noland put it in a recent
bulletin, ""central bankers have both the skill and capacity
to orchestrate positive and enduring effects to financial
markets, while stimulating just the right amount of
additional demand to perpetuate a non-inflationary U.S.
economic boom. With the Fed able and more than willing to
ward off any financial difficulty or economic slowdown, the
only thing to fear is fear itself.""

It is too late for business. Already fearful, business is
cutting back. Employees are being laid off. New projects
are being shelved - at least until excess inventories are
sold off.

Thank God for the consumer. ""With industry already in a
slump,"" explains an article at S.F. Gate, ""the only thing
that that has kept the nation out of recession has been the
willingness of consumers to dig into their pockets and buy.
That spending has been fueled by an ever-increasing use of
credit.""

Borrow, borrow, borrow, urges the Fed's McTeer. Spend,
spend, spend.
It's our only hope.

But there is a limit to how much debt consumers can handle.
Amid the clatter of news and facts, is a whisper of what is
being called ""consumer stress."" Credit counselors report a
30% increase in business this year over last. Bankruptcies
are increasing, as noted above. Consumers seem to be
'maxing out' their ability to borrow and spend. In April,
for example, people spent $49.7 billion more than they
earned. How long can this go on?

What the Fed can't do; it won't do. It can't erase
inventories, or turn a bad business into a good one. Nor
can it wave a wand and make consumers' debt balances
disappear.

What the Fed can do - lower the Fed funds rate...and
increase 'liquidity' - it can be counted on to do. The
funds rate can go to zero, and in real terms, below zero.
Will a funds rate of zero prevent stocks from regressing to
the mean? Will it light a fire under productivity and GDP
growth? Who knows. But in Japan, it had no such effects.

And liquidity? It 'has to go somewhere' is the popular
expression. But it might well go to rebuilding consumer
savings accounts...or offsetting deflationary consequences
of a stock market meltdown...or, yes dear reader, even to
increasing the price of bread, houses and movie tickets.

There were those - many and famous - who urged investors to
buy tech stocks and dotcoms a year ago. But only half the
population - the upper half by income - got to take
advantage of this advice. Consumers with more modest
incomes, or perhaps better sense, did not get a chance to
lose money on the tech mania. But now, they have an
opportunity to do something equally stupid: They can climb
aboard the Fed's 'Debt Express,' Destination: Unknown.

Your editor,

Bill Bonner

P.S. What the Fed cannot do might nevertheless happen. Alan
Greenspan, if nothing else, is famously lucky. It was his
great luck to step onto the #1 Engine at the Fed reserve
switchyard after Paul Volcker had sharply raised interest
rates thereby shut off the supply of oxygen to inflation.
It was Volcker who took the heat and did the dirty work.

Greenspan has had a downhill run ever since.. coasting on
the slope of declining interest rates, with no inflation
threat on the horizon.
Maybe he'll get lucky again.

As long term subscribers know, we have been more upbeat
than most in our economic outlook.  Now the recession
has disappeared and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
has exceeded the Nikkei.  What more could one ask for ?
We had always believed that prior to September 11th a
recession would have been avoided, but we were hoping that
the Dow would exceed the Nikkei at ""somewhat"" higher
levels.  All kidding aside, though, last week was positive.

To almost everyone's surprise, 4th Qtr GDP was positive,
but barely so.  So, for the record, at least until the
revisions are released, 2001 GDP growth by quarter was
+, +, -, +.  That doesn't officially qualify as a recession,
but there certainly was a profits recession, and that's
what counts.  Nonetheless, there is a message in the data.

Specifically, if such a mild ""recession"" can cause such a
severe erosion in corporate profits, the ""flip-side""
should be that leverage works both ways.  In other words,
as the economy recovers, profits could surprise on the
upside, even as we believe overall economic growth will
disappoint by ""snapping back"" less than consensus.

Although the 4th qtr GDP number was driven by consumer
spending, the personal income data imply that the consumer
should not hunker down.  The gain was the best since December
of last year, and with auto companies already announcing
deals, the price sensitive shopping trends should continue.

The other noteworthy item in the GDP report was the huge
drop in inventories, and yet overall GDP was still positive.
With consumer spending likely to be maintained, it seems
highly likely that the inventory correction is over, and
that production will have to increase in the near future.
In fact, some of the lead reports already imply that is
the case - say the new orders component of the Chicago
Purchasing Managers' Index.

The Labor Department Report was also a positive surprise.
However, at year end there are a lot of cross currents in
the numbers so we wouldn't read too much into the decline
in the unemployment rate. Nonetheless, it could have some
psychological significance, and help maintain the more
upbeat tone of consumer confidence.

And finally, there is the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) and their decision to leave rates unchanged, but
to maintain their bias toward lower rates.  As you know,
we expected the former, but thought they would remove
the bias given the rise in consumer confidence and the
three consecutive monthly gains in the leading indicators
series.  It appears that they are trying to micro manage
expectations, as the bias is clearly not needed.

My point is simply that Chairman Greenspan appears to be
becoming increasingly sensitive to financial market
reactions to the FRB's actions of any kind.  He went out
of his way to ""correct"" the negative impression, we would
argue misinterpretation, of one of his speeches.  Our view
now is that he wanted to leave the bias in place to drive
home his view, and ours, that the recovery will not be sharp.
And, of course, at a subsequent meeting they can remove the
bias, to reinforce perceptions of recovery.  We think such
an approach is a tad too cute, but probably harmless.

Overall, we obviously continue to like the economic data.
It supports our view of a recovery by Spring, if one hasn't
already begun.  Under such a scenario, earnings estimates
should at least hold, taking pressure off the stock market.
We'll see, but at the moment we like the risk/reward ratio.

Dear John Lavorato, Hunter Shively, Andy Lewis, and Chris Gaskill:

I regret to inform you that I will be resigning from the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture and will await further direction in the effort to fulfill my current obligations.  It is definitely with a bit of sadness that I have arrived at the conclusion to leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture, but I believe that it is in the best interest of my young career.  In addition, after signing a UBS offer letter I have realized over the last two days that given my current assignment it would be very difficult for me to continue to be motivated and to produce in the manner that would please both management and myself. Therefore I believe it is in the best interest of both parties that I leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture. Although this decision was not an easy one for me to make, I have decided to pursue other opportunities. 
I am extremely grateful for the opportunities I have been given here in this organization and for the investments that both you as individuals and the organization as a whole have made in my personal career development.  I believe I have worked hard at Enron and I trust that I made significant value adding contributions. It is because of my experience here and the tutelage that all of you have given me that I have my current knowledge and opportunities. I am very grateful for all of my experiences here at Enron/UBS Warburg, and I would like to personally thank all of you guys upon your return from Connecticut.  I will also make a concerted effort to maintain contact with all of you.
UBS Warburg Energy will certainly be a successful organization and I wish you all the best of luck with the exciting challenge of rebuilding this great business.
I await your direction upon receiving my intention to resign, and I offer my services in order to make the process as smooth as possible. 

Sincerely,

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.

 ","Irena Hogan 
Sr.",,"FYI Enron Americas 
"
1753,"To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization.

THE WEEK/Asterisk for Alan?

""In 1961, Roger Maris hit 61 home runs to break Babe Ruth's 1927 record.
Unfortunately, it took him eight more games than Ruth. For the next thirty
years, an asterisk differentiated his record from Ruth's 60 home run
total, denying Maris the satisfaction of his accomplishment.

""Today, as Alan Greenspan winds down his career, his otherwise stellar
record is threatened with an asterisk as well. After a record-breaking
recovery, high-tech stocks have crashed, the economy is closer to
recession than it has been in over a decade, and many think that inflation
is returning.

""The Fed has cut rates faster in 2001 than at any time since 1982, when
the economy was in the worst recession since the Great Depression and
inflation was rising at double-digit rates. Greenspan is managing the
economy on the run, reacting to economic developments, not anticipating
them. After years of seeming in control, the Fed looks out of control.""

IN THE DIGITAL POWER REPORT/Photon Power

""Low-power lasers can handle most bit-moving, think-and-see applications
just fine. Indeed, too much power becomes a problem when the objective is
to send a beam through the very narrow core of a strand of glass, or down
to the micron-sized pits on a compact disk. But our economy moves atoms,
too, and atoms are a lot heavier than bits. If it's powerful enough,
highly ordered light lets us move atoms--stuff--a million times better
than the old tools of the thermal and mechanical world. It permits
ultra-fine heating, soldering, drilling, cutting, and materials

telecommunications legacy of Alexander Graham Bell. The industrial
legacies of Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and Henry Ford come next.
The move laser is destined to become as ubiquitous in the atom-moving
economy as its low-power counterpart already is in CD players and desktop
printers. The second photonic revolution is at hand.""

IN NEW ECONOMY WATCH/Opportunity Knocks

""It took Microsoft's antitrust trial to convince Silicon Valley that
Washington DC had not already lapsed into the irrelevance it may well
someday achieve. That's clearly not the case at Enron, where CEO Ken Lay
(a former official of the old Federal Power Commission, it's worth noting)
isn't given to underestimating either the sharpness of political teeth or,
more importantly, the potential gold mines in deregulation. Lay was the
2000 Bush campaign's largest single contributor, which undoubtedly had
nothing whatsoever to do with the half-hour chat he got with Dick Cheney,
just as the Vice President was putting together the White House's new
energy initiative. Top of Lay's agenda: creation of an open national
electricity grid, where a markets-based innovator like Enron can skate
rings around entrenched local and regional utilities. No prizes for
guessing what's front and center in the Bush administration's energy
plans.

""But all that said, ENE's roller-coaster performance over the past six
months shows the kinds of curve balls that regulation (or in this case,
the mere threat of it, from California) can throw. And the energy circus,
for that matter, is a walk in the park compared with the professional
wrestling underway in telecom, featuring Beltway heavyweights such as
Austin-based SBC, the rest of the Baby Bells and AT&T, all demanding their
(often mutually exclusive) due. Rookie FCC referee Michael Powell is
making all the right deregulatory noises. What he needs now is Jesse
Ventura.""

FRIDAY FEATURE/Money For Nothing

In  those famously heady days of 1999, first-day IPO run-ups left an
amazing $37 billion ""on the table""--in the pockets of those lucky enough
to get a pre-market share allotments, rather than in the coffers of the
companies ostensibly raising money to fund their future growth. In the
first six months of 2000, another $20 billion followed--roughly twice what
the underwriters earned in fees, and an infinite multiple of many of the
issuers' actual earning prospects. Divide that by various burn rates, and
a lot of now-famous belly-ups might still be around.

""Money on the table"" has fuelled much gnashing of investor teeth, and
plenty of conspiracy theories as well. It's also the raison d'etre for our
good friends at W.H. Hambrecht & Co, whose Dutch auction-style IPO
underwriting is getting renewed attention in today's more
efficiency-conscious markets. In ""Why Don't Issuers Get Upset About
Leaving Money on the Table in IPOs?""  Notre Dame's Tim Loughran and Jay
Ritter of the University of Florida run the numbers on the whole amazing
business, and offer some theories about why it won't be going away anytime
soon. Download the full monograph at
http://bear.cba.ufl.edu/ritter/parnov.htm.

Microsoft Case Settled! No, the Other One

Some former Microsoft ""permatemps"" will have a little extra dough to
pay off their holiday Visa bills. Microsoft will pay about $97 million
to compensate 8,000 to 12,000 long-term temporary employees for the
stock-purchase plan they never had.

A spate of outlets ran the AP's coverage, including the allegation
that Microsoft's employment practices ""once allowed employees to be
classified as temporary for as long as 14 years."" (Temporary in the
Buddhist, ""all is transitory"" way, we assume). The average assignment
was 10 months, MS spokesperson Matt Pilla told Reuters. MS officials
also insisted that many temps don't want to go on payroll, since they
like the flexibility of temping and sometimes the pay is better. The
Washington Post and AP got some anecdotal evidence from former MS
temps who argue that most temps would rather be officially hired. As
for the money, ""How many stories have you ever seen about high-tech
contractors retiring at 35 because they made millions of dollars?"" a
former two-year temp asked the AP. ""If I had had access to what
everyone else had, I would be in the same financial situation as a
number of friends who are already retired,"" another former temp
complained to TechWeb.

Not that this is all about the bucks, some former permatemps said:
Microsoft hurt their feelings. They ""had to wear orange badges, while
regular employees wore blue badges"" and couldn't go to office parties
or shop at the discounted company store, said the New York Times. Nor
could they use the corporate health club, added the Washington Post's
writers, who also mentioned how much the temps hated those symbolic
orange badges. ""This dichotomy of treatment was a thorn in your side,""
one disgruntled former temp told the San Jose Mercury News. ""You were
trying to get your job done and constantly feeling like a second-class
citizen."" Sounds like the way most Microsoft techies probably went
through junior high.

To get a better sense of the eight-year legal wrangling surrounding
this case, peruse the New York Times, the Washington Post and the
Seattle Times. Basically, it comes down to this: Legal eagles say it's
not nice to employ people for more than a year and not let them into
the stock purchase plan, but temps are on their own for health
insurance. Microsoft got the hint in the mid-'90s, told contractors to
take at least 100 days off after sticking around for 12 months, let
about 3,000 employees trade their orange badges for blue ones, and
hooked up with temp agencies that provide good benefits. So maybe MS
temps get that health insurance after all, but ""the company still
doesn't give temporary workers the right to purchase its stock at a
discount,"" said the Merc.

Several outlets stressed the importance of this case to high-tech and
the business world in general, but the Seattle Times found a
contrarian. ""One thing that has been noteworthy is there haven't been
a large number of cases that have been filed (in the wake of the
Microsoft case),"" said the general counsel of the American Staffing
Association. Nor will the case have ""a material impact on our
results,"" said MS spokesman Matt Pilla. That $97 million won't make a
dent, but they can't let their contractors into the company store? -

1786,"Hey Guys. 

We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now 
Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to 
schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).

- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at 
Silverpeak(From PV or FC).
- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. 
($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)
- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)
- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account 
numbers below).

We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin. 

THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY 
ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS 
SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC 
and Sierra.



Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do 
not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I 
guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want 
competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they 
are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.  

It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.
If you have any questions over the weekend call me.

SPP - PAC: 853724
SPP-SNOHO: 853703
SPP-PUGET: 853725

always do).  

If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C.

Enron has with the FERC order is the bifurcated (two-tiered) auction 
program.  If the auction bids are less than $150/MW, they are presumed to be 
market clearing.  If above $150, they must show cost basis to support the 
price.  For purposes of this analysis, ""costs"" will not include purchase 
costs (ie. wholesale price paid), rather, they must be generation costs.

Enron is considering what forum would be appropriate to address the 
deficiency of the FERC order.  It is a contentious issue on all sides and 
there's likely to be vigorous debate.

1823,"TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16"" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20"" pipeline.

1830,"El Paso Merchant Ordered to Relinquish Data

FERC yesterday ordered El Paso Merchant Energy to stop stonewalling and turn 
over protected materials to parties involved in a complaint case in which 
it's alleged the affiliate received preferential treatment when it acquired 
1.2 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. 

Specifically, the Commission denied El Paso Merchant's request for rehearing 
of a June 2000 order that granted in part the discovery sought by the 
California Public Utilities Commission, and rejected rehearing of a September 
protective order. The latter directed El Paso Merchant to make available to 
all intervening parties, who agreed to the terms of the protective order, all 
of the materials that were being submitted to the CPUC and FERC in the case. 

So far, El Paso Merchant has refused to release the information to these 
parties, claiming the materials being filed with the CPUC and FERC are for 
""Government Eyes Only."" It also argues that the protective order offers 
inadequate protection of commercially sensitive information. 

The Commission disagreed. ""El Paso Merchant has not substantiated or 
sufficiently justified its broad claim that all of the 'protected materials' 
provided to CPUC and this Commission warrant the designation 'Government Eyes 
Only.' Indeed, all of the information that El Paso Merchant seeks to 
shield...relates directly to the issues,"" the order said [RP00-241]. Also, 
FERC finds that the protective order provides ""sufficient protection for El 
Paso Merchant's commercially sensitive documents."" 

The CPUC brought the complaint last April. It is seeking to abrogate the $38 
million contract arrangement between El Paso and El Paso Merchant. The agency 
alleges the affiliate was given ""preferential treatment"" by El Paso during 
the open season for the capacity, and thus the contract arrangement should be 
declared void. 

The CPUC and others contend the contract arrangement, which awarded more than 
one-third of El Paso's capacity rights to the California border to El Paso 
Merchant, is largely responsible for the high natural gas and electric prices 
in the state. They have urged FERC to ""act immediately"" on the merits of the 
complaint, but the Commission has yet to do so.

Transport Options filing.  Along with FERC staff, there were approximately 20 
intervenors present.  Although several of the parties' questions were 
intended to clarify the filing, others used the forum to attack collateral 
issues such as the affiliate marketing rule, pipeline capacity hoarding and 
the market power of Enron Online.  Going forward, TW is due to file pro-forma 
tariff sheets to include several clarifying items by Jan. 26, with parties' 
comments due on Feb. 13 and reply comments due on Feb. 23.

Capacity Marketing - Dynegy purchased several packages of firm transport from 
Blanco to Needles.  One package was 13,500 MMBtu/d for December 2001.  The 
other was 21,500 MMBtu/d for November 1 - December 31, 2002.  We will file 
negotiated rate letters with FERC for the index pricing.

1833,"American Electric Power Buys Houston Pipe Line

American Electric Power Thursday announced it has made a major move to expand 
its wholesale natural gas business in the Southwest, agreeing to acquire the 
2.4 Bcf/d Houston Pipe Line (HPL) along with the Bammel storage field, one of 
the largest storage fields in North America, from Enron. AEP said since some 
details remain to be worked out, it was not disclosing the terms of the 
transaction at this time. AEP will be acquiring the stock of HPL and it 
expects to complete the deal in the next couple months. 

HPL, one of the two original pipelines joined by Enron Chairman Ken Lay to 
form the company in the mid-1980s, has an extensive 4,400 mile transportation 
and gathering system through southern Texas. The 118 Bcf Bammel field, 
located near the Houston Ship Channel market area, has a 65.7 Bcf working gas 
capacity and is known for its fast in and out capabilities. It has a 1.4 
Bcf/d peak withdrawal rate and a 365 MMcf/d injection capacity. 

""Adding HPL to our natural gas asset portfolio will help us reach our goal of 
becoming a top-10 gas trader and marketer,"" said Paul Addis, executive vice 
president for AEP. The company currently is second in the U.S. in electricity 
volume. ""HPL will enhance AEP's natural gas business with its multiple 
connections into the production areas of Texas, its numerous interconnects 
with intrastate and interstate pipelines and its position in and around 
Houston as a premier provider of natural gas."" 

AEP, headquartered in Columbus, OH, has numerous power generation plants in 
the Midwest and Southwest, including a number of gas-fired plants in Texas. 
In 1998 it bought the Louisiana Intrastate Gas (LIG) system. 

John Olson, energy analyst with Sanders, Morris & Mundy in Houston, said ""for 
55 years HPL has enjoyed a reputation as one of the strongest pipelines in 
the country. As a stand-alone operation it is first class. It's a very, very 
strong asset."" He said HPL has been showing losses of $50 million a year or 
more in recent years, ""but those numbers are meaningless"" because Enron has 
been using it at discounted transportation rates to underpin its marketing 
efforts. Olson said the sale is a continuation of Enron's move to sell most 
of its hard assets and become a soft asset player. ""They are emphasizing 
their trading. They are doing far better at trading."" 

For one Houston-based risk manager, the sale of HPL by Enron was a question 
of rate of return. The competition among intrastates in Texas is fiercely 
competitive and for gas delivered to the Houston Ship Channel it can be a 
game of half-cents, with a shipper on one of the multiple intrastates 
undercutting another to try to shave a profit, he said. Enron recognized this 
and wanted out, he speculated.

1844,"The Enron Health Center has remained in contact with our Occupational 
Medicine Advisor and the Houston Public Health Dept. regarding the meningitis 
outbreak and recommendations for vaccinations.  At this time, the Houston 
Public Health Department does not consider the present cases of  meningitis 
as an epidemic.? They have provided us with the following guidelines based on 
input from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
?
The CDC has defined the highest risk groups as  the following:
1. children less than 2 years of age
2. groups of individuals living in confined spaces, i.e. college dorms and 
military recruits
3. individuals that are  immunocompromised
4. individuals with a damaged spleen or no spleen
5. travellers to sub Saharan Africa or the Middle East
6. close contact with infected individuals through sneezing, coughing, or 
saliva exchange.
?
The CDC has described an outbreak as 10 cases per 100,000  population during 
a period of 3 months.? They recommend vaccinating high risk individuals 
living in?high risk areas.? However, mass vaccination for individuals not 
living in those areas is not recommended at this time.?
?
In order to assist Enron employees that are living in high risk areas 
(Conroe, New Caney, Kingwood) we are attempting to obtain the meningitis 
vaccine.  If you are interested in the Enron Health Center providing the 
vaccine to self and family members (dependants over the age of 2 years) 
please contact the Health Center at  X36100 so that we may calculate the 
amount of vaccine we will need to have available and to set up appointments.  
We calculate the employee cost of the vaccine to be approximately $85.00.  

If anyone is concerned about a previous exposure from someone  in the high 
risk area, they should contact their primary care physician  regarding 
vaccination or the Texas Department of Health. The Texas Department of 
Health's website  for information regarding meningitis is

1851,"Note:  Williams does not give the amount of volume response they received in 
their open season.  540,000 Dth/d was their
established volume at the onset.  Also, it is interesting that they are 
naming the Oklahoma intrastate markets as their market
for the project.

Western Frontier Pipe Gets Rave Reviews

After successfully completing a non-binding open season on Sept. 21, for the 
Western Frontier project, Williams' gas pipeline unit plans to hold a binding 
open season in the near future to gauge the exact market interest in the 
project that would transport gas supply from the Rockies to the mid-continent 
region. 

""We are very pleased with the interest the market has shown in our Western 
Frontier Project. We continue to believe that Western Frontier will be a 
cost-effective way to bring economically-priced Rockies supply into the 
mid-continent,"" said Kim Cocklin, vice president of customer services and 
rates for Williams' Central and Texas Gas pipeline systems. 

The Western Frontier Project is expected to transport up to 540,000 dth/d 
from the Cheyenne Hub to Williams' Hugoton Compressor Station on the Central 
system in southwest Kansas and its Oklahoma-Hugoton pipeline. 

The project would also have access to ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern 
Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline of America. Williams 
believes this project would be able to supply a ""seamless transport at an 
incremental cost"" to Oklahoma intrastate markets by way of the Central 
system. Through the Central system, customers would also be able to access 
storage including directly owned and third party storage fields. 

Williams expects Western Frontier's rates to Hugoton to fall in the mid-20 
cents per dth. The company also expects a fuel rate of less than 1%. Expected 
to be in service during November 2003, the project will require the 
construction of almost 400 miles of pipeline and the addition of 13,000 HP.

1852,"Southwest Gas - Conversations with SWG indicate that somewhere along the 
construction path for the interconnect, TW approved the installation of the 
meter bypass piping (we are waiting for engineering to confirm this).  If 
this is the case, we will ask SWG to install skillets or padlock the valves 
so it cannot be used without TW approval.  In addition, we are proposing to 
amend the start date of the SWG transport contract so that TW may resell the 
unused space in early November on a daily firm basis.  

USGT - US Gas Transportation is protesting the Market Center deal we 
negotiated during our brief September outage.  We re-negotiated the original 
invoice from $140,000 down to $113,000.  USGT has countered with $65,000 
citing mis-communication on the original deal.

Plains Farmer's Co-op - Higher gas prices have created an additional level of 
credit exposure across our customer base in terms of transportation 
balancing.  For September, this small Co-op had accumulated a balance payable 
to TW of approximately $440,000.  The customer indicated they would be 
sending us a payment of $250,000 but so far has only sent in $75,000.  Our

In R. 98-01-011, the record reflects dissatisfaction among customers and=20

through its windowing system, and SoCalGas=01, sole use of the Hector Road=

(Prehearing Conference of September 1, 1999, p. 34.)
We are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowi=

Customers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will be=20

This system eliminates the mystery in how pro-rations are made, provides=20

and provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the most=20

of locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the term=
. =20
In this period of gas price volatility, we believe that the more flexible=

plan is the right one.
Thus, we direct SoCalGas to withdraw Advice Letter 2837 and file a new advi=

In R.98-01-011, PG&E and Edison particularly complained about the=20
restrictions at Wheeler Ridge. (Exh. 15 in R. 98-01-11, pp. 7-9 (PG&E=20

(Southern California Edison, Market Conditions Report).) One response in th=

IS to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point at=20

of receipt points is useful.  Hector Road may not entirely alleviate the=20
problem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south.
Therefore, we approve that portion of Section III of the IS that sets forth=

criteria for expansion, but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria,=
=20
SoCalGas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt point=

1872,"Fuel cells kindle investor energy
By Beverly Goodman
Redherring.com, November 27, 2000 
Companies with no earnings. Market capitalizations in the billions even 
though revenue hovers in the tens of millions. Analyst optimism bordering on 
the feverish. We know -- this probably sounds all too familiar. But this time 
we're not talking about some pie-in-the-sky dot-com stock valuations. We're 
talking about companies with new technologies, tangible assets, and a clear 
source of future revenue. We're talking about makers of fuel cells, a highly 
efficient and environmentally sound means of generating electricity. 
And while we won't deny that the recent run-up in their stocks befits the 
pattern of investor enthusiasm for the latest fad, we at Red Herring expect 
that alternative energy will be in fashion for quite some time. Investors 
more interested in companies that sell dog food over the Internet can stop 
reading here.
There's no mystery why fuel cells are an appealing source of energy: they 
provide more reliable and efficient power with lower emissions and noise than 
traditional generating sources (see Trend No. 9: Energy, December 4). Most 
only require the simplest of gases and throw off only water and heat as 
by-products, both of which are reusable. Simply put, fuel cells consist of 
hydrogen and oxygen, separated by a catalyst. Typically, the fuel cell is 
heated, causing a chemical reaction that generates electricity. Since nothing 
is burned, no pollutants are created. In time, proponents say, fuel cells 
will power everything from your cell phone to your car to the factories that 
manufacture them.
During this era of greater environmental awareness and rising fuel prices, 
fuel cell technology is increasingly looking like an appealing investment. 
Stocks powered by fuel cell technology are up an average of 139 percent in 
the last 12 months. That's despite a slow recovery from the 40 percent hit 
they took in the spring. The Nasdaq, by comparison, has fallen 15 percent 
since last November.
Investor interest has also prompted a recent spate of IPOs. H Power (Nasdaq: 
HPOW), Millennium Cell (Nasdaq: MCEL), and Proton Energy Systems (Nasdaq: 
PRTN) all went public within the past few months. While those IPOs may seem 
to coincide neatly with the rising cost of fuel, that's not the whole 
picture. ""We're seeing a convergence of factors never seen before,"" says 
William Fogel, a power technology analyst for First Albany. ""The deregulation 
in the utility industry has increased innovation; the transportation grid is 
in jeopardy thanks to an increase in electrical demand from an Internet-based 
economy; there's a growing need for increased reliability; and there's an 
increasing recognition of the environmental degradation caused by the 
combustion engine.""
Admittedly, truly widespread applications remain more than a decade away, so 
profits are similarly distant for fuel cell companies. But investors have 
proven themselves willing to invest in technologies long before they become 
mainstream, buying stocks that often defy traditional valuations. (Still 
holding JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JDSU)?) With early-stage fuel cell technology 
due out of the labs and available to individual and corporate consumers 
within the year, this is still the early part of the adoption (and investing) 
curve.
CELL DIVISION
The fuel cell market is generally divided into four segments: stationary, 
portable, residential, and automotive. Fuel cells will likely hit the large 
stationary market first, powering strip malls and factories, according to 
David Redstone, editor of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Investor newsletter. 
""We're talking about unprecedented efficiency,"" he says, noting that fuel 
cells approach 60 percent efficiency (that is, 60 percent of the potential 
energy in fuel entering the cell actually results in energy coming out).
Fuel cells can also be coupled with turbines to get their efficiency up to 80 
percent, whereas traditional combustion engines only run at 35 percent 
efficiency. The leading developer of these stationary cells is Fuelcell 
Energy (Nasdaq: FCEL) (FCE), which is poised to be the first to commercialize 
them in 2001. At first blush, FCE's 442 percent run-up in the last 12 months 
and the fact that it won't be profitable until 2006 doesn't make its $59.50 
stock price and price/sales ratio of 58 seem cheap. But using a variety of 
metrics, including discounted cash flow, discounted 2006 net income, and 
discounted 2006 revenue, Lehman Brothers analyst Maureen Murphy considers FCE 
undervalued by 40 percent. Using a projected market value of five times 
estimated 2006 revenue of $1 billion, she applies a discount rate of 17.5 
percent annually to arrive at a 12-month price target of $124.
Portable applications for fuel cells, like generators and boat engines, are 
also expected to be commercialized soon. Ballard Power Systems (Nasdaq: BLDP
), with more than 370 patents issued or pending, has proven itself in nearly 
all fuel cell applications and has promised to bring a small fuel 
cell-powered generator to market in 2001. ""They don't make promises they're 
not able to keep,"" says Christine Farkas, a senior specialist and director at 
Merrill Lynch. ""They've never disappointed."" Ballard has also made 
significant strides in the automotive market and owns 27 percent of Xcellsis, 
a fuel cell engine maker that is a joint venture with DaimlerChrysler (NYSE: 
DCX) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F).
Analysts expect Ballard to continue to post losses until sometime in 2004, 
and its current price-to-sales ratio is a whopping 265. Still, Ballard's 
involvement in all aspects of fuel cell applications leads Ms. Farkas to 
expect the company to earn $24.22 per share by 2013 -- which works out to 
approximately $2.2 billion in net income. Applying a multiple of 25 to those 
earnings, and a 15 percent discount rate, she comes up with a projected stock 
price of $150 a year from today, or 93 percent above recent prices.
INDUSTRY REVOLUTION
Even though powering cars with fuel cells is still some years off, the notion 
has found allies in some unlikely industries -- the major oil and automotive 
sectors. Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. declared at the 2000 Detroit 
Auto Show, ""Longer term, the fuel cell will end the 100-year reign of the 
internal combustion engine."" Legislation such as California's mandate that by 
2003 fully 10 percent of cars sold (an estimated 22,000) must run on 
alternative energy will also help speed industry and public acceptance.
While not a pure-play on fuel cells, Impco Technologies is well positioned to 
see its fuel cell business grow along with its other alternative fuel 
delivery, storage, and power electronics systems. Mr. Fogel expects Impco's 
products to compete for 40 percent, or $5 billion of the forecasted $12.5 
billion automotive fuel cell market in 2010. (Its much more down-to-earth P/S 
ratio of 1.6 is an added attraction for investors -- any risk involved in 
Impco's fuel cell development is hedged by its full involvement in the 
alternative fuel industry.) ""They're involved with almost every aspect of 
General Motors's global alternative fuel production, design, and 
implementation efforts,"" Mr. Fogel says.
Impco was hit particularly hard this spring, and is still, at $18, 65 percent 
off its March 6 high of $52. But by using a 45 multiple on projected 2006 
earnings per share of $2.86 and applying a 20 percent discount, Mr. Fogel 
arrives at a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of less than one -- a 
conservative multiple for stocks with similar growth prospects. Mr. Fogel 
sees more than a 100 percent upside for the company's stock, expecting it to 
return to its high in the coming 12 months.
Despite the industry hype and science fiction scenarios, there will 
inevitably be setbacks. Take, for example, Plug Power (Nasdaq: PLUG), which 
ran out of gas when General Electric (NYSE: GE), which owns one-third of a 
joint venture with Detroit Edison (NYSE: DTA) and Plug, decided to change 
course. Plug's trailing 12-month revenue of $13 million (giving it a 
price-to-sales ratio of 64) hinged on the venture, in which a fuel cell 
powered a house, independent of the local electrical grid. Instead, GE now 
wants to develop a ""grid parallel"" system, which would work in tandem with 
the existing system. That news, coupled with management woes and Nasdaq 
turbulence, sent Plug's share price falling 80 percent, from $140 on March 13 
to $16.50 on November 24. It will take all the energy fuel cells can generate 
to get that stock back on track.

Mr. Alan Kent
Flair Construction Co., Inc.

RE: Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction
Co., Inc., as Seller, and Mike & Chris McConnell, as Buyer

Dear Mr. Kent:

We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract.  On behalf of Mr. &
Mrs. McConnell we would like to make the following comments and suggestions.

Generally, our major concern is what happens if in the unlikely event Mr. &
Mrs. McConnell cannot reach an agreement with you regarding the construction
of their home?  The Homesite Reservation Agreement states that they must
sell the lots back to you as the Developer at seventy five percent (75%) of
the sales price if you, as the Builder, do not start construction within six
(6) months of the date the lots were purchased.  In such an event, Mr. &
Mrs. McConnell would lose a substantial amount of money.  Therefore, we
would like to know if you have any suggestions as to how to address this
problem.

We make the following specific comments regarding the Unimproved Property
Contract itself in chronological order.

1. Paragraph 2, Property.  As we discussed, we would like to get a copy of
the Deed Restrictions as soon as possible so as to make sure that Mr.
McConnell's house will not be atypical for this subdivision.

2. Paragraph 5, Earnest Money.  We suggest that the Earnest Money be paid to
the Title Company.

3. Paragraph 6, Title Policy & Survey, A.Title Policy (6).  In view of the
fact that The Lakes at Sterling Gate is a new subdivision, we have suggested
to Mr. & Mrs. McConnell that they request that the exception as to
discrepancies, conflicts, shortages in area or boundary lines, encroachments
or protrusions or overlapping improvements be deleted from their Owners
Policy of Title Insurance.  We understand that Mr. & Mrs. McConnell will
have to pay the additional cost for this exception to be deleted.  However,
before the Title Company will delete this exception it is necessary that a
survey of the lots being purchased be provided to the Title Company.  Do you
have or can you provide such a survey?

4. Paragraph 6, Title Policy & Survey, Notice to Seller and Buyer (6).  We
ask that this paragraph relating to your right to continue to show the
property for sale be deleted.

5. Paragraph 7, Property Condition (B).  We suggested to Mr. & Mrs.
McConnell that subparagraph one (1) be checked rather than subparagraph two
(2) reflecting that the Buyers are accepting the property in its present
condition.  Mr. & Mrs. McConnell intend on hiring an inspector and we
thought it may be a good idea for the inspector to have an opportunity to
inspect the property itself before construction.  Therefore, we ask that a
small option fee be put in to this paragraph and that Mr. & Mrs. McConnell's
inspector has thirty (30) days to check out the property accordingly.

6. Paragraph 8, Brokers Fees.  It is our understanding that Mr. Larry
Williams of Prudential, Gary Greene Realtors represents Flair Construction.
Therefore, we would ask for an affirmative statement that any brokers' fees
be paid by Flair accordingly.

7. Paragraph 11, Special Provisions.  It is written in that the closing on
these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March 1, 2001 which
ever is later.  However, we do not know what roads are being addressed and
think that this sentence needs far more specificity.  The second sentence
regarding Mr. & Mrs. McConnell's obligation to use Flair Homes has already
been addressed.  The third sentence regarding when construction must start
should be revised to give Mr. & Mrs. McConnell more time to hire an
architect, etc.  We would suggest one hundred and eighty (180) days.  Also,
once Mr. & Mrs. McConnell notify you that they are ready for construction we
believe you should be under an obligation to start construction thirty (30)
days thereafter.

8. Paragraph 13, Rollback Taxes.  As you know, if there was every an
agricultural, timber or other exemption on this property, this paragraph
states that any rollback taxes will be paid by Mr. & Mrs. McConnell.  We
want to make absolutely certain that no such exemptions exist.  Therefore,
if you could ask that Title Company to provide a Tax Certificate showing
that no exemptions exist before closing we would appreciate it.  If there
ever were such exemptions, we need to be made aware of that as soon as
possible.

9. Paragraph 18, Escrow.  As we indicated earlier, we believe the Earnest
Money should be paid to the Title Company.  Since the Earnest Money is in
excess of $50,000.00 and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain,
we believe the Title Company should be asked to deposit the Earnest Money in
an interest bearing account and that Mr. & Mrs. McConnell should receive a
credit accordingly.

We would appreciate it if you could respond to each of our suggestions and
comments in this letter as soon as possible.  We know Mr. & Mrs. McConnell
are very much looking forward to working with you in connection with
construction of their home.

Very truly yours,



Donald S. Stirman

Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. 
""We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project"" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. 
The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
The non-binding open season, which began last Tuesday, will run until Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. CDT.

compressor at San Arroyo, (2) increased field pressures, and (3) comments by
Wildhorse field personnel concerning a potential lawsuit with Crescendo over
pressure.

In subsequent conversations between Dan Rieneke and Wildhorse personnel
yesterday, the following information was relayed:

(1)  The CAT compressor was used only for the Natural Buttes gas being
routed through the South Canyon area.  We are not sure where they took it.
It was most likely a rental unit.
(2)  Increase in field pressures late last week was due to a compressor
going down.  Overhaul of that unit was not complete until late yesterday
(Monday), and we should have started to see some pressure relief again last
evening.  Putting the compressor back on line will only restore pressures to
their levels prior to the shutdown.

confused the relationships of Marathon, Mariner and MEGS. As an example you 
have requested that the LOPSA rely on the O&M Agreement between Mariner and 
MEGS, which Marathon is not a party.  We would rather that agreement remain 
between MEGS and Mariner and be the basis for your resolution of disputes. 
The legal capacities presented in your response to the LOPSA draft are 
confusing. All rights seem to flow to MEGS, yet the obligations seem to be on 
Mariner, we do not believe the division of rights and obligations in this 
manner are a good situation. By example the Indemnity provisions have been 
altered to have Mariner indemnify the Owners and Operator (no mention of 
MEGS)and then further change the indemnity to a negligence based indemnity 
(of Platform Operator). The PHA is a unilateral indemnity to Platform 
Operator and Platform Owners and we must insist on this same level of 
protection with MEGS.
If you would like to make another attempt at either a ratification or LOPSA 
that addresses MEGS as Lessee and Mariner as its operator and provide for any 
resolution between those two in the O&M Agreement we would be happy to 
discuss this further. If you would like to go through the LOPSA line by line 
please call and we can set up a teleconference with our legal department to 
do so.

2007," In order to provide better oversight and control of ENA legal expenditures 
on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth 
below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to 
exceed $25,000.00.  The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve 
communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services 
and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific 
transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.  Every effort should 
be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become 
standard at ENA.

 1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written 
description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The 
responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve 
such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide 
substantial professional services.

 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised 
written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and 
expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by 
$25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by 
the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee 
before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional 
professional services. 

 3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be 
properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should 
be obtained for each transaction.  

 Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or any other 
suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544.",,"25,000.00",ENA the General Counsel

left, we still have several exciting fundraising activities taking place.  
All walkers should continue getting pledges and watch for further 
instructions on turning in the walk forms.  Everyone has done an incredible 
job this year.  Great news, we are getting very close to reaching our goal, 
but if we want to continue to be the number one walk team in Houston, we need 
to continue with our fundraising efforts.  Please plan to join us for the 
following activities this week:
 
Silent/Cyber Auction - The JDF Silent Cyber Auction will open for bids on 
Wednesday, October 25th, at 8:00 a.m. and will close on Thursday, October 
26th, at 4:00 p.m.  You may access the Cyber Auction to place your bids at 
8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th, by launching the website at 
http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf  or go to the Enron home page on the 
Intranet and click on the JDF Cyber Auction.  For more information, contact 
Sophie Patel at ext. 35055 or Eddie Sera at ext. 30480.  

Bake Sale and Raffles - Just in time for the Holidays!  On Friday, October 
27th, we will have several groups selling delicious baked goods on the second 
floor level of the Enron Building outside the Energizer.  In addition, we 
will have representatives from some of our walk teams available for the 
purchase of raffle tickets at the same location.

For all that are not signed up, please join us in the walk.  You still have 
time.  It will take 2 minutes to fill out a walk form, you get a great 
Enron/JDF T-shirt for collecting or donating $25 or more, and will join 
hundreds of Enron employees and approximately 10,000 Houstonians for the walk 
on Sunday, November 5th, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I promise this will 
be a blast.  The Enron tent will be great again this year!  We will begin 
with a continental breakfast prior to the walk and when everyone returns from 
the walk we will have music, balloons for the children and wonderful Frankie 
Mandola's hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.  Parking at the Sam Houston Race 
Park is free.  You will be part of something very worthwhile and it will make 
you feel great.  This is a world class event.

Please contact any of the following Steering Committee members to make a 
donation, sign up as a walker, or ask any questions you may have.  Come join

2030,"Tony,  The following steps follow the contract amendment (assumes Bloomfield 
contract):

1.  Calculate the number of hours that the driver was down for force majeure.
2.  Subtract the hours in #1 from the total hours in the month.
3.  Calculate the Monthly Contract Quantity as defined in the amendment 
(Bloomfield -- 7000 times # of hours developed in #2 above)
4.  Calculate the Load Factor as defined in the agreement.

Since we don't have a load factor during those hours of the Force Majeure 
Event, we assume that the unit would have run at the load factor in #4 above 
if not for the Force Majeure event.

Thus, 

5.  Multiply the Load Factor times 7000 (max HP-hrs) times # of hours of 
force majeure event.  This gives you the equivalent HP-hours that would have 
been used during the Force Majeure event or Supply Interruption.
6.  In accordance with the amended Section 3.2(a), to calculate HP-hour 
charge do the following:

 Multiply Conversion Factor (taken from Exhibit based on load factor) times 
(Shaft Energy delivered + Equivalent   HP-hours during Force Majeure [this is 
the number calculated in #5 above]) times 1.031.

talked further with Dan concerning the contract.    We feel that the 
agreement strictly refers to facilities that are directly operated by the 
state (e.g. universities and prisons) and not school districts.  Thus, we 
would consider HISD to not be state facilities.  This argument is not a slam 
dunk, but we should probably take this approach and see how they react.  The 
contract also refers to gas ""destined"" for state facilities.  So the fact 
that the gas goes through another pipeline before being delivered to a state 
facility does not matter.  It ultimately is ""destined"" for state facilities.

2110,"Here is a summary of my telephone conversation with Jay Hopper of KN Energy:

1.  KN has permitted its 550 MW Arkansas plant (and received its Entergy 
interconnection agreement) and is out for bid on tolling agreements.  They 
have two counterparties who have bid a 15 year tolling agreement --437 MW, 
mid 7,000 heat rate; 5.75 KW-mo.; 113 MW duct firing, 4.75 KW-mo.; 3.00 mill 
escalating variable O&M charge.  KN has also conducted construction bids. 
[For our LM-6000 activities, seeing all this information would be extremely 
valuable].

2.  KN has a draft air permit on its Jackson Michigan plant.  They will know 
in 45 days if approved.  All other permits received. Since this project was 
first in the cue when we last talked to KN, I suspect something negative has 
happened to slow it down.

3.  KN has sites in Oklahoma, Dallas and Chicago (4).  

4.  KN and another party have 6 7FA turbines for June '01 projects in 
Illinois.  KN supposedly controls the turbines.  I asked KN if they would be 
interested in doing deals in other states with these turbines.  They said 
possibly.  The other counterparty would need an equity participation in the 
end project.  I also told them that to the extent that they did Illinois 
projects, we could be of assistance to them on reg. cap. pricing and sales 
tax strategies.

5.  KN has sites in Ohio and Geary, Indiana where a coal affiliate would take 
back a 30 year 100 mw PPA for both sites.  Given this contract, KN may 
entertain doing a deal with a merchant component.

6.  I asked Jay how KN would be interested in ENA participating in these 
projects.  KN is not interested in taking too much commodity risk.  Hence, 
our proposal of doing a fixed price toll for 5 years and a floating index 
price for an additional 15 years would not be of interest to them (evidently 
Kinder laughed at the proposal; though in Jay's telephone message he 
indicated that Kinder was interested in the structure).  If there was a floor 
that covered debt service in the merchant years (along with some upside 
participation for KN--Jay threw out a 20% participation), then they would be 
interested in doing a deal.  

7.  They would also entertain selling a 50% or 100% interest in these 
projects.

8.  Jay told me that KN is looking to make a steady and predictable income 
from these plants.  Thus far, his group has not made any money.  My sense is 
that they are looking for money or a story (ENA name).  I would suggest 
taking a pass at purchasing the Arkansas plant (to get their attention and 
see their project information) in an effort to get involved in the 7FA and 
ECAR projects.  If KN does have a long-term tolling agreement, then would 
should be able to lay off a large portion of the financial risk associated 
with the Arkansas transaction.  We could also look at applying Don's 
structure to the Arkansas transaction.  Needless to say, the 7FAs slots, if 
real, would allow ENA to do something strategic in Florida and Iowa. ",Jay Hopper Jay Kinder Don,,KN Energy MW O&M KN ENA ECAR

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS 

Enron Global Markets - Coal and Emissions Trading 
The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EnronOnline as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of bringing synfuel on EnronOnline is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread.  

The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal.  

Enron Energy and Operational Services - ENA Solid Fuel Initiative 
ENA started development of a Coal Initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide Enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections.  Because of the culture shock associated the use of the words  'Enron' and 'coal' in the same sentence, consideration was been given to changing the name to DNG (Dense Natural Gas); however, we went with Solid Fuel Initiative.

This initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ENA feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit.  The primary areas are Texas, Florida, southeastern Ohio and the central Rocky Mountain Area.  There are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued:  Brownsville, TX and Brighton FL.  In Brownsville, the Team secured formal Owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the Brownsville Ship Channel.  This approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay.

A 500 MW facility is being considered for Brownsville.  As conceptualized, it will consist of two - 250 MW (net) CFB units (Circulating Fluidized Bed) Boilers. The boilers will be fired by petroleum coke (petcoke) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible.  One of the advantages of locating this facility near Brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity.  There is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity.  As stated the plant is initially 500 MW, but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 MW facility.

The EEOS team is starting to grow and currently includes Hilda Akin & Cheryl Kent, Project Admin Assistants, Bill Fox as PEM, and Paula Solomon as PCM.  As the project develops there will be more team members required.  In addition, as the Florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team.   

eSource 
eSource, Enron's research group, recently posted on its website a Forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies.  These reports are free and available to all Enron employees on the eSource Hot Topics page at http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp <http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp>.  To date, over 1,600 employees have downloaded ""Spending Wisely on Private Hubs"", a report valued at $2,000.  Over 1,100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports, provided by Investext.  The reports, which are updated continuously, are presented in folders by company and industry.  New folders are being added upon request.  To submit a suggestion for a new folder, please complete the suggestion form at http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp <http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp>.  

Watch for the new eSource bulletin, The Source.  It will feature frequently requested searches, tips on finding information, new products, services, and events.

Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's information needs, eSource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to Enron employees.  

Enron Freight Markets 
EFM signed a firm contract with Streamline Shippers Association last week to provide truckload capacity for one-year with EFM's option to extend the contract for up to an additional year.  Streamline transloads international shipments that enter the U.S. through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  Streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country.  EFM will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week.

Sara, I stopped by your office to discuss ECI but you are in a meeting.  

As per our discussion yesterday, I had a scheduled conference call with Anna 
Meytina of Bear Stearns to discuss ECI.  (Sara, the call was not at 1:30 but 
rather took place before noon today).   In light of our calls with Anna, here 
is where we stand:

1. Brokerage Agreement: I asked her how we are doing on getting the final 
draft of the Agreement to me.  She indicated that she was trying to send a 
redlined version today as promised.  She still has get approval on the 
arbitration provision and limited liability provision from her Managing 
Director.  this is what is manily holding up the process, not any lack of 
diligence on our part.

2.  Assignment: Anna and I discussed my comments to the Assignment Agreement 
-- she agreed to make all of the changes and to do so by the end of the day.  

3.  Guaranty: Anna and I have a scheduled conference call to discuss my 
comments to the redlined guaranty she sent back to me.

Anna represented that, in light of the hold-up from her Managing Director, it 
was unlikely that she could get any agreement signed by the end of the day 
today but agreed that Wednesday was a realistic possibility.

formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.

2227,"Greetings everyone,

I thought it would be useful to send you this email as a follow up to the 
meeting we had last week with the IPPNY PR Working Group.  

Background
As you know our efforts to form a PR campaign as the Empire State Energy 
Suppliers fell apart at the end of May.  Since then, I have been working with 
Sharon Stewart at Brown Olson and Wilson in order to pay SSK for their 
services from April 1, 2001 to May 31, 2001.  We are waiting for one last 
invoice (May expenses) from SSK.  Once we receive this invoice, Brown Olson & 
Wilson will send a lump-sum payment to SSK.  I will get you the total cost of 
SSK's services for April/May but $200,000 is an approximate number.  This 
comes to about $22,000 per each of the 9 companies that participated in the 
effort.  As you will recall, we each sent $25K to the Escrow account.  

IPPNY PR Working Group
Given the high profile of energy issues in NY, and the increasing dialogue 
taking place there a coordinated PR effoert can certainly be justified.  
Those of us who participated in ESES, whose companies are also members of 
IPPNY, met last week in Albany to discuss whether IPPNY would be willing to 
expand their PR efforts if we joined forces.  (Thanks to all of you who were 
able to attend and participate in the meeting).  Since last week - Gavin 
Donohue, and the IPPNY Board of Directors, have given their full support to 
this expanded effort, and we are moving foward with a comprehensive 
NY-focused communications effort.  

I am working as liaison between IPPNY and SSK, and the following is a summary 
of how we are proceeding.  A meeting between SSK and Gavin and myself is 
scheduled to take place in NYC next week.  We intend to cover the following:  
We are targeting July 4th as our launch date
A press release will go out explaining IPPNY's 7-point Energy Solutions 
Program (ESP) for New York
A Q&A, Fact Sheet and other supporting documents for a press kit will be 
reviewed
We will discuss the scheduling of meetings with press outlets and third-party 
allies
We will also go over website issues, and other elements of the comprehensive 
plan

Essentially, the SSK comprehensive PR plan has been tweaked for IPPNY's 
purposes and will be implemented going foward.  Given our late start, SSK and 
IPPNY have been working extremely closely on all of the above-mentioned 
documents so that we can meet a July 4th launch date.  However, I don't want 
anyone to be out of the loop.  It is our intention to provide all of the 
members of the IPPNY PR Working Group with the documents prior to launching 
on July 4th.  The messages are in line with what we agreed to all along as 
part of ESES.  The difference is that we actually have a spokesperson - Gavin 
Donohue.  

Budget Issues
This is an extremely important issue and I am appealing to each of you to 
respond to me asap regarding the following.  As ESES, we agreed to put forth 
$50K to our PR effort - with the first $25K going into the Escrow Account 
managed by Brown Olson & Wilson.  Once SSK is paid for April/May services 
there will be some extra money in the Escrow Account.  I would like to 
proceed as follows - with your approval.

Coordinate with Brown Olson & Wilson and pay SSK for April/May services with 
Escrow Account funds
Wire the remaining Escrow Account funds to IPPNY's PR Working Group Account - 
also to be coordinated with Peter Brown (if the Escrow Agreement allows), and 
with your approval.
Work with IPPNY and have them invoice each of us for the additional $25K 
(assuming we are all still in for the original $50K).
Remaining Escrow Account funds + $25K will go toward SSK services going 
foward.  These funds in addition to the funds that IPPNY has already received 
from their PR Working Group members shall cover SSK's work beginning on June 
1, 2001 through the extend of the contract.  
Additional costs - such as advertising - will have to be considered after we 
get the funds deposited into the PR Account and have an idea of how much 
we're working with and whether advertising is a possibility.  
Enron is willing to contribute additional funds (on top of the $50K) to this 
effort if necessary.  You and your respective organizations may want to 
consider this as well. 

IPPNY/SSK Contract Issues
As you may recall, a contract between ESES and SSK was never signed.  
Contract discussions took almost 3 months, and SSK continues to work with us 
in good faith (considering they still have not been paid a dime).  Gavin is 
unwilling to sign a contract with SSK until he has funds in the PR Account to 
pay for SSK's services.  As you can see, we must expedite payment to IPPNY so 
that we can launch on July 4th and so that IPPNY and SSK can agree on 
contract terms within the next two weeks.  
Gavin is reviewing the ESES/SSK contract with IPPNY's lawyers 
Once the funds are deposited into the IPPNY PR Account, Gavin will sign a 
contract with SSK
We will provide everyone with a copy of the contract if you choose to review 
it (although most of you should be familiar with it). 

I think this covers the progress we've made since our meeting in Albany.  
Please call me if you have any questions about the budget, contract or the 
comprehensive plan.  I'm interested in you're input so please weigh in with 
your comments.  Lastly, I want to emphasize that I need your feedback 
regarding budget issues asap.  I am in Houston all week and can be reached at

2228,"Below are filings that EPMI and EES will make next week.  Once granted by 
FERC, they will allow EPMI and EES to perform some regulatory filings and 
functions on behalf of the industrials.  An industrial selling into the grid 
will still be considered a ""licensed power marketer"", but we can handle many 
of the tasks, thus making it easier for them to sell to Enron, rather than 
another power marketer that has not filed this application at FERC.

I talked to Kevin about this last night, and we discussed the fact that this 
FERC authorization WILL NOT allow the industrial to circumvent its host 
utility tariff.  Therefore, if the industrial is restricted from selling 
power from its on-site generator to the grid by the host tariff, FERC will 
not override that.  (FERC made that clear in the initial 'InPower"" filing in 
response to a request from JEA.)  For example, several years ago at Jim 
Fallon's request, we checked the HLP tariff and found that it restricted EPMI 
from selling power to the grid from the generators in the Enron building 
basement.

While Kevin thinks that this can be a valuable filing, he is concerned that 
many utility sales tariffs restrict power sales to the grid from on-site 
generators.  In addition, Mark Dobler and John Berger are working at EES on 
distributed generation solutions and could be restricted from the optionality 
that grid sales provide vs. use of distributed generation on site.  

It seems that we may want to focus some state resources on making sure that 
the utility tariffs, especially in open access retail states, provide for 
maximum flexibility for industrial customers.  

Let me know if you would like me to visit with Mark Dobler about this or 
provide other assistance.  Thanks.  Christi

A former colleague who worked for me as a trainee when I was in the

(I think) turned it down because she always wanted to work in the West.  She 
is Estonian and speaks Russian, Finnish (?), French and German, and her

As you know, Wyden wants to introduce legislation to facilitate disclosure of

details.  Wyden is not interested in pressing for additional disclosure of 
financial information.
The additional details they are looking for include: what information should 
be made available; when should it be made available, how should it be made 
available and who should make it available.  On this last point, I suggested 
that the legislation should apply to the transmission system operator, 
whoever that is (i.e. it could be an investor owned utility, a publicly-owned 
utility, an ISO or an RTO).  I also pointed out that FERC could make this 
happen by itself, except in the case of public utilities like BPA.  Extending 
FERC jurisdiction to these entities could be among the main benefits of the

2238,"All--here's some thoughts on our work with the Governors going forward thru 
the next 3 to 6 months.  Although Paul and I have talked about picking 4 or 5 
specific issues or solutions to focus on, I am a bit concerned that we will 
not be able to get them to focus on more than 1 or 2.  We also have to give 
them some constituent cover, and the other overriding concern is that the 
Republicans will generally only support what Cheney/Bush support.  The 
Republican governors are clearly looking at the WGA as a vehicle to ""cover"" 
their interests as well as an entity to come up with a solution for new and 
improved transmission systems.  

Here's a few strategies we've been talking about in addition to what we're 
doing at the WGA transmission workshop meetings:


 1.  Convince the Governors that they need to send a strong message to all 
stakeholders that they expect RTO west to have met identified goals and 
guidelines by a certain date and be up and running by a date  beyond that.  
We would need to come up with that timeline in very short order, as the best 
shot we would have in getting those dates in the public domain on record 
would be thru the energy resolutions that will be passed at the WGA annual 
conference in August.  This would be a long shot because of all of the 
incumbent interests.  However, if we could get a VERY simple message on this 
goal we might have a shot.  


 2. Educate/mobilize the Governors to petition FERC to make sure that the 
refund settlement mania doesn't extend outside sales in California. Paul can 
talk about this a little more in depth tomorrow",Paul Cheney Bush,,WGA FERC

2245,"Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to 
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond 
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt 
from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from 
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services 
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it 
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but 
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by 
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying 
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only 
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from 
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took 
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the 
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree 
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create 
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include 
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what 
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with 
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it 
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to 
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short 
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby 
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity 
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to 
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches 
to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct 
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that 
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if 
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and 
passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

2246,"California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and Assemblymember Barbara  Matthews 
(D-Tracy/Stockton area), held a press conference today to ""introduce""  two 
new ""whistleblowers"" from Duke Energy's South Bay plant.? Bustamante  and 
Matthews have filed a class action suit against out of state energy  
companies.
?
The two employees, E. Robert Edwards (who spent 22 years at  the plant as an 
electrician) and Richard J. Connors (21 years, started as a  laborer and rose 
to auxillary operator), said they had little new to offer but  were there to 
back up the testimony of the three former plant employees who  testified 
before Sen. Dunn's committee.? Among their claims were that the  plant did 
not run at its potential capacity during periods of rolling blackouts,  that 
part supplies were reduced or removed to slow maintenance, and even that  the 
emphasis on safety was reduced.? 
?
Edwards said that?the?225 MW Unit 4 was kept offline  during a period of 
rolling blackouts.? He also said that Units 1 and 2 were  run at 100 MW 
instead of their 150 MW capacity.
?
Connors noted that units were taken offline on weekends, and  that employees 
""dreaded"" Sunday night-Monday morning shifts because ""they would  have to run 
around"" to bring units on line.? A Duke spokesman said after  the press 
conference that they do shut down some of the units on weekends  because the 
state doesn't need the power and the cost of production is higher  than the 
market price.
?
The employees also claimed that one turbine which uses liquid  fuel was used 
more than they ever remember in place of steam turbines.?  Connors said the 
15 MW generated through the use of jet fuel, oil, etc. could  have easily 
been produced by making adjustments to one of the operating steam  turbines.
?
Ray Boucher, the attorney on the case, said the alleged  actions could 
violate anti-trust laws.? He claimed that documents say Duke  bought the 
South Bay plant because they knew it would enable them to exercise  market 
power.
?
Bustamante dismissed the ISO's confirmation that it had  ordered the plant 
to?ramp?up and down during Jan. 16-18, the period  discussed by the three 
previous whistleblowers.? He said that Duke's  withholding of electricity and 
bidding practices had affected how the ISO had  been forced to manage power, 
and that it is essential to examine bidding records  during that period.
?
Boucher said even though the state is looking at $9 billion in  alleged 
overcharges, the class action suit could ask for more.? ""I think it  goes 
deeper than that (the $9 billion),"" he said.
?
Bustamante made two incorrect statements during the press  conference.? He 
tried to bolster the credibility of Connors and Edwards by  saying that they 
had been kept on the job for two years after the plant's  takeover by Duke, 
which shows their value.? He was reminded that AB 1890  required keeping 
existing employees for?two years.? (Connors said he  was offered employment 
by Duke but turned them down; Edwards indicated he took  an enhanced 
severance package.)
?
The second was in regard to a claim by one of the former  employees that he 
had been told that the spare parts supply had been reduced in  order to lower 
""inventory taxes.""? Bustamante made the comment, ""We don't  have an inventory 
tax.""? It's true that California no longer taxes  inventory (in retail 
stores, for example), but counties do charge an ad valorem  tax on on-site 
business property.
?
I sat a couple of seats away from Tom Williarms, spokesman for  Duke, 
who?made under-the-breath comments?through most of the press  conference such 
as ""That's so wrong.""? Following the press conference, he  held an 
availability in the hallway.? He said that there was a fundamental  
difference in operation the employees didn't understand:? The South Bay  
plant now serves the ISO market, while it used to serve a targeted southern  
California market under SDG&E.? Williams also claimed the plant was  under 
severe environmental constraints for NOx that limited its available run  time.
?
Duke, he added, did not want to charge the high prices -- over  $3,000/MWh 
--?it did but included an 80% credit premium because the  utilities were not 
creditworthy.??To date, he said,?it has only  received 1.8 cents on the 
dollar.??Williams said Duke?tried to  sell the power to DWR instead at a much 
lower?rate, but was  refused.?Duke has since refunded some money, Williams  
said,?and?has offered to re-bill at FERC's price-mitigation  rate.","Cruz Bustamante Assemblymember Barbara   Bustamante   Matthews E. Robert Edwards Richard J. Connors Dunn Edwards Ray Boucher Duke   Bustamante Duke Connors Tom Williarms Williams Williams

2248,"Public Hearing on Revised Energy Law (EnWG Novelle)
- the German Parliment voted for a open hearing in conjunction with 
deliberations over the revision to the Energy Law. We had
been pushing hard for such a hearing so as to be able to get EFET and other 
like-minded associations to voice our
concerns about the lack of real market opening in the gas and power markets. 
The hearing is now scheduled for th 24th
of Sept and I will probably speak on behalf of EFET Germany.

Possible Application of Article 86 by EU Commission to Force Greater/More 
Rapid Market Opening
- Tensions between Germany and the EU on lack of  implementation of the Gas 
Directive and German instransigence on
regulated TPA and cross-border issues continues to build. Indeed, the 
atmosphere is quite tense now and it seems likely
that the EU will no employ the ""nuclear option"" of Article 86 to force 
greater and more rapid market opening in member
states. (Peter can add to this)

Gas VV Negotiations Difficult: German Cartel Office Sends Highly Critical 
Letter to Associations
- The negotiations of amendments to the German Gas network agreement continue 
to move at a snail's pace.Key issues
that we have argued for (cost-based tarriffs, development of standard 
transport and storage contracts, replacement of 
point-to-point tariff model with an exit/entry system) have yet to be 
addressed -largely because the gas industry is
wholly opposed to making these part of the negotiations. The negotiating 
associations to the network agreement (so-called 
VV-Gas) have been criticized in a letter from the head of the German Cartel 
Office. He concludes that there efforts have
not produced a basis for gas competition in Germany and that if significant 
progress is not made in the next few months, 
the Cartel Office does not see how Germany can continue to defend the model 
of negotiated access and may have
to accept a regulated solution.

Negotiation Begin for Access to Baltic Cable
After many months of correspondence and insistence by Philip Davies that 
Baltic Cable provide us with terms for
TPA, the new managment of Baltic Cable has agreed to meet with us to 
negotiate access. Negotiations will begin
with Eon (now manager of Baltic) on the 11th.

OMV/Tag Finco
Some weeks ago we initiated a formal proceeding against the Austrian pipeline 
company for effective denial of access
to their long-distance pipe running to Italy. After several hours of 
hearings, the Ministry accepted Enron's complaint and 
rejected OMV's petition to withdraw the complaint. The Ministry provided 
clear indications to OMV that they would
prefer a negotiated settlement but were ready to proceed with a full-scale 
investigation if necessary. The pressure
was sufficient to bring OMV to the table and we are now in the process of 
trying to reach closure of firm capacity
through Austria and into Italy.Should we fail to conclude agreement by July 
15th, the case against OMV will
resume.

In a rehearing order issued yesterday in the complaint proceeding on El 
Paso's capacity allocation methodology at Topock, FERC required SoCal Gas to 
share the capacity it was allocated at the SoCal/Topock interconnection on a 
pro rata basis with the replacement shippers to whom it has released capacity 
unless otherwise provided in the release.  ENA currently has about 60,000 
MMBtu/d of released Topock capacity that it acquired from SoCal Gas.  

The initial order in this proceeding required El Paso to reallocate capacity 
among the four interconnects (SoCal, PG&E, Mojave, and Southwest Gas)  that 
make up the Topock delivery point.  El Paso's previous policy aggregated the 
four interconnects for the purpose of contracting for firm deliveries.  
Shippers thus had contractual firm rights to deliver about 1,555 MMcf/d to 
SoCal/Topock, but the physical capacity of the interconnect is only 540 
MMcf/d.  Because the best market prices are at the SoCal/Topock point, 
shippers nominate their full entitlements to SoCal/Topock, resulting in 
continual cuts and uncertainty in the marketplace.  

In compliance with the initial order, each firm shipper made a one-time 
election of the specific Topock point that it desired as a primary delivery 
point.  Not surprisingly, all selected SoCal/Topock, and El Paso then 
allocated primary rights on a pro rata basis.  SoCal Gas was allocated 
489,822 Mcf/d at all the Topock points, but only 202,218 Mcf/d at 
SoCal/Topock.  SoCal Gas then advised ENA and other replacement shippers that 
their capacity would be designated for primary delivery at the Mojave/Topock 
point.  ENA's capacity therefore became significantly less valuable.  

ENA protested El Paso's report to FERC on the allocation process in which it 
provided for the releasing shippers to designate the delivery point 
entitlements of their replacement shippers.  Cook Inlet also requested 
rehearing of the initial order, and  Duke Energy Trading and Marketing filed 
in support of ENA and Cook Inlet.  FERC's order yesterday means that ENA will 
get primary delivery rights at SoCal/Topock for at least a pro rata portion 
of its released capacity.

The revised allocations will be effective April 1, 2001.

Opportunity:

The order also requires El Paso to file, within 30 days, in its Order 637 
proceeding a proposal addressing systemwide capacity allocation issues, 
presumably assigning specific mainline and delivery point capacity rights and 
possible pathing of the entire system.  Parties to the Order 637 proceeding 
will then have 20 days to file comments.

This gives us the opportunity to address the EES problem in Arizona involving 
deliveries (or lack thereof) to customers behind Southwest Gas.",Cook Inlet,,"El

Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure 
July 6, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of 
worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by 
Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said 
Thursday. 
Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, 
compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. 
Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another 
increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely 
would require some future increase. 
The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed 
prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a 
few months to 20 years. 
The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the 
fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts 
would decline over time. 
Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. 
""You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, 
long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably 
either average could be defended mathematically,"" said Nettie Hoge of The 
Utility Reform Network. ""We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the 
contracts are very convoluted and complex.""

Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of 
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power 
crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share 
of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of 
California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private 
energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the 
state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting 
to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting 
against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and 
simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most 
of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying 
the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators 
who have also gouged California. 
""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across 
their face because they are robbing us blind,"" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state 
Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from 
Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are 
made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually 
used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most 
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and 
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped 
as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events 
that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover 
from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in 
receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, 
an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents 
subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged 
market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, 
received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged 
higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 
million.

2259,"Here is the Murkowski energy bill that was introduced this morning, along 
with a section-by-section summary.
",Murkowski,,
2260,"FYI.

",,,FYI
2261,"Please forward to others who need this information.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small 
customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal 
that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the 
MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  
The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not 
yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting 
attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is 
attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on 
the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by 
customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the 
generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, 
investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts 
and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the 
bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong 
possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX 
labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to 
include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate 
has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds 
to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. 
AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a ""modified MOU.""  
Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their ""modified"" 
MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an ""informational"" hearing on the bill tomorrow 
(Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, 
with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on 
Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, 
July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get 
resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional 
comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie 
Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in 
Sacramento.

2262,"I have forwarded separately GA top 10 goals for EES.  While there will be 
need for refinement and additional discussion, I would like to see us start 
now to develop strategies for these goals.  Below I've suggested people in 
our organization who could serve as ""issue leaders""  who could take on the 
task of more fully defining the goal, developing the strategy, and developing 
the metric by which performance is measured.  I would work with these people 
and do whatever necessary to coordinate, direct, etc. 

Are you ok with this approach and with the designated leads?  (Suggested 
leads are shown on the last page)  I think many of these goals are also good 
categories to state previous results.



For example, one of the goals we should move on quickly (which you have 
mentioned to me) and which is listed as #10 is the ""improve communication"".  
We could do this initially through the monthly newsletter and perhaps a 
client survey which measures EES Mgmt.'s satisfaction with GA.  I would think 
and like if someone with some PR pizazz could take these and run with them.  
The newsletter should look professional and, I think, be a joint publication 
with EES (which I've talked to Peggy Mahoney about). It would be great if the 
first edition could be out in a couple ow weeks.

All of the other goals pretty much have a similar story - some immediate need 
which needs a lot of attention.  I think we would be most effective enlisting 
the right people to champion each of these.",Peggy Mahoney,,GA EES EES Mgmt

2266,"The Texas statute allows for full collection of stranded costs with a final 
determination of stranded costs in 2004 and interim collection in 2002 and 
2003 based on a Commission estimate.  The Commission bases its estimate of 
stranded costs on the ECOM (Excess Costs Over Market) Model.  The ECOM model 
computes the difference between the revenues a utility would receive in a 
regulated environment versus the revenues a utility would receive if it sold 
all of its generation at market prices (the market price in the ECOM Model is 
based on a Combined Cycle Combustion Turbine). 

In 1998 the Commission estimated more than $4 Billion in stranded costs based 
on the ECOM Model.  Because stranded costs are the difference between the 
market value and the book value of utility generating assets, the Commission 
ordered utilities to ""mitigate"" stranded costs by increasing depreciation of 
generating assets.  The accelerated depreciation, came from two sources:

 1. Redirected depreciation -- Utilities were allowed to defer depreciation 
of their wires assets and increase depreciation on generating assets; and,
 2. Application of Excess Earnings -- instead of decreasing utility rates the 
Commission set a cap on earnings and directed the utilities to apply any 
earnings above the cap to depreciating generating assets.

Because of the unexpected rise in natural gas prices the market price in the 
ECOM model rose significantly above the weighted average price of the 
regulated side which is weighted by coal and nuclear.  This caused the 2001 
estimate of stranded costs to be severely negative.  Even more negative than 
the amounts of redirected depreciation and application of excess earnings.

Enron argued at the Commission that because the estimate of stranded cost was 
negative the accelerated depreciation was unnecessary.  Consequently, we 
argued that the money spent on mitigation should be used to reduce wires 
rates.  The utilities argued that they should keep mitigation until the final 
determination of stranded costs in 2004.  The Commission ruled in Enron's 
favor.  

Sylvester Turner filed H.B. 2107 to address this situation, however, rather 
than simply reducing wires charges, the bill as filed would reduce utility 
rates making it more difficult to compete.  We are working to amend the bill 
so that the credit for redirected depreciation and excess earnings goes only 
to reducing wires rates and that any negative stranded costs beyond that 
amount would be refunded directly to ratepayers.",Sylvester Turner,more than $4 Billion,"Commission ECOM Utilities the

the Administration's National Energy Policy.  During the discussion, Ken 
raised the importance of including LNG in its policy.  Ken emphasized that 
any national energy policy should encourage investment in infrastructure for 
natural gas and power, and said that at current gas prices in the US LNG 
imports are financially attractive.  Ken said that Enron is making a 
significant investment in global LNG business and much of this investment 
will be in the US and South America.  The Vice President, while not affirming 
our position, seem very receptive to the message.  As we were departing the 
White House, Ken saw Secretary Colin Powell.  Ken spoke to the Secretary

2269,"The PUCT ruled today that the utilities' excess earnings balance will be 
credited to the wires...amortized over 7 years with 7.5% interest beginning 
Jan 1, 2002.  (Trueup was not until 2004).  Utilities are unhappy however, 
this is the direction the commission had indicated they were heading a few 
weeks ago.  The excess earnings total over $6 billion dollars (new numbers 
came out today).  

I visited with Rep. Turner today after the commission's ruling, AECT set up a 
meeting with him to cut a deal.  Our commitment with Turner is that he will 
not harm the headroom created in SB 7 and subsequent PUCT decisions.  Turner 
was not completely happy with the commission's order because he was hoping 
for a larger refund check to rate payers.  Our amendment to HB 2107 (which 
refunds the excess earnings to the wires) is in line with the commission's 
decision.  When we signed on board with Turner, he said that if we stood with 
him, he would protect our interest.  Thank you for letting us get on board 
with him.  The IOUs are trying to cut a deal with him and because we stood 
with him...our interest should come first (as he has stated). 

During the HB 2107 committee hearing in March, Baker (TXU)  indicated that 
excess earnings should be returned to the wires (in 2004 trueup).  (I am 
getting the transcript of that hearing in the morning to confirm my memory).  

In a hearing on Nov 8, 2000 at the PUCT, Shaeffer ( Reliant) testified ""We 
believe that if we overrecover stranded investment, that we're going to 
refund the dollars down to the book value"".  Of course he meant during the 
2004 trueup, however, with the overcollection reaching $6 billion - and with 
today's commission ruling - a refund of the overcollection before 2004 is 
inevitable.  

Chairman Wolens (off the record) indicated today that HB 2107 would go to 
conference.  I think it is safe to infer he thinks the bill will pass the 
House and move to the Senate.  Turner has worked the Black Caucus, Hispanic 
Caucus and the Democratic Caucus.  

Rep. Counts (West Texas Conservative D) stood with Turner at the press 
conference along with Rep. Bailey and Rep. Hodge...each of them advocated for 
a refund of the overcollection.  (At the press conference Turner stated that 
he would drop his bill and wait until the 2004 trueup if the utilities would 
agree to keep everyone's lights on until the 2004 trueup.) The bill is likely 
to be heard on the House floor next Tuesday.

I did not provide comments/quotes to Fort Worth Star Telegram...they were 
told I was at the Capitol at a hearing.  I am working on a formal statement 
and gathering the support of other market participants with our interest to 
sign on.  I will run that by you before anything goes out. 

Thus far, Enron, Calpine, New Energy, Strategic,  and Excelon are willing to 
publically support our amendment to HB 2107.  (Others are supporting it but 
won't come out of the closet because they fear the utilities.) We are talking 
to Shell on Friday.  (They got confused and are supporting the bill as 
filed...which hurts headroom...they like our amendment but want to talk 
Friday before supporting it.)

Last week President Fox invited Jaime Alatorre to his trip to Canada.  At 
some point they discussed energy reform and the need to bring in the private 
sector into the discussion to make sure that the new regulation was 
attractive to investors.

After that conversation President Fox asked Jaime Alatorre to head an effort 
to build consensus in the private sector with respect to energy reform.  He 
met today with Secretary Martens for 90 minutes to discuss strategy and 
implementation.

I am meeting this afternoon with Marten's Chief of Staff,  Mauricio Camps to 
give him materials and to discuss the main issues of the private sector and 
of the energy companies.

I think it will be very important to be very close to Jaime on this in order 
to be able to give him the necessary technical and strategic support that he 
will be needing during this process.  

Probably a way to do it is to congratulate him and to offer help.  We would 
then have to make sure that any of you have a periodical call with him for 
the group to have adequate information on the process and also to be able to 
identify areas of opportunity that will surely appear.

that you want me to have on this.

Do we think the language empowers NERC with too much authority?  Or does it 
allow for any organization, i.e. GISB/EISB to perform the functions.

I know Enron agrees with NERC not imposing restrictions on the RTOs and slow

need to know what some of the words and phrases are meant to indicate. The

the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Here is a summary of the work of this task force.  Bill Rust has been 
attending  the meetings and I have been closley coordinating our positions.

The PFTF set out to develop a means to capture native load impacts (not 
tagged) in load flow models to ensure that parallel flows resulting from 
native load dispatch are accounted for accurately to assess system security.  
This has largely been ignored in the past since most TLRs hit only non-firm 
PTP transactions.  However, the NERC TLR procedures (in line with FERC OATT) 
requires a pro-rata curtailment of native and network service with Firm 
point-to-point (PTP).  Since more and more TLRs at Level 5 (Firm) have been 
utilized and is expected to rise, providers are being forced by the MIC to 
demonstrate comparability at these TLR levels.  In order to demonstrate 
comparability - a transparent calculation of Native and Network impacts is 
needed.  In past, this was left to the discretion of each control area. 

The task force reviewed 7 methods on how to model native gen to native load 
dispatch.  

These seven methods can be grouped into three categories:
1) Continue with the existing method that does not consider counterflows.
2) Inlcude counterflows for NNL (Native/Network Load) and PTP and assign to 
sink control area.
3) Assign NNL counterflows to the control area and PTP counterflows to the 
purchasing selling entitiy (PSE). 

Each method tries to simulate real-time dispatch realizing that an 
interconnection-wide state estimator is not available nor a nodal dispatch 
model.
 
The simplest methods (group 1) adjust each generator individually to a set of 
load points in its control area and repeats until all the units in the 
control area are accounted for.   The problem for the transmission owners 
with this approach is that the netting effects of the real-time dispatch are 
not captured therfore exaggerating the impacts a control area has on its 
neighbors. Group 1 solutions were rejected because the task force beleived 
that its parent, the Security Subcommittee (Dick Ingersoll member) insisted 
on a new procedure that included counterflows - for security reasons.

The initial proposal to include netted effects (Group 2) allows control areas 
to net NNL flows within the control area and PTP to net flows that are 
grouped by sink control area. Group 2 solutions were rejected because PSEs 
would not get credit for off-setting transactions that sink in other control 
areas, e.g. I have a PTP that sinks in TVA that off-sets a PTP that sinks in 
SOCO. Group 2 solutions would not give credit for this.

The most complex method (group 3) allows the native load dispatch to net 
their impacts with all internal gen-load pairings AND nets the contributions 
of point-to-point tagged transactions by PSE.  This is the most equitable 
solution for the market, however it is the most costly and demanding solution 
for the transmission owner/operators. Group 3 solutions were acceptable to 
all parties because it assigned credit to those who are sponsoring 
transactions that relieve the flow gate loading.

Lately, I have been pushed in NERC activities to make calls that boil down to 
what is fair and equitable between native loads and point-to-point service 
vs. what increased burden and accountability on providers is needed to 
provide for that level of comparability.

We should always hold providers to the higher standard.  That is - it is not 
easy to facilitate market transactions, and yes - real people and real 
dollars are needed to be expended by providers to continue facilitating an 
increasingly complex and evolving marketplace.  Providers cannot be let off 
the hook and be allowed to do what is easy and least cost - this has proven 
over and over to have negative impact on the market.",Kevin Bill Rust Inlcude counterflows NNL counterflows Dick Ingersoll,,NERC FERC PTP MIC TLR Native and Network NNL the Security Subcommittee TVA PSE

2283,"Today, FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are 
necessary to promote further market liquidity.  The conference was fairly 
well attended by FERC staff, including Dan Larcamp and  Shelton Cannon.  

Some common themes:
Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not 
necessary.
Commodity markets are very liquid.
FERC policies, GISB and Order 637 have helped to make capacity markets more 
liquid.
Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in 
Order No. 637 compliance filings.
Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity (with pipelines making the 
distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea, 
standardization of product offerings is not).
There is very little consensus on further areas for change.  In nearly every 
case, a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another.  
In any event, most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes.

Areas without consensus:
Shipper-must-have-title rule.  LDCs argue it should be removed; while Process 
Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release 
market.
Production area rate design.  LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy 
service downstrream of a market pool.  Reliant and Koch also argued that 
pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates.  
The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area.
SFV.  East Coast LDCs, Michcon, and APGA argued for moving off of SFV.  The 
producers and industrials oppose.  Illinois Power/Dynegy also argued for 
moving off SFV.  


LDC Positions
The LDCs main themes were removing the shipper-must-have-title and enabling 
LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers.  However, they also argued 
that  pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric 
generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically 
enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs .   This is the point that AGA 
raised in the blanket intervention to all Order 637 compliance filings.    
Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are 
entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a 
best efforts basis, perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not 
have been fully subscribed.  LDCs, generally stating that 637 compliance 
filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation, continued to stress 
the need for segmentation, including ""geographical segmentation of ROFR 
capacity.""  

Some Specific Proposals
NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form 2 filings.  
A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information, 
though specific needs were not well defined.
Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties 
(especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for 
arbitrage).
Alliance of Energy Suppliers (marketing arm of EEI) called for a dialogue 
between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly 
variability.  They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to 
match the power grid (Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to 
standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well).
The GISB End-User group (represented by Salt River Project)  complained about 
the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas 
transactions to be ""tagged"" like electric transactions.  

E-Commerce and Capacity Trading
Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity 
trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy 
transactions, remove posting periods and long contract execution periods.  He 
made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary.  
Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme, admonishing the 
FERC not to micro-manage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist 
on a single platform.  He said that liquidity cannot be legislated.  From his 
perspective, natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets 
in the world.  FERC should worry about transferring the ""good stuff"" from 
natural gas to electric markets, not the reverse.",Dan Larcamp Shelton Cannon Koch Carl Levander Dave Neubaurer Robert Levin,,"FERC Staff FERC GISB APGA SFV Illinois Power/Dynegy AGA Columbia ROFR

	The Government Affairs group is involved in diverse and complex activities.  Tracking and quantifying these activities is important for several obvious reasons - to keep upper management apprised of our activities; to illustrate the value added and risk managed by our group; and to keep each other properly  informed so that we can better coordinate our efforts.

	Currently, these activities take place on an ad-hoc manual basis, which is time-consuming and inefficient.  We have a tool already in place to track our activities - the Project Tracking database in Lotus Notes.  Currently this application is used primarily for RCR's, but beginning November 1, 2001, the Government Affairs group will use this application to track all projects and efforts  - replacing the need for manual updated spreadsheets and activity quantification ""fire-drills"".  The Projects have several features to allow capture of sub-sets of information, including Updates, Risk, Origination and Valuation.

	**  Please note that this will become the only way that we'll gather this information.  In other words, if you don't enter your data into Project Tracking, we won't know what you're doing! **( all other reports will be eliminated)

	The current Lotus Notes application will be discontinued as of October 31,2001 and will be converted to a web-based product.  You'll find the web-based version as easy or even easier to use than Lotus Notes.  Additionally, conversion to a new database structure will allow for more versatile report extraction.

	Before the conversion of the project data from Lotus Notes to Oracle, we need to do some data cleanup.  Please expect a call in the next two weeks from Elizabeth Linnell, Bryan Gottfredson, or Darran Binns to schedule some time with you in person or on the phone regarding your current project list, additional projects to add, and a brief overview of the new system.

			Good Tuesday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

If the market has indeed put in a bottom over the last few days, be prepared
for us to 'retest' the lows. A successful test, is what is needed, followed
by a meaningful rally!
The market has already factored in most of the bad news from corporate
America. We may also see individual stocks rise after releasing bad news.
This would also prove to be very meaningful. Look to use this period to
upgrade portfolios.

Banks  Henry Chip Dickson
Impact of Recession on Bank Trends (CD)
q Many expect that the precarious U.S. slowdown may already be in or tipping
toward recession after
the recent WTC incident. Regardless of whether the U.S. economy slips into
recession, it has been
undergoing a transition from rapid growth of the 1990s to a period of slow
growth. This transition
has created a challenging operating environment for banks.
q This week we take a look at historical bank trends before, during, and
after recessions.

Banks 		Jason Goldberg
Weekly Bank Facts (JG)
q The Lehman Brothers Bank Index ended the week down 7.2%. Our Large-Cap
Bank Index fell
11.2%, while the Mid-Cap Bank Index declined 6.7%.
q All major indices also were down this week. The S&P 500 fell 11.6%. The
Dow lost 14.3% and Nasdaq
was off by 16.0% for the week.

City National		 Brock Vandervliet
On Target With an Even Better Valuation 1 - Strong Buy / 39.85 (USD)
q Although the stock is still roughly 10% above where we upgraded it to
1-Strong Buy back in March,
it has retraced most of its intervening gains. Once again, we believe it
should be front and center
in any discussion with investors in the smaller-cap financials at this time.
q We carry a Q3 EPS estimate of $0.73 for CYN, expected to report October
12. Although confident in our
estimate this is $0.02 less than consensus.
q Given CYN's mildly asset sensitive positioning, we wouldn't be surprised
by some margin decline this
quarter, similar in magnitude to Q2.
q Due to the declining runoff of the non-relationship syndicated book, we
believe CYN's above average loan
growth should be increasingly visible


Commerce Bancorp		 Brock Vandervliet
Q3 Preview and Mtg On Manhattan Rollout 2 - Buy / $65.50 (USD)
q Although sharply below its highs along with so many other stocks, CBH
trades at a six multiple
premium to the rest of the group and we are maintaining our investment
rating of 2-Buy.
q We carry a Q3 estimate of $0.77, up $0.03 from Q2. CBH should report
October 10.
q We remain pretty confident in our numbers for several reasons. First, the
NIM, which was up 16 bps in Q2
to 4.81% should push higher still. Second, and perhaps more important from
the perspective of '02, CBH
is far less dependent than most banks on incremental loan growth.

Commerce Bancshares	 Brock Vandervliet
3Q Preview 2 - Buy / 35.99 (USD)
q Based on the likelihood of continued margin compression for the balance of
the year we are
trimming our estimates for the second half of 2001. Due to valuation we rate
the shares 2 - Buy
q We believe there is a chance CBSH could better our revised 2001 estimates
due to the quasi-non-recurring
items including branch sale and student loan securitization gains. CBSH
typically sells a portfolio
of student loans twice a year depending on supply and market conditions.
q We believe CBSH continues to repurchase shares at essentially the same
pace of 450,000 shares/quarter.

First Commonwealth Fin'l	 Brock Vandervliet
FCF 3Q Preview: Watching the Margin 3 - Market Perform / $10.85 (USD)
q Save the possibility of a sharp margin decline, which we view as unlikely
from this level, or
dramatically higher credit costs, we are confident in full year estimates of
$0.84 and $0.90 which
imply 7% EPS growth. FCF is rated 3-Market Perform.
q We carry a $0.21 Q3 EPS estimate, in line with Q2 and consensus as well.
We expect FCF will report
October 18. As with Q2, this is inclusive of what may be a penny or two of
investment securities gains.
q We have been concerned for sometime in the margin dynamic as Q2's NIM of
3.44% was an all time low
after falling 11 bps in the qtr. We believe it could fall somewhat further
although balance sheet trends
appear to be reasonably positive.

First Tennessee 	Jason Goldberg
3Q01 Preview: Further Upside Doable 2 - Buy / $34.03 (USD)
q We continue to be positive on our outlook for FTN and rate the stock
2-Buy. Not only lower interest
rates, but fundamental improvements within this organization should aid
results.
q Earlier in the quarter FTN announced it expects to post 3Q01 EPS of at
least $0.62. Our forecast pencils
out to $0.63. The company should report on October 17.
q We expect results to evidence continued strength in the net interest
margin and growth in both mortgage
banking and capital markets revenues. Asset quality metrics should remain
relatively stable.


Provident Financial Group 	Jason Goldberg
3Q 01 Keeping an Eye on Asset Quality 2 - Buy / $24.90 (USD)
q ? We rate PFGI 2-Buy and expect the company to put down EPS growth rates
ahead of its peers
once current issues are put to bed. However, we believe the next few
quarters could be bumpy and
that PFGI's business model, which is heavily exposed to commercial loans, is
more susceptible to
downturns in the economy.
q We expect PFGI to report 3Q01 EPS of $0.70 on October 17. This compares to
$0.63 in the prior quarter.
q While continued loan growth and fee income expansion should lead to
double-digit revenue growth, higher
credit costs and the lack of net interest margin expansion should restrain
further improvement.


Synovus Financial 	Jason Goldberg
3Q01 Preview: Keeping an Eye on TSYS 2 - Buy / $40.78 (USD)
q We rate SNV 2 Buy. SNV should benefit from its decentralized banking
approach in the Southeast,
the build-out of its wealth management unit and the growing contribution of
Total Systems.
q We expect SNV to report 3Q01 EPS of $0.27 on October 17.
q Continued net interest margin expansion and solid loan growth should lead
the bank's results.
q We will keep a close eye on TSYS, its 80.8% card processing unit, to see
if new business related to its
European rollout is enough to offset weaker than expected volume in
mid-September. TSYS should report
on October 16.
q We expect SNV to remain one of the few banks posting an ROE in the 20.00%
area and a ROA in the
2.00% range.

Ace Limited 		J. Paul Newsome
Upgraded to 1 Buy; Estimates Lowered 1 - Strong Buy / 23.71 (USD)
q We are upgrading ACE to 1-Strong Buy from 2-Buy with a $30 per share price
target. Among the
large cap. insurers ACE's stock is one of the most inexpensive and it has
among the most upside
to better prices in the future in commercial insurance and reinsurance.
q The stock is trading at about book value under what we feel would be a
worst-case scenario (double ACE
management's projected WTC loss). Historically ACE has traded at 150% of
book value.
q Our price target assumes the company trades at roughly a 40% discount from
its historic price-to-book
value one year from now.

Allmerica Financial J. Paul Newsome
Change of Recommendation 1 - Strong Buy / 45.04 (USD)
q We are upgrading Allmerica to 1 Strong Buy from 2 Buy following the
decline in its share price after
the World Trade Center disaster. Our new price target is $54 per share, down
from $65 per share.
q Allmerica, as a relatively large regional insurer, represents one of the
better ""safe havens"" among the
insurers largely unaffected by the World Trade Center disaster-little World
Trade Center loss exposure,
little investments in equities, and strong balance sheets.
q At just 87% of projected third quarter book value ($48.14 per share), we
think Allmerica represents
compelling value.

HCC Insurance Hldgs	 J. Paul Newsome
Rating Affirmed 1 - Strong Buy / $23.95 (USD)
q We are maintaining our 1 Strong Buy rating on HCC Insurance Holdings with
a price target of $27
per share, down from $30 per share.
q HCC Insurance Holdings falls nicely into the category of commercial
insurers well poised to take
advantage of the accelerating insurance prices following the tragic World
Trade Center disaster.

Countrywide Credit	 Makiko Coakley
CCR Will Report Its 2Q Earnings Tomorrow 2 - Buy / $40.21 (USD)
q Countrywide will report its fiscal 2Q earnings (for the quarter ending
August 30) on Tuesday 9/25.
The current consensus estimate for its 2Q is $1.19. We are raising our
estimate from $1.18 to
$1.20. Due to the fact that CCR typically benefits from lower interest
rates, and that it has very
limited credit risk exposure, the stock seems to be working as a ""place to
hide."" We believe this
trend will likely continue as long as the equity market remains volatile and
depressed.
q Mortgage rates declined and refinance activities picked up in Jul. and
Aug. CCR recently reported its
August production volume, which was the highest monthly number in CCR's
history. Thus, we are raising
our 2Q EPS estimate by $0.02 to $1.20.

q Reflecting F1Q02 results and new F2002 guidance, our DCF model shows the
current $30 share
price assumes a far too pessimistic low-teens EPS growth rate over the next
five years relative to
our 19% projection and management's 25% target. We would actively put new
money to work in
this blue chip Business & Professional Services company.
q On September 20, PAYX reported F1Q02 (ended August) EPS of $0.19 up 20%
year over year and in-line
with our estimates and the Street consensus.

Adept Technology 	Edward White
Insight into Photonics Area 2 - Buy / 4.25 (USD)
q While fundamentals in all of the company's served markets are particularly
weak, we believe the
company's position in photonics assembly automation supports purchase of the
shares for long-term
risk-oriented investors.
q Recently, we attended a presentation by Adept Technology, highlighting the
company's capabilities in
photonics assembly automation. We believe the key takeaway is that the
company's strategy of designing
and developing platforms is progressing well.
q We believe a critical differentiating factor for Adept in the photonics
market is the company's software
simulation capability, which has been critical to the co's initial successes
with customers, but is not
currently appreciated by investors.

JDS Uniphase A	Arnab Chanda
Preannounces; Remain Cautious 3 - Market Perform / 5.36 (USD)
q We continue to be cautious on JDS Uniphase and would look for entry points
once carrier capex
stabilizes.
q As we expected, JDS lowered its FQ1 rev forecast to $325M (down 46% q/q)
vs our previous forecast of
$400M (down 33% q/q). Although the company is seeing early signs of
stabilization in demand, we
continue to believe that margin compression could be a bigger issue due to
pricing.
q We are reducing CY01 revs from $2,281M (down 20% y/y) to $2,155M (down 24%
y/y) and CY02 from
$1,588M (down 30% y/y) to 1,356M (down 37% y/y). We believe gross margins
will continue to decline and
are modeling 38% in FQ1 and 36% in FQ2. We are also reducing FQ1 EPS from
($0.02) to ($0.03), CY01
EPS from $0.13 to $0.11, and CY02 EPS from $0.07 to $0.02



National Semiconductor
Shareholder Mtg.-FQ2 Guidance Reaffirmed 3 - Market Perform / $22.50 (USD)
q NSM hosted a shareholder meeting on Fri., reiterating FQ2 guidance of revs
up 5-7% q/q. Although
the company made positive comments on recent order activity, NSM was
uncertain about the near-term
prospects for end demand. This view is in-line with our concerns.
q National indicated that its turns business has remained healthy through
last week. The company is seeing
relative strength particularly in wireless (25% of revs) and displays (10%
of revs). Similarly to our view,
however, NSM is uncertain about the implications for real end demand given
the weakening economy and
this month's tragic events

",Mike Bert Dunn Kate,,Amerex
2332,"I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,
Kate

2333,"Just a few comments on the Text:

You may wish to specify throughout that all time references are to ""GMT""
The examples given for the offline nominations procedures imply that 
nominations/re-nominations made by the customer are NOT effective until Enron 
has  responded affirmatively - this is not how the underlying GTC reads 
(under which such customer nominations/re-nominations become effective 
without subsequent Enron's ""confirmation"")
On the last page , I would remove the reference to a Master, since this does 
not currently apply to EnBank trades
Presumably , you are not now proceeding on the basis of a separate ATA (i.e. 
Auctions Trading Agreement governing EOL access)?

Otherwise, I am happy with the form of Text.

Thanks for your note.  Enron does have a policy that somewhat restricts the 
trading that may be done by employees - even when they are not involved in a 
trading function.  No Enron employee is permitted to trade any commodity for 
their own account (or for the account of another) which Enron trades.  The 
only general exceptions to this are for equity and debt securities - and 
there are special restrictions on persons who trade those items for Enron.  
This policy is modified from time to time by the Enron Corp. Board of 
Directors and is monitored by the Risk Assessment and Control Group.  I 
believe Cassandra Schultz currently has that responsibility.  I am sending 
her a copy of this e-mail (so in case I have misrepresented the policy in 
some way, Cassandra please correct me) and if you need any further 
information, please contact her.

TAIWAN REGULATORY CHANGE GOOD FOR FOREIGN BANKS.

with any comments or questions.

1. As I have discussed with Stephen, you should not assume that we have 
rejected any of your comments if they did not appear in the attached 
version.   Please contact me to discuss, or resend, any comments that you 
believe that we accepted but that are not reflected in this document.

2. Several new defined terms have been added.  Several definitions were 
revised to reflect that eSpeed will be posting prices to a platform operated 
by a separate legal entity that eSpeed will not necessarily control.

3. The defined terms ""Sponsor Material Adverse Effect"", ""Sponsor Regulatory 
Event"", and ""Sponsor Technological Failure"" have been renamed ""eSpeed ..."" 
instead of ""Sponsor ...""

4. Sections 3(a) and (b) have been slightly reworded to reflect the multiple 
platform concept.   Section 3(c) was moved from Section 5.  The standards for 
a party's right to suspend have been revised slightly.  Also, Section 4(d) 
includes a right by Enron to suspend prices specifically in the event of 
mapping errors; this provision also relates to the termination right in 
Section 13 with respect to mapping errors. 

5. Section 4 has been rewritten to reflect the multiple platforms.     

6. Section 5(b) has been revised to reflect that the parties should develop a 
set of ground rules for operating and maintaining the Interfaces that will 
govern the parties once they commence operations.

7. Section 6 has not been changed in any significant manner, except for 
Section 6(d) with respect to commissions

8. Section 7 has been moved (it was previously Section 9) and reflects our 
concerns that the means by which contracts are entered into with Enron are 
clearly disclosed to Participants.

9. The parity section has been revised as we discussed -- essentially, Enron 
shall use ""commercially reasonable efforts to ensure parity""  

10. The reps and warranties and covenants have not been substantively 
revised, but separate reps, warranties and covenants are made by each party 
(instead of including both parties reps/warranties/covenants in the same 
provision).

11. Section 12 is new.  We felt that the Agreement did not clearly set forth 
what would have to be done before the parties could start posting prices.

12. We have revised Section 13(a)(i) and (iii) and 13(b)(i) and (iii) 
(termination events as we discussed); 13(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) are new. 

13. Section 14 has been substantially revised, but is still confusing,  
However, the idea is that the agreement include a single provision governing 
confidentiality and that certain information that Enron is particularly 
sensitive about will be kept confidential, while other information becomes 
eSpeed's property at some point to do with as it wishes.  Any thoughts about 
clarifying Section 14 would be appreciated.

14. The Indemnity has been revised to include a separate section for each 
party ((a) and (b)), but we do not believe that the substance of the prior 
provision was changed.

15. We need to give further thought to Section 16 and the provisions that 
eSpeed provided to us (Sections 15(e), (f) and (g) in the prior draft).  
While I have discussed this with Stephen and do not object to the point that 
those provisions is trying to make, the language is a bit broad in places and 
we need to spend more time with it to make sure that it does not conflict 
with other provisions of the Agreement.

16. I have tried to reserve the right for the parties to obtain injunctive 
relief, but this section needs expansion -- and I think Stephen had some 
specific thoughts about what would not be subject to arbitration.

17. The Enron Covenant added as Exhibit H is not perfect, but it is 
essentially what we had contemplated providing.  The Schedule A listing 
Specified Products is also attached.  Therefore, the only Exhibit or Schedule 
missing is Exhibit I, which is the commission structure. 

Please feel free to call or send a message if you have any comments or 
questions regarding the atttached.

I have reviewed the existing ECTRIC, Norweigan Branch HDD Swap GTC's.  In 
contrast to the Financial GTC's which when read with the ETA are drafted on 
the basis that the GTC's only apply if an ISDA has not been executed,  the 
HDD Swap GTC's have been drafted to work in unison with the ISDA framework.  
The HDD Swap GTC together with the specific documentation for each 
transaction constitutes a Confirmation under the ISDA Master Agreement.   As 
such every counterparty should be required to accept the GTC's regardless of 
whether or not they have an ISDA Master Agreement in place.  If an ISDA 
Master has been executed this will govern the HDD Swaps as modified by the 
terms of the relevant GTC's.  If no ISDA Master is in place the GTC's will 
govern.

I have made some drafting changes in respect of the existing HDD Swap GTC's 
which I have forwarded to Mark and Justin for comments.  I will revert to you 
in due course with respect to any changes. 

Best regards,

Denis

=20
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about th=
e=20
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron=01,s success is the increasing qualit=
y and=20
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very be=
st=20
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the=
=20
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

? Hire the best people.
? Provide challenging opportunities.
? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not=
=20
entitlement).
? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The=
=20
PRC is built on this foundation:

? 360 degree performance feedback.
? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions an=
d=20
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understa=
nd=20
the following details:

? Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excel=
lent=018,=20
=01&strong=018, ""satisfactory"", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=
=018 to group all=20
employees.  This year, =01&relative to his/her peers=018 precedes each of t=
hese=20
descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to=
=20
do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers=
. =20
It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher lev=
el=20
compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current perio=
d=20
if other employees=01, performance raised the bar.
? Teamwork.  A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee t=
o=20
gain, others must suffer.  However, feedback is explicitly solicited on=20
teamwork when evaluating each individual=01,s performance.  Anyone who atte=
mpts=20
to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others i=
n=20
the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance=
=20
criterion.
? Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has=
=20
been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistentl=
y=20
captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made=
=20
the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee=
=20
talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30%=20
strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC=
=20
committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at=
=20
Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is=
=20
some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face=
=20
this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance =
or=20
are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations=
=20
adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informe=
d=20
discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflec=
ts=20
their groups=01, overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
? Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated =01&satisfactory=018 or below shoul=
d know=20
his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to=20
communicate ratings of =01&strong=018 and above.  In all cases, employees w=
ill=20
receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of=20
success, and areas that need improvement.

We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process.  We woul=
d=20
like your feedback and ideas on how to improve the PRC process going=20
forward.  Therefore, we will be conducting an eSpeak in the near future, an=

Just heard from Stacy Dickson on BHP Copper.  There is no special requirement for the guaranty just because the parent is Australian.  Attached is the required format.  Let's try to get a $2 MM guaranty to cover the $1 MM+ exposure.

PLEASE ASK YOUR BHP CONTACT TO VERIFY THAT BHP BILLITON LTD IS INDEED THE CORRECT NAME OF THE GUARANTOR.  THIS IS CRITICAL.  I went to the BHP website, but I couldn't tell if BHP Billiton Ltd. is a legal entity name or just a ""doing business as"" name.

2394,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.
