    MS STALLING?... MORE JOBS IN 2002... CABLE WOES PERSIST...

    Could Microsoft be stalling? The nine
    states still pursing the software giant's
    antitrust case sure think so. They've
    asked a federal judge to reject Microsoft's
    request to delay the remedy hearings,
    though Microsoft says any holdup is
    the states' fault for seeking such a
    tough remedy.

Northwest Natural In Talks With Enron Over Portland Utility
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Robin Sidel, Rebecca Smith and Nikhil Deogun

The Wall Street Journal
B2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. is in advanced discussions to sell its Portland General Electric utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for about $1.8 billion in cash and stock in a highly leveraged transaction that would eventually give Enron a minority stake in Northwest, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The discussions are at a very delicate stage, and some important points need to be finalized, these people caution. The current environment could also make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn't a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could be announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural is also expected to assume roughly $1 billion in debt.
Enron and Northwest Natural declined to comment. 
If a transaction is consummated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agreement to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell apart in part because of the California energy crisis. 
A purchase of Portland General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a market capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more than 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Wash. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million customers in Oregon. 
The deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whose executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwest's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating officer of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board. 
By buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when prices are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people familiar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is somewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transaction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in Northwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the transaction with debt and equity offerings. 
Shares of Northwest Natural were trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10. 
For Enron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-year ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break into California's deregulating electricity market. But the utility business proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selling off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. And California's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less attractive place for Enron to do business. 
Enron, which also owns a major gas-transmission pipeline system, has a history of buying assets and businesses, learning what it can from them, and then selling off the bulk of physical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere. 
It isn't clear where Enron will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale. Its broadband telecommunications business is in the doldrums and it recently said it would invest $250 million in it this year, down from a formerly projected $750 million.

     Houston, Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, is in talks to sell its Portland General Electric
utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co., more than five months after
a planned sale to Sierra Pacific Resources collapsed.

     Northwest didn't give a price in a faxed statement. The Wall

stock and assumed debt, citing unidentified people familiar with
the matter. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer declined to comment.

LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Enron Corp is in advanced talks to sell its Oregon-based Portland General utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co for $1.8 billion, the Wall Street Journal's online edition reported. 
Citing people familiar with the matter, it said talks were at a delicate stage and financing could be a problem for Northwest, which has a market value of only about $650 million.
But a deal could be announced in the next few days with Northwest assuming also some $1 billion of debt, it said. 
Earlier this year, Enron's plans to sell Portland to Sierra Pacific Resources Corp broke down amid the California power crisis. 
In the aftermath of that deal's collapse, industry sources said Britain's Scottish Power Plc , which owns another Oregon-based utility PacifiCorp, had also held talks to buy Portland.

Enron May Sell Portland for $2.8 Billion, WSJ Says (Update3)

Enron May Sell Portland for $2.8 Billion, WSJ Says (Update3)

     (Adds sale of oil field in India in sixth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, is in advanced talks to sell its Portland General
Electric utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for about $2.8
billion in cash, stock and assumed debt, the Wall Street Journal
said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.

     Houston-based Enron ``is getting close to another
transaction'' involving Portland General, Chief Executive Kenneth
Lay said at a conference in New York last month. Enron spokesman
Mark Palmer wasn't immediately available to comment.

     Enron has been trying to sell the utility for more than a
year as it focuses on trading. A $3.1 billion sale to Sierra
Pacific Resources collapsed in April because the California power
crisis made it hard to win approval. Northwest Natural Gas serves
more than half a million Oregon and Washington residents.

     Enron shares declined as much as 2.5 euros, or 6.6 percent,
35.5 ($33) in Germany. They've have fallen 60 percent this year
and dropped 1.2 percent to $33.10 in U.S. trading yesterday.

     Some terms of the transaction, which includes about $1.5
billion in assumed debt, still need to be completed, the newspaper
said. An agreement on the sale of the Portland, Oregon-based
utility may be announced in the next few days, the Journal said.

                          Shift in Focus

     Enron earlier this week agreed to sell oil and natural-gas
fields in India to U.K.'s BG Group Plc for $388 million as it
moves away from owning assets such as power plants and pipelines
to concentrate on trading and brokering energy and other
commodities.

     At a price of $2.8 billion, Portland General would fetch 1.2
times sales for Enron, less than the average of four times revenue
paid for U.S. utilities this year, Bloomberg data show.

     Mergers and acquisitions in the energy industry surged at the
start of the year as electricity and natural-gas prices reached a
record high. Since then, prices of power and gas have slumped, in
turn deterring companies from making purchases.

     U.S. natural-gas prices, after reaching a record high at the
end of last year, have since plunged 76 percent to $2.413 for each
million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

     Portland General, which Enron bought in 1997 as a platform to
sell power into California's deregulating market, has 725,027
customers in 51 cities, according to the company's Web site.
Portland, Oregon-based Northwest Natural said in July second-
quarter profit more than doubled to $4.3 million amid cooler
weather and customer growth.


USA: Northwest Natural increases quarterly common div.

10/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

PORTLAND, Ore., Oct 5 (Reuters) - Northwest Natural Gas Co. , a utility serving Oregon and Washington, on Friday said its board has increased the company's quarterly dividend on its common stock to 31.5 cents from 31 cents a share. 
All dividends, including regular quarterly dividends on the company's outstanding series of preferred and preference stock, will be paid Nov 15 to shareholders of record on Oct 31, Northwest Natural said in a statement.
Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Reiten said the higher dividend is supported by the company's positive financial outlook including solid customer growth, additional earnings potential from the natural gas storage and electric generation markets, and continuing cost savings. 
The Wall Street Journal's online edition, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Friday that energy group Enron Corp. is in advanced talks to sell its Oregon-based Portland General utility to Northwest Natural for $1.8 billion. 
A spokesman for Northwest Natural, which serves about 530,000 customers in western Oregon and southwest Washington, could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Shares of Northwest Natural climbed $1.04, or 4.17 percent, to $25.99 on Thursday.

Enron to eliminate 500 jobs in Europe
LONDON -- Enron Corp. plans to cut 500 jobs in Europe, about 10 percent of its work force there, according to the company's chief executive in Europe, John Sherriff. 
The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Houston-based Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989. Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy trading businesses have been held back by the slow progress toward market liberalization in the European Union. 



UK's BG Says Purchase Of Enron India Assets In Jeopardy

10/05/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K. oil and gas company BG Group PLC (BRG) Friday said a disagreement has broken out that threatens to scuttle its $388 million acquisition of the Indian upstream assets of Enron Corp. (ENE), the U.S. energy group. 
Company spokesperson Nicole McMahon said BG's goal of acquiring Enron's operatorship of the offshore Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukti oil and gas field was being challenged by the fields' two other partners - state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) and Reliance Industries Ltd.(P.REL) - which jointly hold a 70% stake in the assets.
The Indian government wants ONGC and Reliance to have first option on operatorship, which was being pursued by both companies, an Indian newspaper reported Friday. 
When the transaction was announced Wednesday, BG made it clear it would walk away from the deal if it didn't get outright operatorship. 
McMahon said negotiations are continuing with ONGC and Reliance who ""have both expressed interest in being the operator of both fields."" 
""We believe we have the relevant skills and experience to be the operator,"" she said. She didn't, however, confirm that BG will pull out of the deal if didn't inherit Enron's operatorship of both Tapti and Panna/Mukti fields, located off India's west coast. 
""We would have to assess the reasons and the outcomes and consider our options,"" she said 
She said a decision will be made by the end of October. 
BG has portrayed the purchase of Enron Oil and Gas Ltd., or EOGIL, as significant, both boosting the group's global hydrocarbon production by up to 7%, and diversifying its distribution and pipeline interests in the fast-growing Indian energy market. 
About 1018 GMT, BG Group shares were flat at 272.75 pence.

Enron CFO's Partnership Had Millions in Profit
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, A=
ndrew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it=
 did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document.=20
The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms =
of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the=
 partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.
Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more=
 than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capit=
al increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, whic=
h was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron.=20
The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investor=
s in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow =
as the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicate=
s the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction =
early.=20
The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders an=
d analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putti=
ng the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron=
 shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing =
LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wach=
ovia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credi=
t Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston.=20
Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuou=
s time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming th=
e nation's biggest energy-trading company.=20
This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured bus=
iness initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $6=
18 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on inve=
stments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix =
Corp., a water company. A small chunk of that write-off, about $35 million,=
 was attributed to ending certain LJM2-related transactions. That terminati=
on also produced a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as th=
e company decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM=
2 deals.=20
At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down 9.9%=
, or $3.20, to $29 a share. Within the past year, the stock had topped $80 =
a share.=20
Enron officials didn't have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document=
. Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper. They=
 said the LJM2 deals, like ones done with other parties, were aimed at help=
ing hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding source=
s of capital.=20
Mr. Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2. In la=
te July, he formally severed his ties with LJM2, as a result of what Enron =
officials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareho=
lders. Mr. Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been w=
ith the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managin=
g company investments.=20
Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now=
 helping to operate LJM2, declined to comment. He also wouldn't describe hi=
s relation to LJM2.=20
In his April 30 report, Mr. Fastow said the partnership, which raised $394 =
million, had invested in several Enron-related deals involving power plants=
 and other assets as well as company stock. The document said LJM2 sought a=
 29% internal rate of return. That was down from a 48% targeted rate of ret=
urn at the end of 2000, which the document said was due in part to a declin=
e in the value of LJM2's investment in New Power Co., an Enron-related ener=
gy retailer. In some transactions, LJM2 did much better than the 29% target=
, though this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals.=20
In September 2000, the partnership invested $30 million in ""Raptor III,"" wh=
ich involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a se=
t price for six months. Four months into this deal, LJM2 approached Enron t=
o settle the investment early, ""causing LJM2 to receive its $30 million cap=
ital invested plus $10.5 million in profit,"" the report said. The renegotia=
tion was before a decline in Enron's stock price, which could have forced L=
JM2 to buy Enron shares at a loss of as much as $8 each, the document indic=
ated.

Enron CFO Profited From Partnerships With Company, WSJ Reports
2001-10-19 01:00 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow realized profits through a limited
partnership that did business with Enron, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an internal partnership document.

     LJM2 Co-Investment LP, of which Fastow is a general partner,
made millions of dollars on transactions with Enron, the paper
said. Fastow and possibly a handful of partnership associates made
$7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in
capital increases on an investment of about $3 million in the
partnership, the paper said.

     Enron shareholder Fred Greenberg filed a lawsuit yesterday,
alleging that Enron's board cost the company at least $35 million
by allowing Fastow to manage partnerships that bought Enron
assets. Enron reported $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from
failed investments.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

European Travel Tip

When travelling to the U.K. with your hair dryer, electric shaver,  etc., 
don't forget to buy an adapter to fit in the U.K. sockets  before you leave 
home - or at latest in the airport upon arrival.  You are unlikely to find 
these adapters commonly available anywhere  else in the U.K. Adapters are 
available in all electrical shops,  but these are for U.K. appliances to fit 
non U.K. sockets, i.e.,  for when U.K. citizens are travelling outside of the 
U.K. Don't  forget that U.K. voltage is 240 volts - it will fry your 110 
volt  appliance without the correct transforming adapter. -Old Mill Private

Upgrades and  Downgrades.? Some of these  players are obvious moves up or=

QBs Moving  Up?

QB Aaron  Brooks (NO)? Brooks made my upgrade list last week  and I put my=

some mistakes and fought back from adversity several times.? The obvious=20
comparison is a young  Randall Cunningham.? He=01,s skinny and  has a littl=

QB Trent  Dilfer (Bal)? I said a couple of weeks ago that Dilfer  might pla=

the late season 1999 Tony Banks role as coach Brian Billick revives  anothe=
r=20
struggling? QB=01,s  career.? Dilfer seems very  comfortable with what Bill=

QB Brad  Johnson (Was)? Jeff George yields to the young man from  Florida=
=20
State.? His knee is  reportedly good to go and he=01,s been cleared by the=

trainers as fit to  start.? Considering the troubles the  team endured with=

QB Ryan Leaf  (SD)? Kordell Stewart, Trent Dilfer and Ryan  Leaf?? You gott=

making plays.?  Granted, he still throws the ugly interception(s) and he ge=

with=20
Freddie Jones and Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham are  veterans who can make =

difference.?  This win will have to buoy the spirits and  enthusiasm.

RBs Moving Up?

RB Mike  Anderson (Den)? Once is a coincidence.? Twice is a trend. You=01,v=
e got=20
to start  handing credit to Mike Shanahan, Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubia=
k,=20
and that  offensive line. Like everyone else, I marveled at the way Olandis=
=20
Gary was able  to run last year when Terrell Davis went down.? What a great=
=20
job of scouting we all  thought.? But hey, Gary was a pretty  highly touted=
=20
back.? But Mike  Anderson???? Anderson=01,s a  fine back but I=01,ve got to=
 believe=20
it=01,s a team deal here.? The good news is that Anderson=01,s team  isn=01=
,t going=20
anywhere without him and he looks to remain a factor while Terrell  Davis=
=20
recovers from the mystery lower leg ailment.? Watch this during the week, b=
ut=20
it  wouldn=01,t surprise me a bit to see Davis miss another game. ?And as l=
ong=20
as Anderson rolls up 195  rushing yards a game like he did Sunday, you won=
=01,t=20
see Shanahan crying over TD  being out.? Granted 80 of those  yards came on=
=20
one big run but he had a great game any way you slice  it.?

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal)? I=01,ve been eating crow (Raven?) for a  while now a=
s I=20
was one of those guys not convinced Jamal Lewis would excel at  this level=
=20
after a very disappointing 1999 season at Tennessee.? Lewis is running like=

remains a huge part of it.? His only down side is that he=01,s off this  we=
ek=20
with a bye.? But that week 16  matchup against Arizona is looking very=20
tasty=01(?

RB Corey  Dillon (Cin)? Considering what he does with that  surrounding cas=
t,=20
I could make a strong case that Corey Dillon is the best back  in the NFL.?=
=20
There have been few  passing attacks in recent memory as impotent as the=20
Bengals, yet Dillon  continues to pound out the yards when defenses know=20
exactly what=01,s coming at  them.? It=01,s amazing to watch.? I don=01,t k=
now how=20
long he can keep it up  but he=01,s got the woeful Cardinals this week and =
you=20
have to like  that.?

RB Warrick  Dunn (TB)? Dunn made the upgrade list last week in  the wake of=
=20
Mike Alstott=01,s knee injury and he delivered in a big way for his  owners=
=20
Sunday with 129 total yards including 2 TDs.? There was some talk about him=
=20
sharing  carries but he was the only guy besides QB Shaun King to run the=
=20
ball for Tampa  Bay.? Look for more of the same from  the Bucs and new=20
offensive coordinator Warren Sapp=01(? Seriously, Dunn showed he could hand=
le =20
20 rushing attempts and I think you=01,ll continue to see them go with what=
=01,s =20
working.? =20



RB Michael  Pittman (Ari)? Pittman may be the lone bright spot on  the=20
Arizona team.? I told you last  week that coach McGinnis loves the guy and=
=20
you saw the results last night as  Pittman rambled for 77 yards on only 13=
=20
carries (5.7 ypc)? Like Corey Dillon, the surrounding team  kills his value=
=20
but if he ran for a team that held a lead, he=01,d be awesome.? Unfortunate=
ly, I=20
don=01,t see Arizona  turning into such a team anytime soon so don=01,t get=
 too=20
excited.? But overall, I like the guy a  lot.?

RB Richie  Anderson (NYJ)? Each year, there are always unheralded  guys who=
=20
post nice numbers but remain well below the radar of many owners.? Many tim=
es=20
they are RBs who quietly post  yardage (and FF points) receiving the ball.?=
=20
Anderson is a prime example of one such  player this year (as?are Tony=20
Richardson and Stanley Pritchett)? He=01,s caught 15 passes over the last 3=
 =20
games and with Curtis Martin nursing a sore gluteus maximus, that trend wil=
l =20
likely continue.???

RB Robert  Holcombe (StL)? It doesn=01,t take a rocket scientist to  see th=
at=20
Marshall Faulk isn=01,t 100%.?  Red flags went up across the country when M=
ike=20
Martz elected to give  Holcombe that shot at the goalline Sunday.?  6 weeks=
=20
ago, that would have been Faulk=01,s carry all day long.? Holcombe looks to=
=20
benefit if Faulk=01,s  workload continues to be decreased.? =20



RB Brad  Hoover (Car)? Aside from having one of those cool  names the fans=
=20
can yell whenever he does something good, Hoover has shown to be  a capable=
=20
replacement for candybone Tshimanga Biakabutuka.? He doesn=01,t have the=20
physical tools of a  Biakabutuka but you can=01,t deny he hasn=01,t been=20
effective.? It wouldn=01,t surprise me a bit to see  Hoover continue to see=
=20
action.

WRs Moving Up

WR Marvin  Harrison (Ind)? Harrison stated before Sunday=01,s game  that he=

2 TD catches and he could  have had another.? Yes, you=01,d like  to see mo=

Major League with the new glasses.?  Seriously, if he=01,s had bad vision t=

WR Joe  Jurevicius (NYG)? With Ike Hilliard out, Jurevicius got  all he eve=

the=20
offense. ?With WRs Peerless Price and Jeremy  McDaniel not doing much, it=
=01,s=20
pretty much Eric Moulds and  Reimersma.



TE David  LaFluer (Dal)? With Jackie Harris nursing a sprained  knee, LaFlu=
er=20
seized the opportunity and put together an excellent game with 6  catches f=
or=20
45 yards and a TD.? Keep  an eye on Harris but this could be a trend.

TE Anthony  Becht (NYJ)? Becht earns the upgrade just for the  beautiful=20
diving TD catch Sunday.?  At this point in the season, rookies aren=01,t re=
ally=20
rookies any more as  most have enough experience that they=01,re learning t=
he=20
ropes.? Becht appears to be a fast learner and  could give this team a huge=

QBs Moving Down?

QB Jeff  George (Was)? Audition time is over.? Didn't you have the feeling=
=20
owner Danny  Snyder would have loved for his pet QB George to go wild befor=
e=20
Brad Johnson  sits down to the negotiating table to talk about next year (i=

=20
old.?  Brad Johnson will get the start this week.? You never know with knee=
=20
injuries so  George certainly still has value, just nothing like he did as =
a =20
starter.



QB Trent  Green (StL)? Chris Berman made a great point last  night on ESPN=
=01,s=20
Prime Time.? Trent  Green is a nice player but let=01,s forget this talk ab=
out=20
him being the same  player as Kurt Warner.??  Another loss for the Rams=20

ly =20
fighting for their lives and it won=01,t be Green behind center.?

QB Shane  Matthews (Chi)? The University of Florida has a great  program an=

QB Drew  Bledsoe (NE)? Whether it=01,s the thumb or the WRs or the  play=20
calling, Bledsoe is struggling.?  I used to blame this on Bill Belichick=20
coming up with a Jets defense that  shattered Bledsoe=01,s confidence and t=

him into a tailspin this time of year  but now I=01,ll have to start lookin=
g for=20
other theories.?? As Terry Glenn said, =01& it felt  like the defense knew=
=20
exactly what we were going to do=018.? That=01,s bad for a Thursday  game.

RBs Moving Down?

RB Emmitt  Smith? (Dal)? As you  probably saw, Emmitt was knocked out for a=
=20
moment during the Thanksgiving Day  game.? Check his status this  week.? Ev=
en=20
100%, he faces a tough  stretch of games to finish the season against Tampa=
=20
Bay, Washington, New York  Giants, and Tennessee.?

RB J.J.  Johnson (Mia)? Johnson had a nice game Sunday but early  indicatio=

n=20
takes a seat.?

RB Jamal  Anderson (Atl)? It looks to me like the Falcons are very  close t=
o=20
packing it in.? He may be  worth one more start against the porous Seattle=

defense this week but after  that, he=01,s got a bye and then New Orleans.?

RB Marshall  Faulk (StL)? Understand, he=01,s still a top RB, but I think h=
is =20
value is clearly falling a bit.? He  looks less than 100% but the most=20
telling indicator by far was the Robert  Holcombe goalline carry.? 6 weeks =
=20
ago, no way does Holcombe get that carry.?  He=01,s still a must start and=
=20
Warner will likely help his stock but I=01,m a  little worried.?

RB Curtis  Martin (NYJ)? The weather conditions made it tough to  get a tru=

picture of Martin=01,s health but it was pretty easy to see he wasn=01,t  1=

Sunday.? Between Bernie  Parmalee and Richie Anderson, coach Al Groh has=20

RB Jermaine  Fazande (SD) ?The big guy yields to Terrell Fletcher  and look=
s=20

WR Marcus  Robinson (Chi)? One has to wonder what could have been  with Jim=

WR Sylvester  Morris (KC)? Morris has been especially disappointing  as one=

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Trent Green , QB STL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Green will get one more week as the team's starter.  He will start this 
Sunday vs. New Orleans, but Kurt Warner  is expected to return for the 
December 3rd game at Carolina.  This won't be the last you've heard from 
Green.  There has been talk that he will take his services elsewhere next 
year in hopes of obtaining a starting job.  For now look for Green to put up 
big numbers against the Saints defense this week.  New Orleans has a strong 
pass rush but their corners won't be able to contain the Rams' receivers long 
enough for them to pressure Green.    

 Lions , DT DET - FDIC Updated 11/22/00 
 Detroit had one of the top pass rushes in the NFL last year but are 
currently among the worst garnering a mere 22 sacks.   The Lions could be 
primed for a turnaround in the final games of the season.  Detroit's pass 
rush has been much improved since the resignation of head coach Bobby Ross.  
Robert Porcher has played especially well in the last two games tallying five 
sacks and forcing a fumble.  Look for them to have a field day against the 
Patriots Sunday.  New England has allowed an astonishing 38 sacks this 
season.     

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 An MRI on Bates knee showed no structural damage and he is expected to play 
against the Patriots Thursday.  Bates has been a reliable third-down back for 
the Lions but hasn't provided much help for Fantasy teams this season.  Don't 
expect that to change when he faces the Patriots Thursday.     

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/22/00 
 Stewart was able to practice Tuesday and will play in Thursday's game 
against the Patriots.  He suffered a hip-pointer injury Sunday that forced 
him to miss Monday's practice.  Don't be surprised if Stewart struggles 
against the Patriots.  If he isn't full strength he may have a hard time 
avoiding New England's linebackers.   

 Marlon Barnes , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Barnes gained 11 yards on three carries against the Buccaneers Sunday.  
Starter James Allen will be back in the lineup once again this week after 
cutting his hand in last Sunday's game.  Barnes will resume his role as a 
third-down back.  He has played sparingly this season but could have a larger 
role in the offense next year.      

 Eddie Kennison , WR CHI - Murder Inc. Updated 11/22/00 
 Kennison has been a major disappointment as the Bears' second receiver this 
season catching just one touchdown pass through 11 games.  Things won't get 
any better this week when he faces a stingy Jets pass defense.  New York has 
only given up 11 passing TDs all season.  Kennison may get a few catches this 
week but don't expect him to score for your team.  At this point it would be 
wise to bench him if you haven't already.     

 Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Edinger has been on a roll lately making nine of his last ten field goals.  
He could have another big week against the Jets this week.  The Bears 
shouldn't have any problems moving the chains -the Jets have given up a lot 
of yards this season but have managed to keep the opposition out of the end 
zone.  New York's defense has also seen opposing offenses attempt an 
NFL-leading 28 field goals.  If Edinger can remain accurate in the swirling 
New Jersey winds, he will have a big game.     

 Bears , DT CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Look for the Bears secondary to contribute a few interceptions for your 
Fantasy team this week as Chicago faces the Jets and QB Vinny Testaverde this 
week.  Testaverde has thrown two or more interceptions in his last five 
games.  But if the Bears don't put any pressure on Testaverde and Curtis 
Martin they will rip the defense apart.  Chicago has a weak pass rush and an 
even softer run defense.    

 Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/22/00 
 Hearst has been added to the 49ers' active  roster.  Head coach Steve 
Mariucci says he probably won't get into a game this season, so it wouldn't 
be wise to pick Hearst up as a free agent.  He had spent the entire year on 
the physically-unable-to-perform list after missing all of last season while 
recovering from a career-threatening ankle injury.  Keep an eye on Hearst 
though.  If his condition continues to progress he could be a sleeper pick 
next year.    

 Tony Horne , WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Horne, one of the league's best kick returners, will be out for four to six 
weeks after breaking a bone in his right foot during Monday night's game 
against Washington. He had a 24.2-yard average on kickoff returns, including 
a 103-yard touchdown. The Rams may use Az-Zahir Hakim, their punt returner, 
on kickoffs, but are more likely to sign someone.  

 Charles Kirby , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Mike Alstott now out for at least the remainder of the regular season, 
Kirby is the only remaining true fullback on the Buccaneers' roster. Still, 
he was promoted from the practice squad just two weeks ago merely to serve as 
a blocker in short-yardage situations, so don't expect him to come close to 
the 12 carries per game Alstott was averaging. Warrick Dunn will be the 
primary focus of the running game.  

 Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Faulk made an impressive return from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
last night against Washington, making nine catches for 88 yards and a 
touchdown while rushing for 33 yards on nine carries. He had the surgery just 
14 days prior, so the Rams were light on his rushing load, but Faulk looked 
solid in his first game back. Expect him to be close to full strength when 
the Rams play New Orleans on Sunday.  

 Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Steelers have activated Blackwell from the physically unable to perform 
list and placed him on their 53-man roster. He was placed on that list July 
16 after suffering a May knee injury, and is an unrestricted free agent after 
the season. Still, don't count on much, if any, Fantasy value from Blackwell. 
 

 Mario Bates , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Lions are awaiting results of an MRI performed on Bates' injured knee, 
which he sustained during Sunday's game against the Giants. He is less likely 
to play Thursday against New England than first-stringer James Stewart.  

 James Stewart , RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/21/00 
 Stewart was unable to practice with the team yesterday after suffering a hip 
pointer in Sunday's game against the Giants. With the Lions' next game coming 
Thursday against New England, there isn't much time for him to heal. Coach 
Gary Moeller thinks Stewart will be able to play through the injury. His 
status is more critical with backup Mario Bates also ailing. If neither can 
go, fullback Cory Schlesinger, running back Sedrick Irvin and special teams 
member Brock Olivo would fill in.  

 Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Despite a sprained left knee that required a brace and had him limping 
yesterday, Mitchell is still hopeful he can play Sunday against Pittsburgh. 
He is listed on the injury report as doubtful after suffering a sprained MCL 
during last Sunday's game against New England, but an MRI performed yesterday 
revealed no damage. If Mitchell can play, he will get the start. He'll very 
likely play if it's physically possible.  

 James Allen , RB CHI - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Allen will not miss practice this week 
after suffering a cut on his right hand during Sunday's game against Tampa 
Bay. He should be ready to play next Sunday against the Jets.  

 Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With Shane Matthews performing well as the starter, the Bears can afford to 
be patient with McNown as he recovers from a separated left shoulder. He 
threw 15-yard passes with Matthews before Sunday's game against Tampa Bay and 
will participate in some drills tomorrow. McNown could serve as the third 
quarterback next Sunday against the Jets.   

 Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Murder Inc. Updated 11/21/00 
 Chandler might lose some playing time over the season's final weeks, as the 
Falcons try to evaluate rookie Doug Johnson for their future. This isn't a 
condemnation of the veteran Chandler, but his owners should make sure he's 
going to start each week before giving him the nod.  

 Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Falcons might consider giving Johnson some playing time over the 
season's final weeks, as the team decides whether he can serve as the QB of 
the future or if one will need to be taken in next year's draft. If he is 
given a shot, those in keeper leagues should keep a close eye on his 
performance.  

 Obafemi Ayanbadejo , RB BAL - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Ayanbadejo will likely be inactive for Sunday's game against Cleveland. With 
Baltimore's bye week coming up after that, he will get an extra week to rest, 
and should be ready to roll against San Diego in Week 15.  

 Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 The Eagles' signal caller is really maturing right before our eyes.  He 
completed 25-of-34 passes for 217 yards and accounted for two touchdowns in 
Sunday's win over Arizona.  He will need to keep his composure next week 
against the Redskins, as the two teams battle for first place in the NFC 
East.  The Eagles will need a huge performance from McNabb if they are to 
beat Washington, so give him a start this week in the big game.    

 Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 11/21/00 
 Connell caught five passes for 96 yards in Monday night's win over the 
Rams.  Washington will face a tough Eagles' secondary next week, which will 
be looking to keep their team in first place in the NFC East.  If the 'Skins 
can establish their running game early, Connell could have a big game.      

 Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 11/21/00 
 George was very impressive in Monday night's big win over St. Louis.  He 
completed 24-of-34 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns against the 
Rams, further clouding the quarterback situation in Washington.  Starter Brad 
Johnson should know by Thursday if he is able to play next week against the  
Eagles, so keep tabs on his progress in the coming days if you have either of 
these players on your roster.    

 Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis accounted for 106 yards of total offense but didn't score a touchdown 
as Washington defeated St. Louis 33-20 on Monday night. It was the first time 
in seven weeks that Davis had been held out of the end zone. Look for the 
'Skins to establish Davis early in the game next week against the Eagles in 
an effort to open up their passing game.     

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  ""We'll see Wednesday or Thursday,"" said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, ""but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play.""    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 German was added to the injury report with a strained hamstring and is 
listed as probable for Sunday's game.  He was used as the third receiver 
earlier this season when Tim Dwight was sidelined with various injuries but 
has done little to push for extra playing time.  German has just one catch 
all season.     

 Packers , DT GB - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 The Packers have a tough test ahead of them this week when they face the 
Colts and the trio of Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James, and Marvin Harrison.  
Their pass defense has been mediocre this season totaling 25 sacks and 
allowing 216.3 yards per game.  They will need to apply a little more 
pressure on Indianapolis to contain Manning and Harrison.  Look for Green Bay 
to come at Manning with multiple blitz coverages but that may not be enough 
for them to have success against the Colts and their balanced attack.    

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/17/00 
 Jones has come down with a case of walking pneumonia, and likely won't 
travel with the team on their trip to Philadelphia for this week's game 
against the Eagles. Jones has been a real disappointment to Fantasy owners 
thus far, accounting for only 410 yards of total offense and two touchdowns 
this season.  

 David Sloan , TE DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/17/00 
 Sloan practiced Thursday and is expected to play in Sunday's game.  He is 
recovering from a pulled hamstring that kept him out of last week's game.  
Sloan has caught seven passes in his last two games but has failed to score  
a touchdown this season.    

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 11/17/00 
 With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the 
start this week against the Chiefs.  If Morris has been one of your main 
tailbacks this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still 
available.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/17/00 
 Morris remains questionable for Sunday's game against the Chiefs with an 
ankle injury.  Head Coach Wade Phillips believes that Morris will be a 
game-time decision, so keep the Bills' rookie tailback on the bench this week 
if at all possible.   

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/17/00 
 Favre practiced Thursday and is expected to start Sunday's game at 
Indianapolis.  ""The ball came out sharp,"" said offensive coordinator Tom 
Rossley.  ""He was right on the money. I was pleased with what he did today.""  
If Favre can stay in the game this Sunday he could have a big day.  The Colts 
have one of the weaker pass defenses in the NFL, having allowed 15 TD passes 
this season.    

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/16/00 
 Sanders had his best game in five weeks last Sunday, catching five passes 
for 82 yards in Arizona's 31-14 loss to the Vikings. He is currently battling 
a quadricep injury, but is listed as probable for this week's matchup with 
the Eagles.  It would be a wise move to bench Sanders this week, especially 
against an aggressive Philadelphia secondary.   

 Jake Plummer , QB ARI - FDIC Updated 11/16/00 
 Plummer completed 19-of-28 passes for 219 yards last Sunday against the 
Vikings, but was held without a touchdown pass.  In fact, ""The Snake"" has 
thrown only one touchdown pass in the last four weeks. Things won't get 
better for Plummer this week against the Eagles, who will blitz him 
relentlessly and likely force him to make bad decisions.    

 Troy Brown , WR NE - FDIC Updated 11/16/00 
 Brown caught only two passes for ten yards last Sunday against the Browns.  
Although he has shown flashes of brilliance in the past, Brown is far too 
inconsistent to be considered a starter by most Fantasy league standards.  

 Adam Vinatieri , K NE - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Vinatieri has connected on eight consecutive field goal attempts, dating 
back to Week Four against the Dolphins. With New England's offense sputtering 
in recent weeks, don't expect much from Vinatieri this week against the 
Bengals.    

 Rod Rutledge , TE NE - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Rutledge caught three passes for 20 yards last Sunday against the Browns, 
including his first career touchdown. With the release of Erich Bjornson, he 
should become more involved in the Patriots' offense in the coming weeks.  If 
you relied on Bjornson as your everday tight end, it would be a wise move to 
pickup Rutledge.     

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/00 
 Pickens was held out of practice yesterday because of his injured hamstring. 
He has missed four of his last six games, but Coach Jeff Fisher says that he 
is improving. Pickens will likely be a gametime decision.  

 Bashir Yamini , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 The Titans may need to make a roster move with their injuries at wide 
receiver. One possibility is to sign Yamini, who is on the practice squad and 
was on the roster earlier in the year, to replace Chris Jackson, who will be 
out for the remainder of the year with a herniated disc in his back. Jackson 
had recently been signed off the practice squad.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 George was able to participate fully in practice yesterday after receiving a 
cortisone shot for his injured right big toe earlier in the week. He plans on 
getting more involved in practice this week and hopes to get it strong enough 
to play Sunday against Cleveland. The only real concern here is whether 
George may develop turf toe, which could require surgery. Keep a close eye on 
him, and be sure to insure your roster with his backup, Rodney Thomas.  

 Wade Richey , K SF - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Richey has struggled recently missing four of his last six field-goal 
tries.  Last year Richey made 21-of-23 attempts.  He should get a lot of 
attempts this week against the Falcons.  San Francisco should be able to move 
the chains against Atlanta, but with Terrell Owens suffering from turf toe, 
The Niners will have problems scoring touchdowns.    

 Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Beasley missed last Sunday's game because of left-knee and ankle injuries 
and remains questionable for this week.  Terry Jackson will start at fullback 
if Beasley is unable to play.  In the beginning of the season the Niners 
threw to Beasley in goal-line situations.  Recently they have chosen to let 
Charlie Garner run the ball or to throw to their wideouts.   Beasley scored 
five touchdowns in the first three games, but has none since then.    

 Jerry Rice , WR SF - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/16/00 
 Rice sat out of practice Wednesday to rest his sore back.  He is expected to 
play this week and is listed as probable on the injury report.  Rice had five 
catches for 59 yards in the season opener against Atlanta.  At this point in 
his career Rice has very little Fantasy value.  He is being used mainly for 
routes over the middle and as a decoy in goal line situations.    

 Chad Dukes , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 To add depth to its backfield, St. Louis has signed Dukes, who spent time on 
the Redskins' roster earlier this season.  Dukes will probably be the backup 
halfback against the Redskins Monday behind Justin Watson.  Regular backup 
Trung Canidate is out for the season after breaking his right wrist Sunday.   
 

 Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Ramiro Updated 11/16/00 
 Hakim is suffering from a fractured rib but head coach Mike Martz said he 
will play against the Redksins Monday.  This week's matchup could be the 
ultimate test for the Rams' receiving team this week as they go up against 
one of the best secondaries in the league.  Start all of your Rams receivers 
as usual but don't be surprised if some of them struggle.    

 Andrew Glover , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Glover sat out practice Tuesday with a sore back and is listed as probable 
for Sunday's game against the Raiders.  He may catch a lot of passes against 
his former team this week.  The Saints are thin on offense, with Ricky 
Williams and Jake Reed sidelined by injury, so Glover could get a lot of 
balls thrown his way.  The Raiders have been succeptible to tight end routes 
this season.  Denver TEs combined for 125 yards and a TD against them last 
week.  Kansas City TE Tony Gonzalez had nine catches for 134 yards against 
Oakland in Week 10.    

 Chris Hetherington , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Hetherington will make the second start of his five-year career Sunday 
against the Vikings.  Hetherington will be filling in for the injured William 
Floyd who suffered broken ribs last week.  He is not as gifted offensively as 
Floyd though, and will be used primarily for blocking assignments.     

 Kris Mangum , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Mangum exited last Sunday's game after the first quarter and did not return 
due to a sprained shoulder.  Mangum's shoulder has allowed him to be more 
flexible in practice and he appeared to be ready for this week's game at 
Minnesota.  ""We'll see,"" Mangum told the Rock Hill Herald .  ""I tried last 
week. I guess I came back a little early. We'll try again this week and see 
what happens.""  Mangum was supposed to start at tight end in place of the 
injured Wesley Walls but his shoulder ailment has sidelined him as well.  
Rookie Casey Crawford will start at TE once again if Mangum is unable to play 
Sunday.        

 Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Hoover has been working out with the first team this week in preparation for 
a possible start against the Vikings Sunday.  Starter Tim Biakabutuka is 
suffering from turf toe and is questionable for the game at Minnesota.  At 
this point in the season selecting Hoover would be a gamble, even if he does 
start Sunday.  Carolina hasn't run the ball too well this season, averaging 
79.4 yards per game.  It might be safer to use a starting back from another 
team even if the player hasn't been too productive.    

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/16/00 
 Kitna was named the AFC's Offensive Player of the Week yesterday after 
passing for three touchdowns in Seattle's 28-21 victory over Jacksonville.  
His reward?  A return to the bench, in all likelihood.  He is expected to be 
the backup to Brock Huard after the bye in a November 26th game against the 
Denver Broncos.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 Owens is still bothered by the turf toe injury that limited his playing time 
in the team's 21-7 win over Kansas City.  Head coach Steve Mariucci is 
seriously considering holding Owens out of this week's game.  Owens still 
leads the NFL in TD receptions with 11 and is third in catches, but the turf 
toe injury could slow him down for the rest of the season.  If he can't play 
Sunday wideout J.J. Stokes would make his second straight start in place of 
him.  

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Leaf may now get the starting nod for this week's game against Denver.  Head 
Coach Mike Riley stated earlier in the week that Jim Harbaugh would be the 
starter, but now says that he will wait a day or two before making a 
decision.  Look elsewhere for a quarterback this week if your roster allows 
it.    

 Jim Harbaugh , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Harbaugh was named the starter for Sunday's game against the Broncos earlier 
in the week, but Head Coach Mike Riley may now be retracting that statement.  
Ryan Leaf took an equal number of snaps as Harbaugh in practice on Wednesday, 
and may get the nod on Sunday.  Riley said that he plans to wait another day 
or two before announcing a starter.  If at all possible, go with another 
quarterback this week.     

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/16/00 
 Jacksonville will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson and Lonnie Marts, 
and probably without cornerback Aaron Beasley, for Sunday's game in 
Pittsburgh. Nickerson, who missed three games with a hamstring injury and the 
last two recovering from knee surgery, went to California yesterday for a 
second opinion and could be out a few more weeks. Marts is still recovering 
from a groin injury, and Beasley is listed as questionable with a back injury 
but is unlikely to play. Rookie T.J. Slaughter, Erik Storz and Jason Craft 
would get the starts at their respective positions. Pittsburgh has a subpar 
passing game, but its running game, led by Jerome Bettis, could give the 
Jaguars' defense fits come Sunday.    

 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/16/00 
 Wheatley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Saints.  He 
didn't play in Monday night's loss to the Broncos, and will be re-evaluated 
by Head Coach Jon Gruden during practice the rest of the week.  Oakland is 
reportedly talking about signing running back Terry Kirby for this week's 
game, which could be a bad sign if you have Wheatley on your Fantasy 
roster.

and somehow I thought that the time passed more quickly if I was in the 
office in my normal routine.  Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.  I set my 
last date of work for Friday, May 11.  Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' 
Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of 
days until Meagan was born.  With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I 
was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.  She was a week 
late, so we just didn't know what to expect.  Tyler's due date was December 
18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.  Of 
course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was 
out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.  A lot of this probably 
depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have 
everything at the house ready.  I still had a lot of energy at the end of my 
pregnancies and I had also managed to get rooms ready early, so I enjoyed 
working as long as I could.

142,"For those teams that have turbines installed after 1990 and/or for those 
turbines which have undergone power  unit changouts, the following 
recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply:

1) DAILY recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas 
which supplies the applicable turbine(s). 

2) This recordkeeping consists of electronic recording (gas chromtograph for 
nitrogen and  delmar or equivelant for sulfur) or stain tubes may also be 
used  for sulfur. These DAILY records include measurements on Saturdays and 
Sundays.

3) The measurement must be taken at the location.  An exception to this is 
that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or 
downstream  of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no 
natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase 
the measurements  for the applicable turbine fuel gas. 

4) Fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent  for  the nitrogen and 
sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy 
retrival.  

5) A turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily 
recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule 
(CFMS) from  the EPA.  Approval of a  CFMS allows a greatly reduced 
recordkeeping and reporting for nitrogen and sulfur.  CFMS requests have been 
submitted for the  following facilities:

   P-1 C/S
   Plains Turbine C/S
   Atoka No 2 C/S
   Monument C/S
   Crawford C/S
   Bloomfield C/S
 
Approvals have not as yet been obtained.  Until issuance of a CFMS, an 
applicable facility is required to continue daily sampling for nitrogen and 
sulfur.   
 
Facilities which have received CFMS from the EPA include:

   La Plata C/S
   P-2 C/S

Please be advised that there may be certain reporting requirements that might 
be required for each CFMS.  I would strongly advise that the La Plata and 
Panhandle  teams review their CFMS and include reporting dates into MCS, so 
that the deadlines and reportings are not missed. 

If you have a turbine facility which is subject to the nitrogen and sulfur 
reporting requirements and would like to reduce the reporting burden, contact 
Butch or myself.

147,"The Texas RailRoad Commission (TRC)  has sent a guideline for cleanup of 
condensate spills to its District Offices for implementation on July 1, 
2000.  Attached is the guideline which is titled,  

Field Guide for the Assessment and Cleanup of Soil and Groundwater 
Contaminated with Condensate From a Spill Incident (Statewide Rules 8, 20, 
and 91)

The introduction to the guideline states that it establishes bench marks and 
protocols that, when met and followed, will demonstrate that condensate 
spills have been addressed in a manner that complies with Statewide Rules 8, 
20, and 91.

Some comments related to this guideline from an industry association meeting 
in mid-July are listed below:

There appeared to be a wide variation in response of the districts to this 
guideline.

The TRC is receiving landowner compliants.  The TRC has gone out and found 
spills not cleaned up, where closure reports have been submitted.  

Parts of the guideline are not clear and the groundwater classification is 
not consistent with TRRP.  A revised guideline might be issued by TRC.

This condensate guideline is temporary until RBCA guidelines are available.  
TRC is working on a software model projected by the end of this year.

Also attached is another guideline that the TRC issued at the same time, 
which is titled:

Field Guide for Reportable Surface Releases of Crude Oil in Non-sensitive 
Areas (Statewide Rules 8, 20, and 91).

In a somewhat related item, the General Land Office on June 23, 2000 issued 
revised penalty guidelines (attached) effective August 1st for oil spills in 
Texas coastal waters.  Spills of less than a gallon will have fines of $250.  
The fines for larger spills will depend on factors such as the size of the 
spills, the number of unauthorized discharges in the past twelve-month 
period, and whether a Sound Management Practice or like program is in place.

Operating Permits - TNRCC is attempting to obtain EPA approval of their Title 
V operating permit program by including Minor New Source Review (NSR) (e.g., 
permits by rule) in the operating permit program. The TNRCC idea is that you 
would make changes or install equipment under a permit by rule as you do now 
under current rules. When your Title V permit is renewed, all Minor NSR 
approvals would be rolled into the permit and included in the renewed permit. 
They are also putting together a General Operating Permit (GOP) that would 
include Minor NSR. It is unknown if EPA will buy this concept.

Upset and Maintenance - A general note: The TNRCC field offices are giving 
different answers to questions that have been asked by industry about the new 
upset and maintenance rules. 

When reporting upset emissions, TNRCC wants you to report all pollutants, not 
just the ones that exceeded the RQs;
It is important to give as much detail as possible on the cause of an upset. 
""Operator error"" is not acceptable to TNRCC and may make it more likely you 
will be investigated by TNRCC if you repeatedly give this as a cause since it 
may appear to the agency that this is a repeat problem that a company is not 
correcting;
TNRCC's Region 12 (Houston Area) is conducting inspections at 20 facilities 
specifically directed at upset notifications. The inspections take about two 
days. Companies are inspected if they make too many upset notifications or 
too few.
When reporting a release of natural gas (unspeciated), you should exclude 
methane and ethane from the reporting and calculation of determining the 
5,000 pound threshold, but according to TNRCC you cannot exclude CO2 or N2;
If you do speciate a release, remember that heptane and nonane are not listed 
pollutants so they default to a 100 pound RQ.

New Source Review - TNRCC has lifted their hold on NSR permits in the Houston 
non-attainment area, but if there are too many permit applications between 
now and December 6 (to beat the new non-attainment regulations that should 
pass on December 6) there is a chance that they will put another hold on 
permits.

EPA Enforcement Priorities - EPA has proposed their enforcement priorities 
for Fiscal Year 2002-3 and they include ""fuels management"". Fuels management 
is broadly defined to include many industries and includes pipelines. It is 
not believed that this directive is aimed at gas pipelines, but it is broad 
enough to include them.

154,"Attached is an additional motion to support the Stage 2 ICAP proposed
Tariff, which is Agenda Item 5B for the May 24 BIC meeting.

As you may know, the translation of the In-City price cap from ICAP to UCAP
is a pending item from the proposed ICAP Manual. The ICAP Working Group
concluded at its last meeting that, if the parties could not agree upon a
translation number, the matter should be taken to FERC for a decision.

FERC Staff has agreed that FERC will take up the issue if no consensus is
reached. Alternative positions on the translation issue will be laid out in
the cover letter to the Tariff filing; comments from any party interested in
filing on the translation issue would be due ten business days after the ISO
files the proposed Tariff. The attached motion seeks approval for this
approach.

The ICAPWG may withdraw the motion if consensus is reached before the BIC
meeting.

the project rep is; CDFG has verbally concurred regarding our proposed
avoidance measures (including trapping) for Tipton kangaroo rats and
blunt-nosed leopard lizard; the project may commence on Coles Levee Ecosystem
Preserve as soon as we implement the biological resource mitigation measures
(preactivity survey - submitted to AERA; trapping; etc.) and the Letter of
Credit (or equivalent) is submitted to CDFG for compensation acres.

Bypass Channel: West Coast Environmental was supposed to have submitted
Streambed Alteration Notification and Clean Water Act (Army Corps)
notification within the last couple of days.

157,"Bill, things have pretty much quieted down on Rogas as compared to the last 
couple of weeks, but heres whats new:

A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to 
discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual 
reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an 
agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed 
to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the 
results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the 
Rogas project.

The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was 
approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety 
Division.  There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by 
application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 
3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet.

Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas 
pipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available 
for purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating 
this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that 
EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary 
acreage for the Rogas project.  This is a major plus for the project.",Bill Rogas,,"the California Fish and Game F&G EOTT Rogas the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall Pipeline Safety

Attached is the PTE analysis for Martin Co. #1 using data provided by Ruth
Jensen.  The PTE for CO is approximately 99.38 tpy.  This is using the AP-42
factors for 4-cycle rich engines operating at less than 90% load.  This PTE
analysis is very close to the Title V limits.  CLose enough to warrant
verification of all parameters.  As you recall AP-42 factors for 4-cycle
rich burns used to be 10 g/hp-hr for equal NOx equal CO operations.  The
AP-42 engine factors were revised in 2000 which resulted in a big increase
in CO emissions.  If you use the current AP-42 factors for 90-105% load, we
bust 100 tpy for CO.

s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=

for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=

America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=

will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=

Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=

will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =

the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.

Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=

EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=

the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=

der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=

commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=

efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=

EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=

newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=

to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=

of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=

These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=

to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=

TURQUOISE: DECEMBER'S BIRTHSTONE
======================================
The highest ranking among all the opaque stones, turquoise-
the ""Turkish stone""-is highly prized throughout Asia and Africa,
not for its particular hoe of blue (a beautiful robin's egg or
sky blue) but more important for its supposed prophylactic and
therapeutic qualities.  The Arabs consider it a lucky stone and
have great confidence in its benevolent action.  Used in rings,
earrings, necklaces, head ornaments and amulets, it protects the
wearer from poison, reptile bites, eye diseases, and the evil
eye.  It was also believed capable of warning of impending death
by changing color.  Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is
associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to
destroy a monster.  Even today it is considered a symbol of
courage, success, and love.  It has also long been associated
American Indian jewelry and art.

Turquoise is an opaque, light to dark blue or blue green stone.
The finest color is an intense blue, with poorer qualities
tending toward yellowish green.  The famous Persian turquoise,
which can be very intense and pleasing blue, is considered a
very rare and valuable gem.  The United States (Arizona and New
Mexico) is also an important source of fine turquoise, and is
now the major source of turquoise used in jewelry worldwide.

All turquoises are susceptible to aging and may turn greenish
or possibly darker with age.  Also, care must be taken when
wearing, both to avoid contact with soap, grease, or other
materials that might discolor it, and to protect it from abuse,
since turquoise scratches fairly easily.

But exercise caution when buying turquoise.  This is a
frequently simulated gem.  Very fine glass imitations are
produced that are difficult to distinguish from the genuine.
Very fine adulterated stones, and reconstructed stones (from
turquoise powder bonded in plastic) saturate the marketplace, as
does synthetic turquoise.  Make sure you are buying ""genuine,
natural turquoise.""


THE DRESDEN DIAMOND: GREEN GLORY
=================================
The legendary 40.70 carat Dresden green diamond is now on
display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.,
right next to the Hope diamond, until January 10th of next
year--thanks to Ronald Winston, son of the 20th century's
most famous jewel merchant, Harry Winston.

Today the Dresden is to green diamonds what the Hope is to
blues; the most famous gem of its kind.  Estimated to have
lost at least 60 percent of its original 100-carat-plus
weight during cutting, this green giant takes the prize for
size as well as beauty.

Keep in mind that beauty in green diamonds is nothing like
beauty in emerald, jade, or green grossular garnet.  Natural
green diamonds are extremely uncommon occurrences, the result
of irradiation deep within the earth.  And when they are found,
most are pale in color and light in tone, running a hue
spectrum from apple to algae green.  Don't expect these
diamonds to sport stop light or shampoo-green colors.

Nevertheless, the Dresden is a marvel--from a standpoint of
both shading and size.  True, there are green diamonds
without the vibrancy muting gray of the Dresden, but their
far smaller size makes them seem tiny in comparison.  The
Dresden is such a behemoth, at least as far as green diamonds go,
that it sets a standard that will likely never be challenged,
let alone beat.

DO YOU WANT A COLORED GEMSTONE?
==================================
If you have ever wanted a gorgeous colored gemstone but
never knew how to find one, this is your chance to have one
hand picked for you.  In Tucson, Arizona during the first
weekend of February, the country's largest colored gem
trade show brings gem wholesalers from all over the world.
We will be attending the show to hand select the nicest
gems possible for our customers.

There are hundreds of booths of gems including: ruby, emerald,
sapphire, garnet, amethyst, tourmaline, jade, peridot,
spinel, and tanzanite.  If you would like us to add your
name to our shopping list, give us a call and tell us what
you are looking for. Every year we make many customers'
dreams come true as we find terrific values on the highest
quality gemstones in the world.


MEN'S WEDDING BANDS
======================
While there are hundreds, if not thousands, of women's
wedding ring style, there are relatively few common style of
men's rings.  The vast majority of men prefer some type of
comfort fit wedding band.  The term comfort fit comes from
the rounded inside of the ring that helps eliminate the
sharp edges.  Comfort bands come in a variety of finishes
including polished, two tone, hand craved, and milgrain
edges.

For men, the choice seems to focus more on the width of the
band which can range from 2 millimeters wide alll the way
up to 12 millimeters.  Sometimes couples decide to get
matching bands and/or rings but generally each will pick
what they think looks best and is most comfortable to them.

While the current trend is for the use of platinum in
women's wedding rings, men are often surprised how heavy and
expensive a wide man's band is if it is done in platinum.
Yellow and/or white gold is still the preferred metal for men.

Because men tend to wear their rings all the time, the rings
tend to take much more abuse than a women's ring.  A women
will take her ring off to wash her hands, do the dishes,
or fix dinner.  Men leave their rings on to mow the yard,
fix the car, or participate in sports.  This is probably
why you don't see many diamonds in men's wedding bands--
plus the fact that men learn early that most families
can only afford one jewelry lover.

DIAMOND DISTRICT DANGERS
=========================
When we visit with customers, we often hear that they are
contemplating making a trip to the diamond district in New
York to shop for a diamond.  Many people have heard of the
major diamond trading center located on 47th Street in New
York and the myth is that you can get a good deal there.
In reality, the wholesale trading takes place high above
the street in high-security offices hidden from the public.

The vendors on the street are more skilled at taking your
money than anyone you will find in your community.  They
are fast taking, high pressure salesman who specialize in
letting tourist think they are getting a deal.  They often
sell uncertified diamonds and reply on the difficulty of
customers returning to the Diamond District as part of
their sales strategy.

We recommend you never buy from anyone in the Diamond
District in New York unless you are there with a trusted
retailer who takes you to the true dealers who are not
at street level.  Don't become another statistic of one
who got ripped off while trying to get a good deal in
the Diamond District.


ONLY BUY THE CLARITY YOU NEED
=============================
We see more and more customers being told they need
VVS clarity or they will be able to see inclusions in the
their diamond.  Why pay for something you can not see?

For all shapes except emerald, we suggest VS2 or SI1
as your minimum clarity requirement since with an SI1 you
can not see anything with your naked eye.  The truth is
that you can not see the difference between SI1 and all
the higher clarity grades except with a microscope.
Higher clarity than SI1 does not add to beauty of the
diamond, only the rarity and therefore the price.  By
starting with an SI1 clarity you will get a bigger
diamond and have a better selection for getting a great
cut.  The highest clarity grades cost more but are not
necessarily going to appreciate as much as the grades in
most demand such as VS2 and SI1 as explained at
http://www.dsourceva.com/investment.htm on our web site.
The reality is that the first speck of dust that settles
on the diamond has much more visual impact on the beauty of
the diamond than anything in a diamond that is at least a
certified SI1 clarity grade.


50% OFF SALE
========================
You have all seen the billboards and newspaper ads
advertising half off sale at your local jeweler.  It is
not uncommon for stores to mark up items 300-500% so they
can mark them half-price during a sale. It's no great deal
if you are paying 50%, let alone 150% over wholesale.

Don't fall for sales of any kind.  If a dealer can afford
to mark it down, then they marked it up too high at the
start.


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:

FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name The Star of Sierra Leone
Weight: 968.90 carats rough

Valentine's Day, 1972.   A routine workday at the diamond
mine in Sierra Leone.  Suddenly, a company engineer and a
plant security officer spot something big on the grease table
(grease sticks to diamonds and is used to separate diamonds
from ore).  At first, neither man could believe what they
saw.  There, trapped by the grease, is a huge diamond, the
size of a hen's egg.

When the stone is first offered for sale, none of the sealed
bids reaches the minimum price of more than $2.5 million set
by the government.  Finally, months later, Harry Winston
makes a deal for the Star.  Winston wants a world-class
diamond from his rough.  A 143.20 carat emerald cut is
fashioned, but upon close examination, it reveals inclusions.
Winston changes his mind, deciding that flawlessness is
more important than size.

The big diamond is recut into seven smaller stones, the
largest of which weighs 32.52 carats.  Besides these, the
rough yields 10 other stones ranging from 1.85 to 53.96
carats.  All told, Winston recovers only 238.48 carats, a
staggering loss of almost 75 percent.  But 13 of the 17
finished stones are reportedly flawless.

GEM OF THE DAY
==================================
Keep smiling.  Even when life knocks you flat on your back,
you are still in a good position to look up.

BEWARE OF FRACTIONS
==================================
The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) allows jewelers to round
off diamond weights.  For example, a diamond labeled 3/4 carat
in weight might actually weigh anywhere between .69 and .81
carat.  While these are small weights, the price difference
can be significant.  For instance, if you bought earrings with
G color, SI1 clarity and 3/4 carat in each ear for $5160, you
might have over paid by $1600 if they really weight .69 carats.

Note: Jewelers are also allowed to be off one color and one
clarity grade.  If you don't purchase a certified diamond,
you could find yourself at the short end on weight, color,
clarity and therefore, value.

INTERNET SALES
==================================
Internet shoppers are expected to spend almost $20 billion
online during the 2000 holiday season, nearly double last
year's total of $10.5 billion, according to a recent survey by
the Gartner Interactive Firm.  About half that revenue is
expected to go to U.S. and Canadian e-tailers, with the rest
distributed among firms in Europe and Asia.

Robert Labatt, principal analyst for Gartner's e-Business
Services Unit, credits the increased willingness to do
business online to the e-tailers' extensive efforts in
increasing the customer's comfort level.  Chat rooms and
opportunities to interact with the internet firms are
encouraging more people to try this form of commerce.

DIAMOND GRADING TIPS: FLUORESCENCE
==================================
Fluorescence, if present in a diamond, will be indicated on
a diamond grading report.  It will be graded very faint,
faint, medium, strong, or very strong.  Some reports
indicate the color of fluorescence as blue, yellow, white,
and so on.  A stone with yellow fluorescence should sell
less since it will appear yellower than it really is when
worn in daylight or fluorescent lighting.  The presence of
blue fluorescence will not detract, and in some cases may
be considered a bonus since it may make the stone appear
whiter than it really is in daylight or fluorescent
lighting.  However, if there is very strong fluorescence,
there may be an oily or milky appearance to the diamond.
We recommend avoiding medium or strong fluorescence since
it is just not worth taking the chance of lower value.


BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS
=========================
One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and
fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books
listed at the following web page:

 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 
2-10.84 drip locations

The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above 
PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000.  

I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their 
C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs 
to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision 
is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done 
during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also 
need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology 
to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes 
to 36"".  

One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas 
compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were 
found at regulated levels.....

187,"Mike,  I reveiwed the proposal by Adewumi and it is correct and fairly 
accurate, for the purposes of a historic account and and in as far as  what 
was provided to him in the way of data and history.  His proposed scope seems 
to be conclusive and appears to be what we need.   I have included Louie in 
the distribution  and am sure he will have some input. 

My comments are as follows:

1.  I dont know how relevant it is to know about the customers facilities at 
this time.  As you know, we have more than one customer (PG&E and SoCal), and 
I  think that we should maintain a low profile especially with respect ot 
SoCal.  Both parties in the past,  have been helpful and very cooperative in 
matters  pertaining to PCB's. Because the modeling study will be conducted 
between C/S 3 and C/S 2, the customers facilities should have no impact on 
this.  

2.  Also, I would like to see if we can deal with  PCB's and arsenic at the 
same time?  Is it possible to simultanously model both contaminants?

3. Because the modeling efforts are conducted on a very small portion of the 
pipeline, can this section be used for all of the Transwestern system?  In 
leau of  the fact that we have pipe under rivers, over rivers, major 
elevation chages in short distances etc which are not covered in the section 
to be modeled, will  the pipeline characteristics be covered to the extent 
that it will yeild information applicable to the entire pipeline system?

4. I am also concerned about stirring up the PCB's and moving additional 
PCB's into the SoCal system.  Its been pretty quiet  in discussions with the 
SoCal  PCB person.  I wonder if we should notify Ralph Komai to be on the 
alert when we start the cleaning?  Louie, thoughts?

5. Injection of terpenol into the station yard piping.  How will we do this 
and how do we get it out?

6. Impact of terpenol on gaskets, engine parts, etc.

*PG&E <PCG.N> SAYS PACIFIC G&E FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 VOLUNTARY
BANKRUPTCY RELIEF


NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which is 
California's largest investor-owned utility and has been struggling with that 
state's power crisis, said on Friday it filed a voluntary petition for 
bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern 
District of California. 

Trading was halted in PG&E shares on the New York Stock Exchange before the 
filing. They last traded at $11.36, down 2 cents. 

The Chapter 11 filing was disclosed in mirror filings by the utility and its 
parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 

The utility said in the filing that it ""retains control of its assets and is 
authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession while being 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court."" 

A 1996 state utility law deregulated wholesale prices but capped retail 
prices. Pacific G&E has said it accumulated more than $8.9 billion of back 
debts because a rate freeze prevents it from passing on its soaring wholesale 
power costs to consumers.

economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than
anyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK,
Australia, and California.  He speaks a mile a minute though and his
understanding of policy and politics is a bit naive.

Sorry, I didn't realize we were attacking this one early over the holiday, 
and I was out of town
until this afternoon. My conclusions differed from the attached write up on a 
few points, but I am
not certain my thinking is the correct way. Here goes:

On the expropriation:

In the write up we say ""We agree with the executive that Global should report 
the expropriation
contingency in its 1994 report since both conditions included in FASB #5 were 
met:  1) sufficient
information to assess that a loss is probable and 2) the loss could be 
reasonably estimated.
Matuto took power in 1994 and it was known that he would nationalize major 
industries.  ""

The book says ""The imminence of an expropriation may be indicated by a public 
or private
declaration of intent by a government to expropriate assess of the enterprise 
or actual
expropriation of assets of other enterpises."" I would argue that Matuto was 
not the government and
therefore unable to enforce these assertions when he was running for office. 
It also says FASB 5
requires the two accrual criteria to be met.

As I understand it, the government took over sometime last year and 
nationalization of resources
was part of their platform. However, the announcement occured in mid-Feb 1995 
that the government
intends to nationalize the mining industry. Also, the taking over of the 
telephone company took
place in January. Since both of these events happened in 1995, I would think 
they should not accrue
in 1994 because the asset was not actually impaired in 1994, in fact the 
asset was fully functional
and operational for the entire financial reporting period. I believe they 
should disclose that the
possibility of expropriation exists in 1994, but I think they should not 
accrue..

I disagree that the company should cease use of the patent infringing 
technology, I believe that
companies frequently make conscious business decisions to infringe upon 
patents. Since I agree that
an accrual is not in order, perhaps a general disclosure regarding patent 
litigation should be
made.

The book states that ""If there are several aspects of litigation, each of 
which gives rise to a
possible claim, then the accrual criteria should be applied to each possible 
claim....""

Thus I think we should break up the product liability suit into pieces. 
They've agreed to pay 1M
for lost rentals. This should clearly be accrued, assuming it hasn't been 
paid yet. The tenants
claims are expected to be settled for 1M, this too should be accrued. The 
surrounding property
claims are not estimable, and therefore should be handled with a disclosure.

the arrangement we discussed, in which Enron would purchase SERVICE

though provision of the service would require building new facilities.

SECTION 251/252
NEW JERSEY
Bill sets market share test for promoting local competition

Sen. Robert W. Singer (R., District 30) has introduced SB 1522 to
""establish conditions necessary for genuine competition to develop in
the local exchange telephone market.""  The measure lays out standards
and procedures that would apply to each incumbent local exchange carrier
(ILEC) until its market share in its local service territory declined to
50% or below.

The Board of Public Utilities would have to hold a ""cost-of-service""
hearing within 45 days of the law's effective date to determine an
ILEC's actual service costs, including costs of providing unbundled
network elements to competitors.  In analyzing costs, the BPU would have
to use ""parameters consistent with those established by the FCC.""

The BPU would have to hold subsequent cost-of-service hearings every two
years to provide for appropriate rate adjustments.  After each hearing,
the ILECs would have to file new rate tariffs with the BPU to reflect
""actual costs of service, plus an authorized rate of return up to a
maximum of 10%.""  The bill includes provisions to make sure ""ILECs offer
to lease network elements to competing local exchange carriers [CLECs]""
and ""otherwise conduct their business in nondiscriminatory ways with
regard to CLECs.""

""Immediately following"" the law's effective date, the BPU would have to
order full testing of the ILEC's operations support systems (OSSs).  The
board couldn't certify an OSS as functional unless the testing
""unequivocally"" demonstrated that it met the same standards as required
for systems used for switched interexchange service.  The OSS would have
to pass a 90-day commercial availability test before certification.

After the initial hearing, switched access rates would have to be
reduced to cost.  Unless cost data supported higher rates, the BPU would
have to set access rates at no higher than $.008 per minute for local
switching charges and $.00175 per minute for originating and terminating
nontraffic-sensitive switched usage rates.

Another provision of the bill deems local calls to Internet service
provider to be ""local call[s] for reciprocal compensation purposes.""

The bill aims to protect consumers by directing the BPU to establish a
universal service fund (USF) that would be funded by all telephone
service providers.  The USF would provide discounted service for
eligible schools and libraries and provide support for service in
high-cost areas.  The measure would require creation of a Lifeline
service program.

The BPU would have to develop comprehensive performance standards,
reporting requirements, service quality measurements, and enforcement
mechanisms to ensure that service isn't degraded, and competitors aren't
disadvantaged in the competitive marketplace.

SB 1522 has been referred to the Commerce Committee.  An identical
version (AB 3122) sponsored by Assemblywoman Rose Marie Heck (R.,
District 38) has been introduced in the Assembly.  The text of SB 1522
is available at
http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2000/Bills/s2000/1522_i1.htm.

URC to investigate Ameritech service quality

The Utility Regulatory Commission yesterday opened a formal
investigation of Ameritech-Indiana's service quality.  The commission
acknowledged that the company's service quality has improved during the
last few months but said it's concerned that during 2000 the company
didn't meet service quality standards required by law.  The URC said its
investigation will require Ameritech to ""convince the commission why
enforcement action should not be taken.""

According to the URC, Ameritech doesn't comply with the state law
requirement to restore all service outages within 24 hours of the time
they're reported.  (170 IAC 7-1.1-11(E)(1))  Ameritech managed to comply
with the requirement just 85.3% of the time during the first quarter of
2000, 81.4% of the time during the second quarter, and 66.2% during the
third quarter.

The URC said Ameritech's performance falls short of compliance with the
state law requirement that it fulfill at least 90% of all requests for
new primary service in any month within 5 days.  (170 IAC
7-1.1-11(A)(2))  Ameritech complied with the standard 86% of the time
during first quarter 2000, 85.5% during the second quarter, and 88.6%
during the third quarter.

It said Ameritech also fails to meet the standard requiring it to make
all reasonable efforts to provide adequate personnel so that under
normal operating conditions, at least 80% of calls to business office
and repair service are answered within 20 seconds after the beginning of
a ring, the URC said.  Ameritech's average response to answer phone
calls in 2000 ranged from a low of 62.5 seconds in January to a high of
222.7 seconds in August, it said.

MISSOURI
Bill targets Web sites that force computers to dial long distance
numbers

Sen. John Loudon (R., District 7) has proposed a bill to prohibit Web
site operators from causing users' computers to dial long distance
numbers without informing the users.  SB 70 would add a new section to
Chapter 570, RSMo.

Web site operators who violated the new section could be charged with a
""class A"" misdemeanor if related long distance charges were $150 or
less.  If the charges totaled more than $150, the Web site operator
could be charged with a ""class C"" felony.

SB 70 has been referred to the Civil and Criminal Jurisprudence
Committee.  Its text is available at

MONTANA
Committee OKs Uniform Electronic Transactions Act

The state House Business and Labor Committee has approved a Uniform
Electronic Transaction Act to prohibit anyone from denying legal effect
or enforceability to a record or signature solely because it's in
electronic form.  (1/3/01 p.m.)

Each government agency would be able to determine whether and to what
extent it would send and accept electronic records and electronic
signatures.  The committee amended the bill to state that government
agencies wouldn't be limited to specific types of technologies.

HB 234 states that electronic signatures would be valid only if all
parties agreed to conduct a transaction electronically.  If a party
agreed to conduct one transaction by electronic means, the party could
refuse to conduct other transactions electronically.  This right to opt
out of electronic transactions couldn't be waived.

Secretary of State Mike Cooney (D.) is the sponsor of HB 234, which
awaits consideration on the House floor.

SECTION 251/252
INDIANA
URC gives interim approval to parts of Ameritech UNE tariff

The Utility Regulatory Commission yesterday gave interim approval to the
terms and conditions portion of Ameritech-Indiana's proposed unbundled
network element (UNE) tariff.  The interim approval is subject to
challenge in a formal pleading by any competitive local exchange
carrier, other party to the case, or the commission's own motion to
investigate a specific term or condition.  The URC gave final approval,
however, to the tariff's rates and charges..

The URC said it's concerned that ""a tariff containing finally approved
terms and conditions may become not only the minimum conditions for
interconnection but also the maximum conditions any CLEC can negotiate.
We believe this result would improperly limit future negotiations
between [incumbent local exchange carriers] and CLECs to limit the
choice available under section 252 of [the federal Telecommunications
Act of 1996].""

The commission said it isn't sure how an interconnection agreement and
an interconnection service arrangement that is tariffed would interact.
For example, the URC questioned whether a CLEC could have an
interconnection agreement but still buy interconnection services out of
a tariff.

SECTION 251/252
CALIFORNIA
PUC approves interim performance assessment plan

The Public Utilities Commission has approved an interim performance
assessment plan for Pacific Bell and Verizon California, Inc., that
seeks to identify and prevent or remove any barriers to telecom
competition.  The federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires all
incumbent local exchange carriers to provide competing carriers access
to the incumbent's infrastructure, such as operation support systems
(OSSs).

Within the plan, the PUC created a set of procedures for assessing the
performance measurement results to identify competitive barriers.  The
commission also concluded that the interim pilot test period would
assist the PUC in determining the appropriate levels of long-term
economic incentives.

The plan's details are available at

PUC wants contested cases to go to appeals court

The Public Utility Commission has sponsored a bill to remove one layer
from the process parties encounter when contesting a PUC decision.  HB
2179 would require all cases challenging PUC decisions to go straight to
the appeals court, rather than first going to the circuit court and then
to the appeals court.  The PUC staff told TR that most public utility
commissions already operate in this manner.

The staff said that in supporting the legislation, the commission wants
to accelerate the review process and reduce unnecessary steps and
costs.  The staff said eliminating the circuit court level could make
for a more ""stable"" environment.

HB 2179 also could help the Marion County Circuit Court, which receives
the majority of cases contesting PUC decisions.  According to the PUC
staff, the circuit court is asking the county for more money, in part
because of all the cases it receives from the commission.  The
commission's headquarters is located in Marion County.

Senate passes bill keeping '911' fund interest 'in the system'

The state Senate has approved SB 112 to allow any interest earned on
funds deposited into a ""911"" account to be retained by the 911 system,
rather than being lumped into the state's general funds.  (12/19/00
p.m.)

According to a fiscal note on SB 112, the bill would conform the
statutes to current practice.  The measure, which was introduced by Sen.
Linda Nelson (D., District 49), awaits committee referral in the House.

URC seeks comment on scope of UNE proceeding

The Utility Regulatory Commission has requested comments by Feb. 2 on
unbundled network element (UNE) issues it should address in a new
subdocket.  Replies are due Feb. 16.

The commission opened the subdocket in August 2000 to address the issue
of line sharing.  Covad Communications Co. and Rhythms Links, Inc., had
asked the URC to address the issue in its investigation of
Ameritech-Indiana's proposed UNE tariff, but the commission found it
wasn't appropriate to address it within that investigation.

The URC also has set other issues aside for the docket, such as shared
transport and loop conditioning.  (Cause no. 40611-S1 - In the Matter of

ARKANSAS
Rep. Hunt seeks to clarify computer crime law

Rep. Russ Hunt (R., District 68) has introduced HB 1231 to amend the
state's computer crime law to define terms such as ""computer virus"" and
""aggravated computer trespass.""  It would amend Arkansas Code 5-41-102.

The amendment would define a computer virus as ""any computer
instruction, information, data or program that degrades the performance
of a computer resource; disables, damages or destroys a computer
resource; or attaches itself to another computer resource and executes
when the host computer program, data or instruction is executed or when
some other event takes place in the host computer resource, data or
instruction.""

Aggravated computer trespass would be defined as the willful
introduction of a virus into a computer system or the dissemination of a
password or other sensitive computer-related information.  HB 1231 would
classify aggravated computer trespass as a ""class D"" felony.

The bill would specify the damages that a computer crime victim could
seek.  The term ""damages"" would include profits lost while a computer
system was down, the cost of restoring data, and the expenses incurred
in fixing or replacing any affected parts of the system.

HB 1231 has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.  Its full

PUC to hold hearings on '614' area code relief proposals

The Public Utilities Commission yesterday scheduled two hearings for
Feb. 7 to receive public comment on proposals to relieve exhaustion of

the second is scheduled for 7 p.m.  Both will be held at the PUC's
offices in Columbus.

The ""614"" area code relief planning team has proposed either an
all-services ""overlay"" or a geographic ""split"" to relieve NXX code
exhaustion.  Under the geographic split option, all the exchanges
surrounding the Columbus exchange would be on one side, and only the
Columbus exchange would be on the other.  (Case no. 00-1260-TP-COI - In

True Orange Crystal Ball Shows 2001 Season
Will Be Longhorns' Break-Through Year

My crystal ball was a little faulty last year because it didn't show TE Bo
Scaife going down for the season in the first pre-season practice.
Without that important piece of data, I predicted the Longhorns would win a=
t
least 10 regular season games.
They won nine without Scaife and I think they would have won 10 with him
because the Stanford loss came before the great freshmen wide receivers
became the go-to guys on the team.
I'm more confident this year because the Longhorns are deeper and even more
talented than they were last season, so I'm going to go way out on a limb a=
nd
predict the 2001 season will be remembered as the one we all will recall as
the Horns' ""break-through"" year.
By that, I mean I think they will break into the top 10 and stay there for
years and years.
Since the Longhorns haven't finished in the top 10 since 1982, that sounds
like a tall order for this team.
This will be coach Mack Brown's fourth team at Texas and it should be his
best one by far.
His fourth recruiting class will enroll in September, and it will be his
third straight great one. that means the first group of great recruits will
be starting their third years. They will be juniors or redshirt sophomores.
The third year normally is one when players who have been able to play at a
high level at times learn how to play at a high level consistently.
This team will have some flaws, but every team has flaws. The great teams
simply have enough great players to win in spite of their flaws.
The Longhorns have offensive weapons that are almost off the chart. With a
healthy Scaife, who is that rarity at TE =01) a swift, sure-handed guy who =
can
turn a six-yard pass into an 80-yard score =01) to go along with
sophomores-to-be Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson, who broke every Longhorn
freshman receiving record last year.
When a team has an awesome tight end, and Scaife is one of those, with
sophomore Brock Edwards not too far behind, it creates match-up problems fo=
r
any defense.
Linebackers normally cover tight ends, and good tight ends, even one who
aren't really fast, usually win those matchups. Fast tight ends who can cat=
ch
in a crowd usually draw coverage from a safety.
But then Williams and Johnson create problems because Williams almost alway=
s
draws double coverage and Johnson is a huge threat to go all the way if one
safety is worrying about Scaife and the other one is helping out on William=
s.
QB Chris Simms seems to be developing into the great player he was expected
to be after all the recruiting services tabbed him as the No. 1 prospect in
the country when he was a senior in high school.
The obvious solution for a defensive coordinator would be to play five or s=
ix
defensive backs most of the time or to go to a zone defense.
But Brown says the Horns will be a better running team than they have been
since Ricky Williams departed, and a more experienced line and a bigger
tailback should make that happen.
Hodges Mitchell was a great little tailback, but this offense is designed
primarily to pass or run between the tackles.
When you want to run between the tackles, it helps to have a big, powerful
tailback.
The tailback this season, whether it is one of the returnees or heralded
recruit Cedric Benson, will be bigger and more powerful than Mitchell.
The line was a good pass-blocking unit last year, and with four of the five
guys back, it should be much better this year.
The only big question about the offense will be one of consistency. When
Simms, who shared time with Major Applewhite last season, was at the helm,
the team often had long, long dry spells.
In the 43-17 victory over Texas A&M, for example, what most people remember
is the Longhorns' four-touchdown explosion in the third quarter.
But I remember being scared silly at the half because the offense had made
only one first down in the entire half and the defense was showing signs of
tiring because of all those 3-and-outs.
And that was not an unusual happening. In the bowl loss to Oregon, Simms to=
ok
the Longhorns on long back-to-back scoring drives in the second quarter, bu=
t
the Horns generated little offense in the first and third quarters.
I could cite other examples, because there are plenty to cite, but Simms is=
 a
year older and wiser and so are the receivers, who performed better last
season than any of us have a right to expect true freshmen to perform.
A bigger, stronger tailback also will be able to pick up more of those
third-and-short downs than the team did last year.
Defensively, eight starters return from an outstanding unit.
The Longhorns lost two great defensive tackles, but the power teams in the
Southern Division of the Big 12 rely a lot more on the pass than they do on
the run, and the tackles UT will play this year are quicker and might suppl=
y
a better pass rush.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also made several position changes in the
spring that are certain to generate a better pass rush.
If you remember the Oregon game, the Ducks used quick, undersized linemen t=
o
harass Simms and it worked remarkably well most of the time.
With former DE Maurice Gordon now a super quick DT, and former OLB O. J.
McClintock now a super quick DE, look for the Longhorns to be a much better
pass rushing team in 2001.
I do worry a lot about the Horns' place-kicking, but the coaches are bringi=
ng
in several walk-ons and, hopefully, one of them can kick off into the end
zone and make most of the 40-yard field goals.
Even if the kicking problems aren't solved, this is a team with enough
weapons, offensively and defensively, to be a top 10 team.
No one in the college ranks will be better or deeper at the receiving
positions, particularly when the tight ends are added to the mix, and few
teams will have better defensive secondaries.
The offensive line will be one of the best pass-blocking lines in the Big 1=
2,
and the defensive line, despite having two new tackles, also will be one of
the league's best.
Here's the way I see the Big 12 South race winding up, and, briefly, why I
place each team at its particular spot:
1. Texas - Too many big play guys for the other teams to stop.
2. Oklahoma - Defending national champs could do it again if they can find
another great QB.
3. Texas Tech - Big passing game too tough for everyone in South but Texas
and Oklahoma.
4. Texas A&M - Even R. C. Slocum says the Ags ""will not dazzle anyone with
talent.""
5. Oklahoma State - Team has too many holes and too tough a schedule to do
any better.
6. Baylor - Bears still find Big 12 a tough row to hoe with little offense
and overworked defense.
Nebraska should win the North, mainly because the Huskers host the big game
with Kansas State.
The Southern Division teams have beaten the North three times in the five
championship games and I think Texas or Oklahoma will make it four this yea=

The  South is a lot stronger than the folks =01) and particularly the pundi=

UT Starts Another Great Recruiting Year with First Pledge

The Longhorns have three great recruiting classes in succession, and they
made a good start on a fourth earlier this month when outstanding Brownwood
junior OL Bret Valdez. 6-4, 310, 5.1, confirmed he has committed to the UT
coaches.
Valdez, one of the state's great run blockers, said he went to the UT sprin=
g
game March 31 and really liked what he saw.
He said the Texas coaches offered him a scholarship  at the spring game.
""They told me I was the first offensive lineman they have offered this year=
""
he said, adding that he went home and talked to his parents about it and
decided he wanted to be a Longhorn.
He said he came to Austin the weekend after the spring game and  competed i=
n
the Texas Relays, throwing the shot and discus.
"" After I was through competing,"" he said, ""I went over to the coaches'
offices and talked to coach (Mack) Brown and coaches (Tim) Nunez and (Mike)
Tolleson and told them I was ready to commit. I'm really excited about bein=
g
a Longhorn.""
He said he also was being recruited by about 20 other schools including
Florida State, Texas A&M, Oklahoma, Alabama and Notre Dame.
""The first time they can come see us is in May and Florida State, A&M, OU,
Notre Dame and Alabama coaches had all told my coach they were going to com=
e
down and see me then.""
But he said they need to change their travel plans because he is firmly
committed to the Longhorns and will tell any other coaches who contact him
that he is a future Longhorn.
""Texas has really been recruiting well every year and I think they have a
great shot at winning a national championship in the next year or two,"" he
said. ""I like the way they emphasize academics, too.""
""I think I'll have a good chance to start after a redshirt year,"" he said.
The Longhorns probably will sign only three offensive line prospects next
February, and the coaches have not offered scholarships to any other
offensive line prospects I have been talking to, so they must consider Vald=
ez
to be the state's top OL prospect.
Brownwood went 11-2 last year, and Valdez was the team's top blocker. He ha=
s
thrown the shot 53 feet and discus 162-7.
On tape, Valdez is a very aggressive blocker who has an explosive start tha=
t
allows him to make quick contact and then he simply drives his guy backward=
.
He has the quickest start of any of the big offensive line prospects I have
seen this year.
One of the best things about him is that he is only 16 and won't turn 17
until June 15, but he already benches 320 and squats 600.
* * * *
The Longhorns need a bumper crop of defensive linemen this year, and they
stand a very good chance to get an early commitment from one of the top one=
s
around at their early June camp.
He is Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, of Scottsdale Chaparral, a top DT who i=
s
the No. 1 recruit in Arizona.
Sendlein is the son of former UT and NFL LB Robin Sendlein, and he is the
brother of UT redshirt freshman LB Austin Sendlein.
I talked to Sendlein Sunday and he told me he is coming to the June 4
Longhorn camp.
I asked him if he is planning on going to any other camps this summer.
""It depends on what happens at the Texas camp,"" he said. ""I might commit. I
really like Texas.""
He said he also is being recruited by Notre Dame, Arizona, UCLA, Arizona
State, USC and ""about 15 other schools.
* * * *
Another top DT prospect who is a strong Texas lean is Kasey Studdard, 6-2,
260, 4.8, of Highlands Ranch, Colo.
He is the son of David Studdard, a former UT offensive line star who starte=
d
for the Denver Broncos for about 10 years after his career at Texas.
Studdard told me Sunday he probably isn't going to go to any summer camps,
but he said, ""I really like Texas."" He said other schools recruiting him
include Colorado, Colorado State, Nebraska, Washington, USC and Missouri.
His sister, Katie, recently accepted a basketball scholarship at Northern
Colorado.
* * * *
DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster, who has thrown the shot nearly 61 feet, says
he is bigger and also a little bit faster than I have him listed.
""I'm 6-4 1/2, 270 and I run a 4.68 40,"" he said. He's also an honor student
who carries a 3.6 GPA on a 4.0 scale and has already made a qualifying scor=
e
on the SAT.
""I want to take it again to try to do better, but I've already made a
qualifying score,"" he said.
When I asked him if he plans to go to any camps this summer, Dibbles said,
""I'm going to the Nike camp at A&M and a Texas camp, probably in late June.=
 I
might go to one more camp, maybe at Oklahoma.""
He said Oklahoma, LSU, TCU and SMU have already offered him a scholarship,
and said other schools recruiting him include UT, Notre Dame, A&M, Purdue,
Florida and Nebraska.
When asked what he is looking for in a school, he said, ""Academics has to b=
e
first. I want to major in something in the engineering or computer range.
""I also want to know about the graduation rate for football players. The
coaches are important, too, and the chance to get playing time.""
He said he went to the Longhorn coaches' offices after competing in the Tex=
as
Relays and met with head coach Mack Brown, DE coach Hardee McCrary and RB
coach Bruce Chambers, who recruits the Lancaster area.
""It was nice in Austin,"" he said. ""I'm pretty interested in Texas.""
He also said he thinks Lancaster has a chance to make a good run in the
playoffs this year. ""We got to the third round last year and lost to Ennis,=
""
he said. ""Ennis won state and we had a lot of young players, so we think we
have a chance to do better this year.""
* * * *
Some of the top football players in the state are also some of the top trac=
k
performers.
UT CB signee Michael Huff  won the District 7-5A sprints in 10.69 and 21.68
and anchored the 400-meter relay to victory in 41.32.
Another Longhorn CB recruit, Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, won the
District 27-5A hurdles in 13.75 and 37.76. He also placed fourth in the
triple jump with a 42-3 leap.
There are always a lot of regional qualifier meets between the district and
regional meets and junior RB DaBryan Blanton of Forney had some great times
at the one in Glen Rose Friday, running a 10.1 100 meters and 20.7 200
meters. UT WR recruit Quan Cosby of Mart was second in both races, running
10.5 and 21.18.
Junior RB/CB Edorian McCullough of North Garland, who is undefeated in the
dashes this year, ran 10.36 and 20.89 and anchored his 400-meter relay team
to a win in 41.07 in a regional qualifer meet in Mansfield. Huff was second
in the 200 in 21.54 and third in the 100 in 10.55.
UT LB recruit Derrick Johnson ran a 10.79 for third place in the 100 in a
regional qualifiers meet in McGregor. He has run a 10.6 this year.","Jerry Scarbrough's TE Bo

Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week, although the Minneapolis Star-Tribune says he might have to throw in pain.

Foster (thigh) might not be able to play this week. Bert Emanuel may take his place as Detroit's No. 2 receiver. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 12/20/01
Stewart (hip) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1186&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Emanuel returned to practice on Wednesday. If his knee shows no sign of swelling, he should play this week, says the Detroit Free Press. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Shea did not participate in team drills on Wednesday. He is not expected to play this week, and O.J. Santiago will start in his place. 

Scott Mitchell <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1025&> , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Mitchell strained his right rib cage on Wednesday. He is doubtful for Sunday's game, and now Kevin Thompson will back up Jon Kitna, who is expected to start although he still has a finger injury. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Walls (ankle) particpated in some drills on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable, and Kris Mangum will start in Walls' place if he cannot play. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/20/01

Allen is ready to assume a larger workload, says the Baltimore Sun. He may start against the Bengals this week. ""I expect to see more time but I'm still not 100 percent,"" Allen said. ""My hand is going to bother me but I need to be out there on the field to help this team.""

Elvis Grbac <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick told the Baltimore Sun. ""He's my quarterback now, he's going to be my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after that,"" Billick said. ""The only thing that would change that is if he chooses to retire or God forbid, he'd get a career-ending injury."" 

Chris Chandler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Chandler won't have too look over his shoulder this week. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Michael Vick will not see action unless Chandler is injured. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/20/01

Ricky Watters <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01

Griese should be able to return from a concussion after the bye week. Jarious Jackson will be Denver's No. 2 QB. 

Joe Jurevicius <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. 

Travis Henry <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 12/19/01

Dwight (fluid in lung) is not expected to play this week. He has not produced very much this year when healthy.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 12/19/01
Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams. 

Derrick Mason <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=792&key=1816&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Jay Fiedler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 12/29/01
Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start. If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start. 

Larry Foster <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1186&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/29/01
Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. 

Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place. 

Spergon Wynn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=187690&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. 

Drew Bledsoe <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01
Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.

Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload. 

James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week. 

Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1321&>, TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week. 

Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=188183&>, RB ATL - Frank Updated 12/28/01
A banged-up Smith Toe/knee) will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback. 

Bob Christian <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1077&> , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01
Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay. Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman.

Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day.""

Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the club wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.

Mark,
Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement.    I was wondering if Ercot had made a decision on OOM capacity payments.
Our position is that our custmers,  ie.   Teco/Frontera   should recover at least their O&M expenses for the capacity,  as they are standing by awaiting instruction.

Has there been any progress in this subject?

JForney",Mark Ercot,,OOM O&M
318,"

Due to the slowdown in trading,   I will be concentrating on leaving positions for RT to trade around.    
These will keep you in the market and give some flexibilty and decision making responsibility.    This will make more sense,  once you inherit the position.

The following positions need to be watched for monday:

1.     We are short to Mirant (on behalf of Frontera) for hour ending 6 only.     We need to buy 50 mw's and schedule this with Mirant Real Time.     
They are expecting and have agreed to this trade.   This is energy that Frontera owes them on a prescheduled basis.

If you are working Sunday night,   check in early with Mirant to make sure they are aware of this trade.   It is very common that they get a bad ""handoff"" and are unaware of this transaction.     Give them plenty of time to work this out.

We schedule this in the portal as a buy from X  and a sale to Mirant.    In Enpower,  buy from X and sell to Frontera (under the Teco Services book).   Enter this as a flat transaction,  ie buy for $20 and sell to Frontera for $20.


2.    The Ercot Asset book is long 5 mw's for offpeak Monday at $11.25.    Sell this or leave to the pool, as necessary.     I will be long this power offpeak for the balance of next week 10/16-19.     



I think that Saturday morning will come in strong, as we are getting some cooler weather.    I think also that some larger units are coming off line,  which will put upward pressure on the offpeak.


Each member of the group needs to tell me what positions they want.       Next day onpeak is trading for $20.5,  offpeak is trading $11.25.     
Where is the value???   Lets  trade it up!

Allegheny Expands Growing Generation Portfolio with Solar Energy
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Allegheny Energy Solutions, an unregulated subsidiary of Allegheny Energy,
Inc., has added Siemens Solar Industries, L.P., to its growing portfolio
of suppliers for distributed generation products. Through its new agreement
with Siemens Solar Industries, Allegheny Energy Solutions will provide
its customers with a comprehensive offering of solar electric solutions
called earthsafe =01v. The systems are suited for industrial, commercial an=
d
residential applications. The new partnership further advances Allegheny's
strategy of becoming a national energy supplier.

ANALYSIS: This partnership comes on the heels of Allegheny's recently=20
announced
agreement to purchase three gas-fired merchant plants from Enron North
America. Both deals reaffirm Allegheny's intent to expand its geographic
footprint and strengthen the scope of its unregulated generation capability=
.
In my opinion, Allegheny is one of a handful of companies that have further=
ed
very aggressive generation expansion plans this year, announcing one=20
acquisition
or development after another. The company has added seven new offices in
the northeastern United States over the last year, and has disclosed that
it will open new offices in the Southeast in 2001 to begin preparing for
the albeit slow move to competition in that region.

The partnership with Siemens is particularly interesting as it indicates
that Allegheny believes solar power will become a significant part of its
service offerings. Siemens Solar is one competitive business in Siemens'
portfolio of companies, specializing in high and medium voltage, protection
and substation control systems, power and distribution transformers, system
planning, and decentralized energy supply systems.  Siemens Solar claims
to be the number one provider of solar-power solutions in the world, having
shipped solar cells and modules with a cumulative peak power of 200 MW.
The company has been in business for about 20 years, and reached a mileston=
e
of 100 MW in 1996. Thus, the company has doubled its production output
in just four years.

Siemens Solar offers an array of solar-related products. As noted, Alleghen=
y
Energy Solutions will be adopting Siemen's earthsafe platform which, accord=
ing
to information on Siemen's Website, is offered in four models ranging in
DC power from 300 watts to 1,200 watts. The earthsafe system consists of
solar modules, universal roof mounting kits, DC/AC inverters, and interconn=
ect
hardware. The intent is that businesses and residences would install the
earthsafe system to supply a portion of their energy needs (the remainder
supplied by more traditional means) and contribute to the efforts of reduci=
ng
emissions from fossil fuel plants. Allegheny Energy Solutions claims that
the addition of the Siemens' product to its service offerings positions
it as one of the only suppliers of distributed generation products to offer
a complete on-site power solution.

I think that this is a smart move for Allegheny to take as it certainly
diversifies the company's service offerings. Although the jury is still
out regarding the profitability of solar power, along with other forms
of distributed and renewable energy sources, for Allegheny the move makes
sense as it attempts to offer on a national scale a full package of energy
solutions. Allegheny Energy Supply, where most of the generation expansion
efforts of its parent are focused, develops competitive generation solution=
s
(e.g., cogeneration, green power, etc.) for a variety of end users. Within
the last year, Allegheny Energy Solutions has made great strides in moving
from a regional player into a national energy supplier, resulting primarily
from its success in the strong Northeast market.

This venture into solar continues a decided focus on distributed generation
on the part of the unregulated company. Earlier this year, Allegheny Energy
Solutions formed a partnership with Capstone Turbine Corporation under
which the Capstone MicroTurbine was installed at Allegheny Energy's Mitchel=
l
Power Station in New Eagle, Pa. Allegheny Energy Solutions is providing
technical and economic analysis of the unit for the customers of its parent
company. This was a very strategic partnership for Allegheny as it makes
the company one of the few system integrators of the Capstone MicroTurbine
in the Northeast.

The diversification of Allegheny's generation arsenal is also important
because it gives the company a possible edge over direct competitors.=20
Allegheny
must surely know that companies like Dominion, Reliant and AES=01*just to
name a few=01*are also aggressively stacking up generation assets in key ar=
eas
across the country. Thus, by adding diverse power options to its service
offerings, Allegheny conceivably will have more to offer customers in its
energy supply packages. I observed several months ago that Allegheny was
probably in search of a unique niche to set itself apart from other compani=
es
that are strong in generation. This partnership with Siemens seems to indic=
ate
that distributed generation, including solar power, could become that niche=
.

As a sidenote, Allegheny Energy was just added to Standard & Poor's 500
Index earlier this week. So, the announcement that the company is diversify=
ing
into solar power comes at a time when, as CEO Alan Noia puts it, ""our stron=
g
growth strategy and resulting solid financial performance"" have received
recognition. The S&P 500 Index is widely regarded as the standard for=20
measuring
large-capitalization U.S. stock market performance. As of yesterday (Dec.
7), Allegheny Energy's stock (NYSE: AYE) was priced at $42 5/16.

The only red flag that I can determine for this deal relates to Siemens,
not Allegheny Energy Solutions. Competition among companies that develop
products related to solar power has become pretty fierce as of late, and
there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the profitability
of this market. One direct competitor to Siemens that I've tracked recently
is Evergreen Solar, a company whose String Ribbon technology reportedly
cuts in half the required use of silicon, which is needed for most solar-po=
wer
technologies. Evergreen Solar, which recently became a publicly traded
company, has acknowledged that its own market prospects are uncertain and
that it may never become a profitable company.

The same market conditions apply to Siemens Solar Industries, so the compan=
y
may have a difficult time in finding wide application for its solar power
units. This is, of course, an issue for Siemens, and not Allegheny, to
address. Under its partnership with Siemens, Allegheny attains all the
value of solar power technologies and little of the risks. Thus, this appea=
rs
to be a smart venture for Allegheny and one that should strongly benefit
its power supply opportunities.

342,"Anonymous Letters Put UtiliCorp in Hot Water

Investigations in several states are getting under way into alleged illegal 
profit-taking by UtiliCorp United in Missouri, Michigan, Nebraska, Minnesota 
and Iowa. An anonymous letter from someone who claimed to be a current 
employee for UtiliCorp was sent to state regulators alleging the company's 
Gas Supply Service Department (GSS) took part in improper actions in 
reselling natural gas to customers in these states. 

""Personnel are paid bonuses based on the value that can be extracted from 
managing the assets paid for by the Missouri Public Service (MPS) 
ratepayers,"" the letter said. The anonymous author said that value is 
extracted in numerous ways that are undetectable to staff audit efforts. One 
method included in the letter was for UtiliCorp employees to sell a first of 
the month ""put"" to suppliers, invoicing the put premium on a separate invoice 
that would never be included in audited documentation. If prices drop, the 
supplier puts first of the month gas to MPS. 

Another scheme alleged in the letter includes capacity releases. ""Operations 
personnel extract one-to-two cents per release by doing buy-sells with MPS 
capacity, instead of doing a posted release,"" said the letter. ""They look at 
the lowest credit amount possible to report, instead of maximizing the 
capacity release credit."" The anonymous author speculated that these actions 
are taken to reach the unit's lofty profit goal of $10 million. ""Due to the 
emphasis on earnings, GSS's top priority is earnings, not providing 
efficient, reliable, economic gas supplies,"" the author concluded. 

Jerry Cosley, a UtiliCorp United spokesperson said, ""We can say without 
qualification, that in no way would we approve of any improper behavior or 
business practice, so we are conducting our own review."" 

Missouri appears to be the first state out of the gate on the investigation 
trail as the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission has recommended 
an investigation be conducted into the allegations. An MPS representative 
said that UtiliCorp denied the allegations of impropriety, but supports the 
staff's request to open an investigation. 

Iowa's Consumer Advocate is investigating the UtiliCorp charges in that 
state, said Chuck Seel, a spokesman for the Iowa Utilities Board. Seel said 
the Iowa and Minnesota letters, and the Michigan and Missouri letters, 
appeared to be similar to one another. He added that an observer from the IUB 
and a representative of the Consumer Advocate will attend a meeting next week 
with UtiliCorp to discuss the situation. 

Cosley said UtiliCorp intends to conduct its own internal review, and would 
stay in touch with all of the affected regulatory commissions and report its 
findings to them.

346,"Per Louie Soldano, I called Dave Sinclair (GPG ROW) about whether we have any 
ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the BNSF railroad.  
In Dave's experience, that is a nonstarter.  Apparently, a bunch of 
utilities, including us through Dave, have even formed a coalition to try to 
figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative.  If the RR owns 
its ROW outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be 
able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate.  In other words, 
the RR would be treated just like any other landowner.  If we did that, Dave 
thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war.  Since our lines cross or 
parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth, that 
would be foolish.  

I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was 
interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW 
without too much pain.  If the RR option doesn't pan out, we may want to 
suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this.  Assuming we 
can't come up with some magic contact with the RR, I propose that, at the 
appropriate time,  we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW 
should be flagged as a potential problem that Enron can help resolve once we 
decide to go forward.

Witnesses from the Energy Information Administration, American Gas

Basically, the hearing provided an opportunity for Western State Senators to

The bottom line is that a number of Senators are deploring the lack of a

create incentives to encourage pipleine investment.  He seemed especially

Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants; Match for Entergy
in New York
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Constellation Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy,
and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced
that Constellation Nuclear will buy 100 percent of Unit 1 and 82 percent
of Unit 2. Constellation will own a total of 1,550 MW of Nine Mile Point's
1,757 MW of total generating capacity. The total purchase price, including
fuel, is $815 million. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclea=
r
Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the New York Public Utilities Commission
still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase, but Constellation
Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid-2001.

ANALYSIS: This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever=
al
reasons. First, the purchase of the plants expands Constellation's generati=
on
assets, which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the
last year. Secondly, the location of the plants is a critical factor.=20
Constellation
has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region, and New
York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing
field for nuclear assets. Third, owning the Nine Mile Point plants will
elevate Constellation's stature, moving it ever close to become on par
with its nearest competitor in the New York market, Entergy Corp.

Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move
for Constellation Nuclear, let me establish some of the important factors
of the deal. Nine Mile Point is a two-unit boiling water reactor site.
Nine Mile 1 began producing electricity in 1969; Nine Mile 2 began producin=
g
electricity in 1988. The two units are both located in Scriba, N.Y., which
is about 40 miles north of Syracuse. The Nine Mile Point units have had
rather spotty histories, but over the last two years have shown signs of
becoming strong performers. Niagara Mohawk operates both units.

Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several
different utility owners. Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of
Unit 1. Unit 2 is owned by a group of co-owners: Niagara Mohawk (41 percent=
),
New York State Electric & Gas (18 percent), Rochester Gas & Electric=20
Corporation
(14 percent), and Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation (9 percent).
It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase
82 percent of Unit 2 because the Long Island Power Authority, an additional
co-owner that controls 18 percent of Unit 2, has opted not to sell its
share of the plant at this time.

The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service
Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market
value of their plants through an open, competitive process. This is part
of an overall effort to separate generation, transmission and distribution
activities within the state.

With that established, I will continue to support my case that the acquisit=
ion
of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energy's
growth strategy. In early 2000, Constellation began a restructuring of
its corporate identity, dividing its operations into two separate segments:
one focused on its merchant energy business (including Constellation Nuclea=
r)
and the other focused on regional retail energy services. The merchant
energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power
in the third quarter of 2000, and the company is committed to expanding
this growth. The goal for the merchant energy business, according to=20
Constellation
Energy CEO Christian Poindexter, is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000
MW of electric generation facilities by 2005. Toward that end, Constellatio=
n
Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage
of ""bargain prices for nuclear plants,"" which resulted in large part from
other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing,
or being mandated, to divest their generation plants.

Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group,
a unit within Constellation Nuclear, was established when Baltimore Gas
& Electric, another Constellation Energy subsidiary, created a new area
for its life-cycle license renewal activities. Thus, most likely Constellat=
ion
will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units,
and has a core group of people with expertise in this area. License renewal=
s
in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC, so there shoul=
d
not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process. The
only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe=
nt
in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC.

Presently, Constellation's generation assets are based in a mixture of
coal and nuclear. The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making
expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset, an 850-MW two-unit nuclear plant
in Southern Maryland. As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the
foreseeable future, buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and
nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases. Thus, Constellation could
be in a prime position if the desire for nuclear-generated power continues
to rise, as the company anticipates. While Constellation will most likely
retain its coal-fired generation assets, the company is clearly moving
closer toward a nuclear-based portfolio. Constellation has justified its
move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear
fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that ""the economics [of
nuclear] are quite robust, once they are calculated out.""

A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea=
ses
is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a 10-year contract to provide
electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices. Specific terms
of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of its
share of the Nine Mile Point plants' output back to the sellers at an avera=
ge
price of nearly $35/MWh until 2010. This alone should provide a solid rate
of return for Constellation's merchant energy business.

In addition, as I indicated, the New York location is key factor in this
deal. Aside from its large population, the state of New York is home to
a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently. For these
two reasons alone, New York stands out as the center within Constellation's
focus on the Northeastern United States. Yet, Constellation's competitors
also have the same plan, and have all fought to gain assets in the region.


Just within the last few months, Entergy Corp.=01*which also has based its
strategy to a large extent on nuclear=01*has been aggressively making its
own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State. In fact, Entergy
was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders
for the Nine Mile Point plants. I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor=
d,
an Entergy spokesperson, back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was
actively attempting to purchase the two plants. However, despite the loss
of the two Nine Mile Point plants, Entergy retains a very strong nuclear
presence in New York. In late November, Entergy closed the sale on the
New York Power Authority's two nuclear power plants, Indian Point Unit
3 in Westchester County and the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County=
.
In fact, the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest=20
acquisition
to date in Entergy's nuclear strategy, and also represented the highest
purchase price ($967 million) ever of a nuclear asset. Earlier in the same
month, Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point 2 plant from Con
Edison. Altogether, Entergy now controls over 3,000 MW of nuclear generatio=
n
in the state of New York.

Consequently, since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of
the top nuclear power producers in the industry, it will need to match
Entergy (along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke) with regard
to its nuclear portfolio. There is only a limited number of nuclear plants
that will become available for purchase, and thus any acquisition of an
operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in
this particular market.

As a sidenote, I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary
sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants (100 percent of Unit 1 and 41 percent
of Unit 2). It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir=
ed
by National Grid, a U.K. company that is considered one of the world's
largest independent transmission companies. The acquisition of Niagara
Mohawk is supporting National Grid's strategy of becoming a major presence
in the transmission and distribution sectors of the U.S. energy industry.
Generation is not a high priority for National Grid, and the sale of Niagar=
a
Mohawk's nuclear assets resulted from this strategy.

Moreover, once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches
that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States.
Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawk's current strategy,
it is a key component for Constellation Energy. There are certainly risks
associated with both approaches, but the bottom line on this deal, from
my perspective, is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets
in a strong market. It's pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be
a contender in the nuclear arena, especially in New York, and owning the
two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal.

marketing affiliates hold a much higher percentage of the capacity on their 
sister pipelines than they do on non-affiliated pipes.  They argue that 
unfairness or abuse can be inferred from that fact alone.  The Enron pipes 
may be a statistical oddity on this.  A very small percentage of NN and TW 
capacity has been held by affiliates.  I think the same is true on Border and 
to a lesser extent on Florida.  Amoco and Dynegy can't have it both ways.  If 
they want to infer abuse from a large percentage of a pipe's capacity being 
held by marketing affiliates (i.e., El Paso) then they also have to infer an

NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION:


In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk
will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas
rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.

If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk
last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara
Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity 
to
you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an
Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG
capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March,
2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of 
April.

I have created the Twister termination and will get Fred LaGrasta to sign it this afternoon. (we're not allowed to sign financial terminations down here)

Diane

PS - Richard is having some trouble with the Heartland deal.....he's getting approval from legal on the Termination template (it's a little different on the physical side).  FYI.

I want to set up a monthly automatic transfer from my checking account but 
have had trouble getting a PIN number from the phone number that was mailed 
to me.  I want to have $1,065 transferred into the CMA account; on the 15th 
of each month if possible.  I would like $150 transferred into 226-27211 and 
then used to purchase the mutual fund already in the account, $175 
transferred into 226-27210 and then used to purchase the mutual fund already 
in the account, and then have the remaining amount ($740) used to purchase 
the mutual fund in the CMA account (226-27209).  Please help.  Thanks.

The long awaited Darwin  Natural Selection Awards - Criminal Category have 
been released! ?These  awards are given each year to bestow upon that 
individual, who through  isolation by incarceration, has done the most to 
remove undesirable elements  from the human gene pool. 

RUNNER-UP # 9 Yankton, South Dakota: A woman  was arrested at her stepson's 
Boy Scout meeting. ?While watching a  policeman demonstrate his drug dog's 
ability, the dog found a bag of  marijuana in her purse. 

RUNNER-UP # 8 Colorado Springs: A guy walked  into a little corner store with 
a shotgun and demanded all the cash from the  cash drawer. ?After the cashier 
put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a  bottle of Scotch that he wanted 
behind the counter on the shelf. ?He  told the cashier to put it in the bag 
as 
well, but he refused and said  ""Because I don't believe you are over 21."" The 
robber said he was, but the  clerk still refused to give it to him because he 
didn't believe him.  ?At this point the robber took his drivers license out 
of 
his wallet  and gave it to the clerk. ?The clerk looked it over, and agreed 
that  the man was in fact over 21 and he put the Scotch in the bag. 
The robber  then ran from the store with his loot. ?The cashier promptly 
called the  police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got 
off 
the  license. ?They arrested the robber two hours later. 

RUNNER-UP # 7 A  woman was reporting her car as stolen, and mentioned that 
there was a car  phone in it. ?The policeman taking the report called the 
phone and told  the guy that answered that he had read the ad in the 
newspaper 
and wanted to  buy the car. ?They arranged to meet, and the thief was 
arrested.  

RUNNER-UP # 6 San Francisco: A man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of  
America, walked into the branch and wrote ""this iz a stikkup. ?Put all  your 
muny in this bag."" While standing in line, waiting to give his note to  the 
teller, he began to worry that someone had seen him write the note and  might 
call the police before he reached the teller window. 
So he left  the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. 
After waiting a  few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo 
teller. ?She  read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he was not 
the  brightest light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his  
stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and  
that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back  
to Bank of America. ?Looking somewhat defeated, the man said ""OK""  
and left. ?The Wells Fargo teller then called the police who arrested  the 
man 
a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of  America. 

RUNNER-UP # 5 From England: A motorist was unknowingly caught  in an 
automated 
speed trap that measured his speed using radar and  photographed his car. ?He 
later received in the mail a ticket for 40  Pounds and a photo of his car. 
Instead of payment, he sent the police  department a photograph of 40 pounds. 
? 
Several days later, he received  a letter from the police that contained 
another picture ...of handcuffs.  ?The motorist promptly sent the money for 
the fine. 

RUNNER-UP #  4 Drug Possession Defendant Christopher Jansen, on trial in 
March 
in  Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched without a warrant. ?The  
prosecutor said the officer didn't need a warrant because a ""bulge"" in  
Christopher's jacket could have been a gun. ?""Nonsense,"" said  Christopher, 
who happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in court.  ?He handed it 
over so the judge could see it. ?The judge  discovered a packet of cocaine in 
the pocket and laughed so hard he required  a five minute recess to compose 
himself. 

RUNNER-UP # 3 Oklahoma  City: Dennis Newton was on trial for the armed 
robbery 
of a convenience  store in district court when he fired his lawyer. 
Assistant District  Attorney Larry Jones said Newton, 47, was doing a fair 
job 
of defending  himself until the store manager testified that Newton was the 
robber.  ?Newton jumped up, accused the woman of lying and then said, ""I 
should  of blown your (expletive) head off."" The defendant paused, then 
quickly  added, ""If I'd been the one that was there."" The jury took 20 
minutes 
to  convict Newton and recommended a 30-year sentence. 

RUNNER-UP # 2  Detroit: R.C. ?Gaitlan, 21, walked up to two patrol officers 
who were  showing their squad car computer felon-location equipment to 
children in a  Detroit neighborhood. ?When he asked how the system worked, 
the 
officer  asked him for identification. ?Gaitlan gave them his driver's 
license,  they entered it into the computer, and moments later they arrested 
Gaitlan  because information on the screen showed Gaitlan was wanted for a  
two-year-old armed robbery in St. ?Louis, Missouri. 

RUNNER-UP #  1 Another from Detroit: A pair of Michigan robbers entered a 
record shop  nervously waving revolvers. ?The first one shouted, ""Nobody 
move!"" When  his partner moved, the startled first bandit shot him. 

THE WINNER A  Charlotte, NC, man having purchased a case of very rare, very 
expensive  cigars, insured them against fire among other things. ?Within a 
month,  having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made 
even  his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against 
the  insurance company. ?In his claim, the man stated the cigars were lost 
""in  
a series of small fires."" The insurance company refused to pay, citing the  
obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion.  ? 
The man sued.... ?and won. 
In delivering the ruling the  judge agreeing that the claim was frivolous, 
stated nevertheless that the  man held a policy from the company in which it 
had warranted that the cigars  were insurable and also guaranteed that it 
would insure against fire,  without defining what it considered to be 
""unacceptable fire,"" and was  obligated to pay the claim. ?Rather than endure 
a lengthy and costly  appeal process the insurance company accepted the 
ruling 
and paid the man  $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in ""the fires."" After 
the man cashed the  check, however, the company had him arrested on 24 counts 
of arson.  ?With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous 
case  
being used against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning his  
insured property and sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000 fine.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

See the email below for the ID and password.

Call me on Monday to discuss the download process, if you should have any 
questions.  You will log into www.enrononline.com and I think you will need 
to download shockwave media (the site should walk you through this process).  
Once you have typed in the ID and password, you will then have the option of 
setting up a personalized quote page.  Also, call me about where to see our 
posted daily indices each day on the website.  Enron releases the weighted 
average of all gas traded at each physical point every day.

spread was executed as a NOV-MAR position months ago. The only real changes 
were to Socal basis over time. There is no telling when this might have 
changed in error.  Will you please research the position to see when this 
position was reduced.  I am guessing that a park and loan was executed by 
Frank Ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to GD New by 
mistake.

My name is Ryan Hildebrand and I am from the Tau Chapter of Tau Kappa 
Epsilon. As the new Histor for our house, I have many plans.

Our house has had, in my opinion, a lack of relations with Alumni.  I feel 
that this is an important asset in the success of our chapter. Also, it is 
really
something to see fraters coming back together.  That is why my goal is to 
reestablish that connection.  After all TKE is for life!

Many ideas are in the works currently. I am in the process of locating lost 
Fraters, publishing an e-newsletter, starting a mentoring program, and 
thinking
about having some reunions before we watch the Beavers go for the National 
Championship.

I would like to extend an invitation for all alumni to check out our webpage:

http://www.orst.edu/groups/tke/

Let me know what you think and I look forward to communicating with you this 
year.

Yours in the Bond,

587,"Hey Guys. 

I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the 
ZP26/NP15 Buy-Resale on a Realtime basis. We are not doing a profit split 
this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to 
shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has 
Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the 
SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA's capacity is 21MW, 
but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know 
about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So 
by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA. 

The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. 
And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour. 

IN CAPS:
We sell to NCPA in ZP26.  
We buy from NCPA in NP15.

We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to 
ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL).
PG&E is NCPA's SC, so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call.



NCPA's tel#: (916) 786-3520
PG&E tel# : (415) 973-1969

If you guys have any questions  just ask me.

588,"Jim,
 As you might recall, we discussed hiring an Indiana law firm in connection 
with a coal delivery dispute involving Enron and NIPSCO, an Indiana utility. 
The case will end up tried in Indiana and is governed by Indiana law. Wayne 
Gresham, who works for the coal group and happens to have practiced in 
Indiana, suggested that we use a litigator named Dan Kelley.  Dan works at 
Wayne's former firm, Ice, Miller, Donadio & Ryan.
 Dan's conflicts check revealed that Ice, Miller represents the Simon 
Property Group in various contract negotiations involving EES.  Apparently, 
Simon is a long standing client of Ice Miller and has consented to Ice 
Miller's representation of Enron in the NIPSCO dispute as long as, in the 
event a dispute arises between Simon and Enron,  Enron will consent to the 
simultaneous adverse representation of Ice Miller or agrees to allow Ice 
Miller to withdraw from representing Enron to represent Simon.  Dan has no 
personal involvement with Simon and is unaware of any potential dispute 
between Enron and Simon.
 So far, Dan seems like a very competent lawyer who has been not only 
responsive to requests for quick turn around but also has shown a lot of 
""coal savvy"" which will be quite helpful to us. To the extent that we don't 
have any other connections in Indiana and I hope we won't be having any other 
litigation there, I don't see an immediate problem with the requested waiver. 
I ran this by Richard who was OK with it as well.  Please let me know if you 
are OK with this. I've copied Vicki Sharp on this note so that she can let us 
know if she is aware of anything between Enron and Simon that might be 
looming on the horizon.  Thanks in advance. ","Jim Wayne

601,"At your request, here's a write-up of our problems with the ISO.

Issue 1 - Concerning the intertie going North out of California into the 
Northwest (NW) at the California Oregon Border (COB), since about the 24th of 
January, the ISO has started telling market participants that the available 
transmission capacity, which is usually 2300 MW, is zero.  Last Friday, this 
caused prices to increase at the Mid-Columbia (NW trading hub) by about 
$50-75, costing the NW wholesale market an estimated $2-5 million per day.  
This transmission capacity is within the ISO's control and, because capacity 
is available, the ISO's actions seem to violate Order No. 888.  I also wonder 
what would happen if another control area decided they were going to take 
similar action.  This hurts Enron financially because we own FTRs and if 
there is no congestion, we don't get paid anything.  This is like ""economic"" 
force majeure.  The reason the ISO is listing zero ATC is that they're in a 
Stage 3 Emergency and they're not offering sufficient price/credit terms to 
get the power they need.  California obviously thinks its power needs are 
more important than the NW's. 

Issue 2 - We have transmission we are purchasing from some California munis 
using transmission facilities that are not part of the Cal ISO.  The ISO 
advised today that they are thinking about cutting exports from California.  
We are concerned that the ISO will cut our transaction even though it uses 
transmission assets and rights that are not under the ISO's control.  If our 
deal were cut, it could cost us $20,000 to $100,000 per hour (we have a 125 
MW deal and spreads now are $125 and they would likely blow out more if 
exports were cut).   We hesitate to call the ISO and ask if they are going to 
cut us because we are afraid we might suggest something that they haven't 
thought of.  

I'd be happy to answer any questions.  I'm at (503) 464-8862.",,"about

AES Completes Acquisition of IPALCO

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) announced that it has completed its=20
acquisition of IPALCO Enterprises, the Indianapolis, Ind.-based utility wit=
h=20
3,000 MW of generation and 433,000 customers in and around Indianapolis.=20
IPALCO has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of AES through an exchange =
of=20
shares in which each outstanding share of IPALCO common stock will be=20
exchanged for 0.463 shares of AES common stock. IPALCO common stock was=20
suspended from trading at the close of the market on March 27. =20

Analysis: The purchase of IPALCO, an established and respected utility in t=
he=20
Midwest, will help AES to continue to secure its foothold in this region an=
d=20
further the company's aggressive expansion efforts along the generation sid=
e=20
of its business. AES already owns CILCORP, an energy services company whose=
=20
largest subsidiary, CILCO, serves portions of Illinois and Missouri. (Note=
=20
that pursuant to an SEC order, AES will restructure and/or sell its ownersh=
ip=20
interests in CILCORP within two years in order to retain its status as an=
=20
exempt holding company under PUHCA). Thus, through the purchase of IPALCO,=
=20
AES is strengthening a presence in the Midwest that it already has=20
established. In addition, from this purchase we now know that AES, along wi=
th=20
being a global player, intends to remain dominant throughout the United=20
States as well. Further, the acquisition represents a rather bright=20
development for AES, considering that the company has recently encountered=
=20
some ongoing challenges related to its operations in California.=20

First, let's examine the value of AES' acquisition of IPALCO. Certainly, th=
e=20
3,000 MW of generation that AES gained in the deal must have been the prima=
ry=20
draw, but from comments made by Dennis Bakke, AES president and CEO, the=20
company apparently also wants to become a marketing presence in Indiana (an=
d=20
the Midwest as a whole). IPALCO gains in the deal by now being under the=20
aggressive management of AES; the subsidiaries under IPALCO such as=20
Indianapolis Power & Light will now stand a much better chance for global=
=20
development and expansion.=20

As with other generation acquisitions that AES has made, the company secure=
s=20
a decided edge over competitors that may have strong marketing presence but=
=20
fewer hard assets. With its strong generation portfolio, to which the IPALC=
O=20
purchase only adds, AES can further guarantee to potential customers a=20
reliable power supply. AES is one of the largest generation companies in th=
e=20
world, having reached this level through a series of strategic acquisitions=
.=20
The company's generating assets include interests in 134 facilities totalin=
g=20
over 48 gigawatts of capacity. By comparison, Calpine has approximately=20
36,700 MW, Dynegy has a net ownership of 12,497 MW, and Reliant has about=
=20
27,000 MW. In addition, AES' electricity distribution network has over=20
920,000 km of conductor and associated rights of way, and sells over 126,00=
0=20
GWh per year to over 17 million end-user customers. =20

AES has surpassed many of its power supply competitors by maintaining an=20
aggressive growth strategy over the past year. Recent milestones for the=20
company are too many to list here. However, highlights include acquiring a=
=20
controlling interest in Electricidad de Caracas; acquiring 100-percent=20
interest in Tractebel Power; purchasing 70-percent interest in the Mohave=
=20
Generating Station in Laughlin, Nev.; and purchasing GeoUtilities, Inc., an=
=20
Internet-based superstore for energy and telecom services. Just since the=
=20
start of 2001, AES entered into an agreement to purchase all of the energy=
=20
assets of Thermo Ecotec Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo=20
Electron Corporation of Waltham, Mass., for $195 million, and announced new=
=20
generation development projects in Texas and California. AES also has=20
continued its international expansion with an acquisition of a 140-MW=20
oil-fired co-generation facility in Italy, the acquisition of a 290-MW=20
barge-mounted natural-gas fired generating business in Nigeria, and the=20
purchase of additional ownership interest in a 1,000-MW hydro plant in=20
Argentina. =20

As I've said in the past, AES is a company to watch. Even when acquisitions=
=20
that AES is making seem rather small, they must be taken within the context=
=20
of the portfolio that AES is building. Whether it's generation, retail=20
marketing, telecom, or selling electricity over the Internet, AES has a=20
foothold in many different areas. AES is a major player that can offer the=
=20
full package to a customer, which may in the end be its strongest advantage=
.=20
The company maintains that it is engaged in three lines of businesses, whic=
h=20
are all equally important to its strategy: power generation, network delive=
ry=20
services and retail energy marketing. However, it is important to recognize=
=20
that AES continues to build a huge generation arsenal and now has the=20
capability to market its commodity products through its marketing=20
subsidiaries.=20

However, although AES has had a fairly successful year, the company has hit=
=20
some bumps and made some questionable decisions along the way, all of which=
=20
were related to the California market. AES has established several tolling=
=20
agreements with Williams Corp. for the power plants that AES owns in=20
California. Under the tolling agreements, AES essentially rents its plants =
to=20
Williams so that Williams can generate fuel to electricity, which it then c=
an=20
sell on the wholesale market. In other words, Williams had a contract to=20
market all of the power generated by AES' California plants. In hindsight,=
=20
AES may regret the questionable decision to enter into the tolling agreemen=
ts=20
with Williams in California. Although AES did well last year, with net inco=
me=20
rising 181 percent to $641 million, the company reportedly lost $11 million=
=20
on the lucrative California market. Meanwhile, Williams (NYSE: WMB) reporte=
d=20
unaudited 2000 income from continuing operations of $873.2 million, or $1.9=
5=20
per share on a diluted basis, versus $178 million, or 40 cents per share on=
 a=20
restated basis, for 1999. AES also took a hit when it had to pay air=20
pollution fines and buy power on the wholesale market to meet its obligatio=
ns=20
to Williams when it was forced to shut some plants down. =20

Further, AES (along with other companies) continues to fall under the inten=
se=20
scrutiny of FERC for pricing that the commission has deemed ""unjust and=20
unreasonable"" for power generated at AES-owned plants. FERC's investigation=
=20
centers on the unavailability of certain so-called ""must run"" generating=20
plants in the Los Angeles area that are owned by AES Southland, a subsidiar=
y=20
of AES. A ""must run"" plant is a generating facility that the California ISO=
=20
can call upon to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the=20
reliability of the California transmission network. Several weeks ago, FERC=
=20
announced that a preliminary investigation raised serious questions about t=
he=20
actions of Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and AES.  =20

On March 14, FERC gave the two companies 20 days to explain why they should=
=20
not refund $10.86 million to California utilities. Further, FERC said that=
=20
""Williams had a financial incentive to prolong any outages"" of two AES-owne=
d=20
plants last April and May. ""Williams received more revenues as a result of=
=20
the respective outages,"" the commission said. AES responded to the charges =
by=20
saying that the plants were taken off line for repairs and that it did not=
=20
share in market revenues from sales of power from the plants. According to =
a=20
report in The Washington Post, AES Pacific Group vice president Stu Ryan sa=
id=20
that as long as the plants are in operating condition, Williams decides whe=
n=20
they will run and what it will charge for their power. =20

As a result of the unavailability of the two ""must run"" AES plants, the=20
state's ISO had to obtain power from other plants, also owned by AES, where=
=20
the power was much more expensive and the companies made much larger=20
profits.  The commission said its investigation indicated that AES and=20
Williams refused to make the two ""must run"" plants available ""for reasons=
=20
that were not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance"" of=
=20
the plant. =20

Many power supply companies that were active in the California wholesale=20
market now are retreating due to the volatility and uncertainty of the=20
state's market. Although it remains unclear how AES will continue to=20
participate in the California market, it may be a smart move for the compan=
y=20
to focus on expanding operations in other regions of the United States (suc=
h=20
as the Midwest). Yet, how AES' acquisition of IPALCO will impact the=20
company's bottom line remains to be seen. Standard & Poor's (S&P) is=20
reserving its assessment of the partnership for the time being, and is=20
keeping AES on CreditWatch. AES' double-'B' corporate credit, single-'B'-pl=
us=20
rating on subordinated debt, and single-'B' rating on the company's trust=
=20
preferred securities remain intact pending further review and information=
=20
about the acquisition of IPALCO. Also, S=02?lowered its corporate credit ra=
tings=20
on IPALCO to triple-'B' from single-'A'-plus, and IPALCO's subsidiary,=20
Indianapolis Power & Light Co. (IPL), to triple-'B' from double-'A'-minus,=
=20
and revised the CreditWatch implications to positive from negative. S=02?ex=
pects=20
to address the CreditWatch status in the next two weeks. =20

On March 27, AES shares closed at about $47.75. As of mid-morning on March=
=20
28, AES shares were priced at about $50.00. Over the last few days, AES=20
shares have increased by about 5 percent and have closely tracked the Dow=

will be migrated on Monday, June 11,  and the second group will be migrated 
on Tuesday, June 12.   You will receive four e-mails from the Outlook 
migration team.  Please do not delete them.  You will need to open the four 
e-mails and follow the instructions to migrate to Outlook.

Assistants, you will be responsible for scheduling training for yourself and 
your assignments.  It is recommended everyone attend a one hour training 
class.  Training can be scheduled by contacting Maggie Cruz at extension 
3-1816.  (Assistants, please coordinate training with your backup so both of 
you are not in training at the same time.)  Outlook migration specialists 
will be on the 38th floor to answer questions Tuesday and Wednesday, June 12 
and 13.

Listed below is useful information provided to us by the Outlook Migration 
team.  

E-mail Policies

Users will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  

Further mailbox size restrictions are detailed as follows:

Issue Warning at 75 MB - users are automatically sent a warning from the 
System Administrator explaining they are near their Mailbox limit.

Prohibit Send at 100 MB - users are prevented from sending e-mail, yet they 
can still receive internal and external messages.  Users must reduce the size 
of their mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive, 
etc. before they can send e-mail again.   

Inbound/Outbound Mail Size Limits - inbound and outbound e-mail messages will 
be limited to a size of 10MB.

Deleted Item Retention - users will be able to recover deleted items from 
their mailbox as old as 8 days.  Deleted items include e-mail messages, 
folders, contacts, calendar entries, tasks, notes, journal entries and 
meeting notices.

Archiving - archiving will not be a supported feature of Outlook 2000. 

Migration Preparation

Clean Your Mailbox - due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are 
advised to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE 
migration.  If you are at the 100MB limit on the day of migration, you will 
not be able to send messages once you are in Outlook.

Limits on Items Migrated  - from the day of your migration, only 30 days of 
old mail will be migrated from your mailbox.  This includes mail in your 
inbox and other folders.  Calendar items dating back one year from the day of 
migration will be migrated (with the exception of repeating appointments).

641,"We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=

I'm not sure who in the London office currently takes care of Notes apps, but 
try David De-Coi or Gary Gleeson.  They (or whomever has taken over the

?
Here is where I am:? Remember that house  that Peter told us about???? The 
little one near Jackson Hill near Memorial  Park???? I haven't forgotten 
about it, even though it is small.? I am  now looking at it as a good 
investment, especially looking at what is going up  around there.? Anyway, if 
I were to buy it, it has central air and I  wouldn't need to buy a window 
unit for my other house because I would be leaving  in the next month.? Or, 
maybe I would, if it ended up taking longer than a  month to sell my present 
lot.? Some real estate friends are looking at the  little house today and 
will give me their very honest opinion this  afternoon.?
?
Tell me I am crazy, it is o.k.? I know it  already!!? I so desperately need 
change in my life.? But, Sarah is  falling apart about it because she thinks 
I am moving her into the  ghettos!!? Poor kid, she cries when I mention it.? 
There are 2 brand  new homes going up across the street from the little house 
and the lot with the  little house has a gorgeous big oak tree in it.? 
Sounding sicker by the  minute??
?
On the employment front, I still want to talk to  your folks, but I can't 
change jobs and then try to get financing approved for a  house.? I wanted to 
tell you at breakfast the other day but we had an  audience that I went to 
see a head hunter and she told me that I had been at my  job too long.? Knew 
that!? She also mentioned to me that she was  looking for another counselor 
in her office that she could train and that would  one day want equity in the 
company because she doesn't want to work  forever!!? She started in the 
business from the bottom and now has more  business than she can handle.? I 
have been thinking about it.? She is  also very adamant about me taking the 
Birkman tests.? Any  comments??

excited people there.

Title: Refined Products Line--North American Markets 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Refined Products 

US Margin Highlights 
* Responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels, 
US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline margins versus WTI fell by $2.26 per barrel 
to average $1.45 per barrel during November. Gasoline margins have returned 
to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at 
exceptionally high values. CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average 
$2.75 per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year, $1.16 per barrel 
lower than this year's first quarter average. 

* High sulfur No. 2 fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly, 
averaging $5.97 per barrel in November. Despite the drop of $0.37 per barrel 
from October's average, fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented 
values-$4.20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $3.46 per barrel greater 
that the previous five-year average. For the first quarter of 2001, CERA 
anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record 
high level of $4.75 per barrel in the first quarter.

* Jet/kerosene differentials versus WTI rose $0.63 per barrel from the 
October average, reaching a whopping $8.59 per barrel in November. In 
correspondence with the distillate market, jet/kerosene margins are at 
historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight 
fundamentals. CERA expects jet/kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the 
first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the 
holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of 
$5.75 per barrel.

* Margins for US Gulf Coast 1% sulfur residual fuel dropped by $2.15 per 
barrel, reaching $3.99 per barrel below WTI during November. Despite the 
recent widening of differentials, CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to 
support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter 
months. Residual fuel differentials are expected to average $2.50 per barrel 
below WTI during the first quarter of next year, at the high end of the 
historical range.

US Demand Highlights 
* Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0.5 million 
barrels per day (mbd) from the October level, reaching 8.36 mbd for the four 
weeks ending December 8. Demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last 
year largely because Y2K concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago. 
CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder 
temperatures arrive, averaging 8.08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001.

* Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3.94 
mbd for the four weeks ending December 8, over 7 percent greater than this 
time last year. This represents a slight increase of about 0.05 million 
barrels (mb) from the end-October level of 3.90 mb, but still a record high 
level for early December. With support from low home heating oil inventories, 
particularly in the Northeast, distillate demand has been very strong during 
the fall of 2000. CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter 
months, averaging 3.79 mb during the first quarter of next year. 

* Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the October level 
to reach 1.68 mbd for the four weeks ending December 8. Despite the decline, 
apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year-ago level. The 
relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel 
distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to 
help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals. CERA expects the 
demand for jet fuel to average 1.81 mb during the fourth quarter. 

* Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0.87 mbd for the four weeks 
ending December 8, a decline of about 0.09 mbd from the October average and a 
slight increase over the November level. Demand for residual fuel is 
currently 11 percent greater than last year, and surging natural gas prices 
are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout 
the winter. Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0.85 to 0.9 mbd 
range during the first quarter of 2001.

US Inventory Highlights 
* Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196.5 mb, increasing 
almost 10 mb from the end-October value. Responding to rising stock levels 
and declining apparent demand, forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to 
23.5 days for the four weeks ending December 8. Forward supply is 2.5 percent 
below last year's level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the 
past eight years-although CERA still believes coverage is currently 
sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter. However, CERA is 
looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and 
production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the 
start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year.

* Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of 
October at 29.2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. 
Despite record high apparent demand, strong refinery production levels helped 
boost primary distillate inventories slightly, to 115.3 mb for this period. 
Primary stocks are 16 percent below last year's level at this time and at 
their lowest historical level ever. Although stocks are low, CERA does not 
anticipate shortages to occur this winter. Assuming normally cold weather, 
refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting 
demand requirements-albeit at a high price. 

* Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage, to 
reach 25.7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. This 
moves jet fuel coverage above the 23.5 to 25 days' supply range that it had 
been in for the past four months. The rise of just under 1 day in forward 
supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand. Jet inventories 
and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull 
from tight distillate markets strengthen, but supplies are expected to be 
adequate for the winter.

* Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply 
from October, reaching 41.7 days of forward supply during the four weeks 
ending December 8. The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a 
drop in demand and an increase in stocks. With demand expected to strengthen 
because of colder weather and high gas prices, CERA looks for inventories and 
coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks.

some time to the Enron Analyst/Associate program?

would be the best date for me.

will be held either in the 2nd or the 3rd week of November. I shall know in a

You can now view GPCM pipeline schematics on the web by going to the GPCM
website, clicking ""GPCM Pipelines"" and then clicking the code for the
pipeline you want.  You can also go to that pipeline's website by clicking
it's URL.  Finally, by ""right-clicking"" the code you can copy the pipeline
schematic (a Powerpoint file) down to your local computer and use it there.
 Once you copy it down, if you put it into your gpcm8\maps sub-folder, you
can view it directly from your user interface in the Data / Pipelines form
(click the Has Map box On).  If you are a GPCM licensee and would like a
zip file of the current set of maps, you can pick it up from the Customer

  Natural Gas Markets in Mexico

  Natural gas demand in Mexico in the coming years could grow by up to 8%
annually. Such demand could lead to natural gas imports approaching 2 Bcf
per day, according to government forecasts. In response, Pemex proposes two
actions: The first consists of measures to increase cross-border pipeline
infrastructure and capacity such as a new pipeline being built by Coral
Energy into Pemex's supply hub at Reynosa. The possibility of a new
pipeline to Monterrey is still an option. A second measure is to implement
a gas-centric exploration and production program focused on five areas, two
of which are dry natural gas basins, Burgos and Macuspana. This second
measure is intended to reduce projected imports by up to 80%. At present,
Pemex's 10-year strategic plan does not contemplate a role for private
production companies in capacities other than that of technical assistance.

flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well 
as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in 
ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your 
respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in 
the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your 
respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an 
informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:

Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other 
departments
Recent successes and current projects
Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's 
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have 
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them 
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current 
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted 
Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a

Can Research in Houston put together a comparison of the long-term volatility 
curves for gas and power in North America and Europe?  Based on where Europe 
is marked (especially for the UK), I think we'll find a significant 
difference out beyond 10 years.  Fundamentally, it seems like the long-term 
vol should be similar for a given commodity regardless of geographic location.

Has Research done any work on this in the past?  If not, we should study this 
since long-term vol feeds into the VAR-based position limits.

Give me a call so we can discuss.

Thank you so much for forwarding this information to me as well as making

entire team together prior to the Career Fair on the 8th so that we can go 
over the strategy, dates on campus, and roles/responsibilities.  

Also, I know that you mentioned that the first couple of weeks in October 
would be the best to target for the General Information Session.  How does 
the week of October 9th look for you?  Is there a certain day that works the 
best?  I would like to work with your schedule to see if we can come up with

I hope your trip to Australia was successful. It's one of my favorite places
to go.

I've copied you on the email to Mike initiating Enron's trial service to
Energycast. Thanks for helping to set this up.

Would you ask the authorities in Enron to refresh my access to Enrononline?
My Guest User ID as ENA61296 and my guest password was TR84BY13. They no
longer work, probably because I haven't visited the site in months as we
were in full development mode on Energycast.

Vince, you will note in our website references to forward prices of power in
Nepool, NYPP, and PJM. We use Reuters as a reference -- not satisfactory. If
your traders like Energycast and Enron became a client, would Enron consider
linking its prices to our site? We have to improve over the Reuters quotes
and regard Enrononline or Bloomberg as the best candidates. Over time, as
our service spreads I believe this could help generate deal flow for your
traders.

Let me know what you think.

Jacob has good background in OR and can start working on
pipeline problems right away, if we need someone. 

Maybe it is from his consulting background, I found that at times
he exaggerates a bit about his roles in model building. He would 
start saying he did everything, and later water it down quite a bit.
(What he actually did is not an easy accomplishment though.) 
He also stressed that he wants to move away from pipeline

Sorry you won't be attending our April 20 ET event, but of course we realize that many of our partners can't attend every event. 
With this in mind, we put conference reports online in a ""quick read"" format for busy executives.  Our site is located at:  http://emertech.wharton.upenn.edu - we'll be adding new reports in the coming 2 weeks.
I would also ask, is there anyone else at Enron involved in mergers and acquisitions who would benefit from the April 20 event?  This will be one of our most ""content-rich"" events - reporting on surveys on high tech acquisitions as well as best practices in successful mergers and partnerships. Please feel free to pass on the invitation to colleagues at Enron who you feel might find this worthwhile, or you can give me email addresses if you'd like me to extend the invitation with the most recent agenda.
We very much appreciate Enron's support of the ET Program and look forward to your participation in the future.

Today's focus: Gadgets a go-go

By Dave Kearns

We've talked about helpful tools and utilities lately, and a
number of readers drew my attention to The Gadget Factory. Now,
maybe I'm the last person in the world to have heard of it -
but if it is new to you too, then you need to check it out as
soon as you can.

The Gadget Factory (http://www.gadgetfactory.com) is an
Australian operation that produces shareware network utilities
for both NetWare- and Windows-based networks. All of the
Factory's products are available as evaluation copies, which
can be turned into full versions by registration (and paying a
small fee, typically US$20 or $25 for a single-user version).

As I mentioned in last week's ""Useful utilities"" newsletter,
I really like tools that do one thing and do it well. Gadget
Factory has a number of tools that fit that description. I
really like tools that do one thing and do it well (see:
http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/netware/2001/01047621.html).


One good example is DSpace. DSpace lets network managers find
disk space usage problems quickly and easily. In a NetWare 3.x
environment, DSpace will list all the users in the Bindery,
along with how much space they are using, while in an Novell
Directory Services tree you can select any part of the tree and
DSpace will report all the users from that point down. DSpace
can be used on NetWare 5.x NSS volumes, as well as traditional
volumes.

The Factory's latest utility is NWEXPLORE, a Windows Explorer
style program designed to provide specific NetWare information
quickly and easily. It can display the total size of
directories without having to count each file and subdirectory.
Trustee assignments can be quickly and easily viewed, granted
and adjusted. Directory quotas also can be viewed and modified.

There are a half dozen other utilities that are useful to at
least some of you - such as WhoHasIt, which quickly shows you
which users have a particular file open. Check out the entire
collection. Download the evaluations and try them on your
network - I'll bet there's at least one you'll want to buy.

News flash: In a Novell NetWare newsletter that was sent
earlier this month and headlined ""Is NetWare safe from would-
be hackers?"" we discussed how NetWare could be open to
attacks. In this week's issue of Network World, senior editor
Deni Connor, delves deeper into this subject and details the
best practices for securing your network. You can read her
article at

We shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from Sandeep with the 
numbers you have 
requested.  What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on 
the power situation in India
published by The Financial Times. 

The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting 
millions of people.
One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due 
to  power
shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost 
of power produced
by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230 
million people.

The second article is Enron specific.

                     ASIA-PACIFIC: Power failure hits north India 
                     Financial Times; Jan 3, 2001
                     By ANGUS DONALD

                     Tens of millions of people were left without electricity 
in northern India
                     yesterday after a power grid breakdown. 

                     Electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and 
most parts of the
                     capital New Delhi, with 60 to 70 per cent of supply 
expected to be restored
                     by the end of the day, according to power grid 
officials. 

                     The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(Assocham), a
                     leading business organisation, expressed ""deep concern"" 
and called for a
                     mechanism to prevent future disruption that could 
""cripple the economy"". 

                     The power failure across eight Indian states, including 
New Delhi, disrupted
                     train services, water supplies and the telephone network 
and forced
                     hospitals to switch to emergency generators. 

                     The fault occurred on the Northern Grid, which provides 
electricity for 226m
                     people, and affected the states of Delhi, Haryana, 
Punjab, Uttar Pradesh,
                     Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu 
and Kashmir. 

                     A breakdown at a sub-station in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, 
India's most
                     populous state, caused an overload of power on other 
lines, which then
                     failed as well. 

                     Trains stopped running for most of the day and signals 
systems were
                     damaged. New Delhi international airport was also 
slightly affected before
                     its own power supply could be engaged. 

                     ""We will probe into the reasons for the failure. It is 
most likely to be a
                     technical failure, but we will investigate why it 
happened,"" Suresh Prabhu,
                     the power minister, was quoted as saying by Press Trust 
of India. 

                     India suffers regularly from power problems because of 
lack of funding to
                     upgrade infrastructure. Theft of supplies is also a big 
problem. Thirty per
                     cent of the country's electricity is stolen, according 
to analysts. In New
                     Delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen. 

                     Two years ago, a power failure blacked out Uttar Pradesh 
and Delhi for
                     hours. 

                     Assocham issued a statement, saying that increasing 
industrial demand
                     would exacerbate the problems already faced by India's 
inefficient power
                     sector. ""The slow progress, particularly in 
strengthening the transmission
                     and distribution system, and ever increasing theft will 
contribute to
                     worsening the power supply situation further.""

pays the Texas-based
                     company, whose Dollars 2.2bn electricity generating 
plant at Dabhol is
                     India's biggest single foreign investment. 

                     Maharashtra's tariff has more than doubled since 1993 
and is three times
                     greater than that charged by other independent power 
producers (IPPs).
                     The tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the 
rupee against the
                     dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha 
fuel. The state also pays
                     a fixed capacity charge of Rs970m (Dollars 21m) a month, 
reflecting the
                     huge project cost and, controversially, irrespective of 
consumption. 

                     A showdown looks inevitable, reminiscent of a clash six 
years ago that
                     damaged India's appeal to foreign investors. A former 
official of the World
                     Bank, which has criticised the deal, says Enron is 
emerging ""as the East
                     India Company of the 21st century"" - a reference to the 
British trader that
                     colonised key areas of the Indian economy in the 19th 
century. 

                     The stand-off is the latest blot on India's power 
sector. The UK's PowerGen
                     and Cogentrix of the US have quit India recently, 
frustrated by long approval
                     procedures, inadequate payments mechanisms or because of 
higher
                     returns elsewhere. 

                     ""India has lost time and opportunity and has driven 
returns down by six
                     percentage points,"" says Gerry Grove-White, former India 
general manager
                     of PowerGen, which has sold its 655MW plant in Gujarat 
to China Light &
                     Power of Hong Kong. 

                     India's national plan for the five years to 2002 says 
generating capacity
                     must rise by 40,000MW to about 120,000MW. But since 
1992, IPPs have
                     added only 3,000MW and 2,500MW remains under 
construction. This is
                     insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8 
per cent economic
                     growth. 

                     Enron was a bellwether of India's liberalisation, 
winning fast-track project
                     approval in the early 1990s. Phase 1, a 740MW plant 
fuelled by expensive
                     naphtha came on stream in May 1999, and phase 2, a 
Dollars 1.87bn plant
                     of 1,624MW capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied 
natural gas (LNG),
                     will be completed this year. Only two of seven other 
fast-track proposals
                     have achieved financial closure. 

                     From the outset Enron encountered attacks, culminating 
in Maharashtra's
                     then nationalist government cancelling the project 
before renegotiating
                     terms no less onerous. Vilasrao Deshmukh, chief minister 
of the successor
                     government, says the power purchase agreement is 
unaffordable. 

                     Enron, whose attackers also include cultural 
chauvinists, wants to maintain
                     good political relations in a hostile but lucrative 
environment. Enron views
                     India as a testing ground for its evolution from a 
traditional manager of
                     power plants to a broad-based trader of commodities, 
such as energy, gas
                     and bandwidth. 

                     To support these ambitions Enron hopes to trade energy 
between power
                     surplus and deficit states, once legislation is passed 
this year. It is building
                     an LNG terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural 
gas. And it is
                     laying a 15,000km fibre-optic network to trade bandwidth 
space in a country
                     desperately short of this new economy commodity. 

                     In any event, Enron believes it has a watertight 
contract. It is supported by
                     many that believe any subversion of the contract would 
confirm investor
                     perception of Maharashtra, India's financial and 
industrial hub, as an
                     unreliable destination for investment. 

                     Mr Deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his 
predecessor, which
                     threatened to ""dump Dabhol into the Arabian Sea"" - is 
under pressure from
                     radical members of his wobbly coalition. But his options 
are limited.
                     Scrapping the project would be ruinous for an 
economically troubled state
                     that would have to compensate shareholders. 

                     Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the local utility 
and Enron's main
                     client, is obliged to dispatch or ""off-take"" 90 per cent 
of Dabhol's output. Yet
                     MSEB has never honoured these guarantees. Its off-take 
has averaged 60
                     per cent since the plant opened and, in effect, MSEB has 
been paying a lot
                     more while consuming a lot less power. 

                     One reason off-take is low is because the state's tough 
new regulator has
                     told MSEB to buy from cheaper sources. Enron says the 
tariff would be
                     Rs4.02/kWh if MSEB's off-take averaged 90 per cent. But 
with off-take a
                     third lower, the average tariff is Rs4.94 per unit, and 
often higher. In
                     October, the tariff was Rs6.91 per unit, when off-take 
was about 49 per
                     cent. Enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2, 
run on cheaper
                     LNG, starts. 

                     These cost pressures have forced MSEB to take up only 
half of a 30 per
                     cent equity option in phase 2. Enron has acquired the 
balance and
                     mandated bankers to find a buyer. 

                     Enron's difficulties have undermined the appeal of IPPs, 
which have failed to
                     deliver the flood of investments. Potential IPPs feared 
they would never be
                     paid by state generating boards that have become a 
byword for corrupt
                     management of power. 

                     Reform of state electricity boards, whose uneconomic 
pricing means
                     industrial users subsidise poor farmers, as well as 
transmission and
                     distribution (T&D) services to check huge theft and 
technical losses, is
                     overdue. ""Given the limited resources, money would be 
better spent on T&D
                     rather than on new plant,"" says Oliver Blackaby, 
managing director of N M
                     Rothschild in India, which is advising Karnataka on the 
privatisation of its
                     distribution network. 

                     For the moment, attention is fixed on Enron's ability to 
satisfy the
                     competing interests of investors and clients. As Sanjay 
Bhatnagar, chief
                     executive officer of Enron India, said in a recent trade 
magazine, one of the
                     key lessons learned from phase 2 is ""having flexibility 
to deal with
                     externalities"".

The following is an update on LJM deal:

1) I participated on a conference call with AA (Jitendra and others) and our 
Accounting/Credit Group (Wes, Bill Bradford and others) yesturday, in which 
we discussed the best approach for definining credit reserves at year-end for 
the puts we own. 
2) A big chunck of the meeting was dedicated to explain AA the details of the 
deal. Little progress was made on achieving the meeting's goal.
3) Apparently, Accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts 
value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed. That 
line of action was implied on a pre-meeting we had early that morning. From 
my understanding, Accounting argues that we should not make any credit 
reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year-end.     
4) At a certain point Jintendra suggested me to use a two factor 
MC-simulation for calculating the position with credit risk. The approach is 
actually a more simplified version of the model we have. I and nobody 
mentioned the results we got from our 2-factor model.
5) At that same afternoon I knew from Accounting that we are in a process of 
unwinding our position. 

These are the main points. Please let me know if need more details.

I write you at this time to advise you I had occasion to discuss two
current Enron/UT issues with Rick:
I.  Spring 2001 Conference Participation by Jeffrey K. Skilling
II.  UT Participation in EnronTraining Activities
Per my conversation with Rick last Thur., I followed up on that discussion
with an e-mail this morn that touched on those two topics.

I.  With respect to the first, I wrote Rick this morning that:

1.  We at the UT Center for Energy Finance Education and Research (CEFER)
are planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2001 (late Feb.
or early March) to discuss four topics:  Risk management, Deregulation,
Real options, and International/globalization.
2.  The Conference will kick off with a dinner/keynote address Thur.
evening, then continue all day Fri.
3.  I have had several discussions with you regarding Conference timing,
structure, participation and content.
4.  Further to Rick's agreement to do so during our discussion last Thur.,
in today's e-mail I asked Rick to extend an invitation to Jeff Skilling to
be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.

II.  With respect to the second topic, Rick and I also discussed UT
partcipation in Enron Corp. internal training for incoming Enron Corp.
analysts and associates.  Consequently, I e-mailed Rick this morning a
specific set of issues -- ""Valuation and Risk Management in Energy Markets""
-- which my UT colleagues and I have covered in public as well as
customized exec ed settings, and which we would be pleased to customize for
presentation at Enron.  FYI, I am enclosing a copy of said topics at the
end of this e-mail.

I look forward to seeing you again soon, and to your UT visit on 10/11.  Best,
Ehud

I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.  The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.  Please let me know.

Abstract
Bankruptcy probabilities of private companies are estimated via Bayesian approach. The proportional hazard models are used with time to bankruptcy as a dependent variable. Several financial ratios are included as independent variables. MCMC algorithm is used to obtain the posterior distribution. Finally, bankruptcy probabilities of companies are predicted using the predictive probabilities.

probably Frank is ready to listen to the isea of increasing the number of factors and capturing term-structure of correlations
by using historical log-returns as factor loadings.

Should we push for it?

809,"Thank you, Joe. If they include combinatorial bids then it would be a much more complicated system. I think everything comes down to liquidity. If they have enough volume, then it will attract even more bidders because the bidders do not have to think too much about the ""fair"" price because they will always get the lowest successful price anyway. If there is small volume, then it will become harder for the bidders to decide on optimal bidding strategy. Personally I think this system will work because there are many speculators out there who want to play this kind of games.

811,"Vince, I want you to be aware of the discussions between RAC, IT and Research regarding using more than 7 factors for VAR.

I presented this idea couple of months ago. This will resolve the issue of capturing term-structure of correlations across different commodities which we have for our current VAR system and which we try to overcome by some patches (joint factors for selected groups of commodities). This will not increase the amount of calculations. In fact, just the opposite, this will
decrease the number of independent random variables which drive the model from approximately 1000 to about 60-40.

RAC did not pay much attention at that time. IT was busy with other things. This task was low priority.

Recently Naveen realized that his Convolution VAR will not work unless this idea of increasing the number of factors 
is implemented. With the present system he needs to deal with 1000 independent random variables and this is not feasible
for Convolution (or Analytical) VAR. 

We had a meeting regarding this issue last week and the consensus was finally to go ahead and increase the number of factors.
This is good news because we need this change in our system for the new ""Reliability VAR"" as well.

What worries me that Naveen presents this change now as part of the Convolution VAR. Not only it sounds now like his
idea, but, more importantly, I am afraid that when we need the same change (60 factors) for Reliability VAR we will
have to seek IT support again and compete with RAC for resources and we always loose in this battle. In addition, the 
Monte-Carlo is not going away so the right thing to do is to implement 60 factors in our production system.

Tanya

The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
than RISK MAgazine.

If the article is published it will give you more exposure in 
the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
accomplishment.

On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
among the practitioners.

I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

For your benefit I have compiled a shortlist of the main projects worked on 
over the past five months:

1) Inflation curve modelling (February and March)
2) UK Power Monthly Vol Curve generator
3) Nordic Power Monthly Vol Curve generator
4) Energydesk.com models & support
5) Compound options for UK Power desk (options to build power stations)
6) Continental power non-generic options (using arbitrary trader-specified 
distributions)
7) Global products: non-generic options modelling and new commodity forward 
curve construction (benzene fwd curve from naphtha)
8) Exotic options library upgrade/model test/bug fixes (e.g. testing new/old 
Asian models)
9) Continental gas volatility curve construction

London and Oslo staff recently.

818,"Dear all,

Attached is Anjam's reasoning and final version of the UK PPI PLLU model. 

The UK Inflation Book's main exposure is to two PPI indexes - the PLLU and 
the DZCV through year 2010. Both are PPI Output indexes with very comparable 
baskets. The only significant difference between the two is the presence of 
energy in the PLLU (7.6%). The model in use escalates the two indexes by the 
same factors. However, with the energy price fluctuations in recent years 
different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their 
drivers. Anjam concentrated on the PLLU index first and he will shortly 
construct one for the DZCV based on the same methodology, but without the 
Brent Crude curve. 

The new model achieves the two main objectives of the PPI curve: it is 
significantly more robust and stable than the existing one, and it is 
considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients. This will result in us 
having more confidence in our monthly P&L as well as less fluctuations.

Asset Sale Between TXU and EDF Supports European Strategies of Both Compani=
es



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[News item from PR Newswire] TXU Corp. (NYSE: TXU) has agreed to sell its 2=
,000 MW coal-fired West Burton power station, near Retford, Nottinghamshire=
, England, to London Electricity Group for GBP366 million (U.S. $523 millio=
n). In another transaction, TXU also announced the sale of Eastern Electric=
ity, its U.K. distribution business, and its 50-percent interest in 24seven=
, the company that operates and maintains the distribution network, to Lond=
on Electricity for GBP 1.31 billion (U.S. $1.873 billion). London Electrici=
ty, a distribution company that serves three million customers across Brita=
in, is a subsidiary of Electricite de France (EDF), the state-owned and lar=
gest energy firm in France. London Electricity already owns the other 50 pe=
rcent of 24seven.=20

Analysis: It's rather rare that an asset sale equally benefits the two ener=
gy companies involved in the transaction, but that appears to be the case i=
n this deal between TXU and EDF. Both companies are pursuing different stra=
tegies, but they share a common goal of gaining a leading position in their=
 respective niches in the European market. The transfer of both TXU's gener=
ating station and the entire distribution business in the United Kingdom to=
 the French conglomerate EDF should help both companies increase market sha=
re in their respective markets. The divestiture enables TXU to obtain its g=
oal of accumulating a total of about $2 billion in available capital to gro=
w its energy merchant business across Continental Europe. For EDF, which ai=
ms to gain 20 percent of the market in Britain, the sale solidifies the com=
pany's position as a leader in the distribution sector and also expands its=
 generation assets (both through its London Electricity subsidiary). Althou=
gh the deal appears to be a winning transaction for both companies, one stu=
mbling block toward obtaining necessary regulatory approval is the lingerin=
g frustration over EDF's expansion in other countries while the French mark=
et remains comparatively restricted.=20

Before moving on to the individual strategies of TXU and EDF, let's establi=
sh what is included in the current transactions. As noted, the sale of the =
generation assets includes only the coal-fired West Burton plant, for which=
 London Electricity has also agreed to complete the installation of a flue =
gas desulphurization process. The transaction also includes a long-term con=
tract for TXU to supply the station with coal. TXU Europe's distribution bu=
siness is actually the largest in the United Kingdom, and includes the asse=
ts and wires that deliver electricity through a 56,000-mile network in East=
 Anglia and southeast England. Both transactions must obtain regulatory app=
roval from the European Union, and U.S. regulators may review the sales as =
well.=20

Let's now look at the separate gains that the two companies make in these t=
ransactions.=20

TXU Corp.
First, it is important to note that the European expansion of Dallas-based =
TXU Corp. is driven by the company's TXU Europe subsidiary. TXU's divestitu=
re of its U.K. power assets is part of a larger strategy that the company h=
as been pursuing for over a year. In a nutshell, TXU Corp. has sought to ga=
in $2 billion from selling off non-strategic assets owned by TXU Europe to =
support further growth of the company's core trading and merchant energy bu=
sinesses across the Continent. In February 2001, TXU Europe announced the s=
ale of its gas-field assets in the North Sea to Consort Resources, which wa=
s the first indication that the company was moving away from a hard-asset s=
trategy. TXU believes it only needs to have access to power supply through =
various contracts to retain its position as a leading power trader in Europ=
e. Toward this end, TXU Europe also recently announced the sale of its 20-p=
ercent stake in Spain's Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico. In June, TXU complet=
ed the divestiture of its 1,000-MW Rugeley coal-fired power station to Inte=
rnational Power. In August, TXU sold two gas-fired power plants in Eastern =
England, totaling 705 MW, to Centrica, a British gas and home services supp=
lier, for $250 million.=20

Under the current sale of its U.K. assets, TXU exits the regulated pipes an=
d wires business in the United Kingdom and gains available capital to suppo=
rt further growth in its trading business across the Continent. Specificall=
y, from both sales TXU reportedly will reach its total of $2 billion in ava=
ilable financial resources and substantially exceed its previously establis=
hed GBP 1 billion debt-reduction target. In other words, proceeds from the =
sales reportedly will allow TXU to strengthen its financial position by red=
ucing debt, and TXU says it expects to cut its net debt-to-capital ratio to=
 55 percent by early 2002. However, the sale of the distribution assets inc=
ludes a one-time write-off of $150 million that TXU is taking associated wi=
th transaction and debt restructuring. The write-off has caused TXU to redu=
ce its 2002 earnings by 39 cents a share. The company now expects to earn b=
etween $4.35 to $4.45 a share next year.=20

With the divestiture proceeds in hand, TXU Europe's primary business model =
will remain focused on energy trading, a market in which the company holds =
a top-three position throughout the Continent. Further, the asset sales ext=
ricates TXU from the distribution sector, which it acknowledges is a busine=
ss that provides lower returns and declining profitability. The bottom line=
 for TXU in this and related sales is to ""recycle capital into the faster g=
rowing merchant energy business,"" in the words of TXU Europe's CEO, enablin=
g the company to derive more than three-fourths of its subsequent proceeds =
from this business. It is important to note that TXU Europe includes genera=
ting, trading and retail operations under the larger umbrella of its energy=
 merchant operations. TXU Europe will probably remain involved in Britain's=
 retail market, where the company retains the power-supply contract to serv=
e 5.5 million customers, but the company is no longer interested in the dis=
tribution sector of this market.=20

Moreover, it is clear that energy trading is now the core of TXU's European=
 operations. TXU Europe holds a trading volume of approximately 600 GWh, an=
d earlier in 2001 the parent company TXU Corp. reported a 75-percent jump i=
n its revenue that was attributed in large part to its energy trading busin=
ess, both in Europe and the United States. TXU Europe still hopes to contro=
l physical assets in Europe, as represented by its purchase this year of a =
51-percent state in Germany's Kiel utility, which in terms of volumes and c=
ustomer base is the ninth largest of hundreds of municipalities in Germany.=
 However, it is clear that TXU is moving out of the U.K. power distribution=
 market and its sights are more clearly focused on Continental Europe.=20

Upon the word that the sales would drag down its earnings growth for the ne=
xt three years, TXU shares fell about 8.5 percent on Nov. 19 to close at $4=
5.59. In early morning trading on Nov. 20, TXU shares were priced at $45.15=
. However, Wall Street analysts indicate that the sales should increase TXU=
's long-term attractions because it will presumably be pursuing other acqui=
sitions enabled by these sales.=20

Electricite de France
As noted, London Electricity is buying the generation and distribution asse=
ts from TXU, but it must be understood that these moves are being driven by=
 the French-government owned Electricite de France, London's Electricity's =
parent company. EDF, which still maintains a practical monopoly status in F=
rance, purchased London Electricity in 1998 for 1.9 million British pounds =
($2.72 billion) from Entergy Corp. Based on comments from EDF over the last=
 year, the company plans on expanding its products and services and investi=
ng in further strategic alliances to become a multi-energy company.=20

In fact, London Electricity acknowledges that the purchases are part of the=
 company's strategy to consolidate its position within the United Kingdom. =
Thus, while the U.K. market no longer appears to be a core focus of TXU, it=
 obviously holds appeal for other companies that are attempting to gain a m=
arket share in Europe. Upon completion of the transactions, EDF / London El=
ectricity will increase its share of the U.K. generation market to 7.5 perc=
ent from 4.5 percent, and reduce the gap that currently exists between its =
market share of generation versus distribution in the United Kingdom. Londo=
n Electricity already owns the Cottam power station, a 2,000-MW coal-fired =
generating plant located near the West Burton plant. However, London Electr=
icity will still own far less generation capacity in the United Kingdom whe=
n compared to the market leaders Powergen (which controls 10,000 MW) and In=
nogy (which controls about 8,000 MW).=20

Thus, the true focus of these purchases by London Electricity may be on the=
 distribution sector. Upon completion of the transactions, London Electrici=
ty will own Britain's largest power distribution network and control about =
18 percent of the country's distribution business. Analysts have suggested =
that EDF overpaid for TXU's West Burton plant (the buying price represented=
 a 26-percent premium over the plant's book value), but got a fair price fo=
r the distribution assets. The point here may be that EDF was arguably will=
ing to pay more for the generation assets as it already holds a solid lock =
on distribution in the United Kingdom and is attempting to expand further b=
y gaining control over generation assets. Representatives from London Elect=
ricity have said that the company and its parent want to be one of the top =
five players in the United Kingdom, and have a goal of gaining 20 percent o=
f market share in the region. London Electricity has been named as a conten=
der for the U.K. supply company Seaboard, which current owner AEP plans to =
put for sale next year. Seaboard serves around two million customers in Eng=
land (in the towns of Kent, Sussex and Surrey).=20

The involvement in EDF in this U.K. expansion has added a renewed spark to =
an old debate, namely the growth of EDF into other European countries while=
 competition in France remains comparatively restricted. In other words, ED=
F has been the target of intense criticism across Europe for the last sever=
al years as the governments of other countries and other power firms have a=
rgued that EDF has taken advantage of investments abroad while fiercely pro=
tecting its own turf. For instance, while Germany has opened 100 percent of=
 its power market to competition, France has opted for a phased-in approach=
, opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February 2003 and Au=
gust 2008, respectively. While France remains rather blocked, EDF has freel=
y admitted that it plans to acquire other companies in England, Spain, Ital=
y, and possibly the United States. This dichotomy may become a factor as th=
e current transactions with TXU fall under review of the European Union.=20

In light of all of the recent extraordinary business matters that have been facing us we have held of launching the traditional year end PRC process.
Many of you will recall in our response to the lay it on the line survey we had announced several changes to this process primarily deigned to clarify the purpose of the PRC meetings and streamline the process.
However, given all that has happened in the last 3 weeks and all the critical business matters including the strategic review of our core and non-core businesses, we have concluded that it would be wise not to dictate we follow the previously announced guidelines.
Specifically, we will delegate to each of the business unit leads to decide whether they want to use the 360 PEP electronic feedback process and what form they would like to undertake any relative talent discussions.
Please look for further details and direction on the above from your BU lead in the next few days.
While we hope you understand that we need to make sure that we channel our efforts appropriately at this difficult time, we would want to make sure that everyone understands that:
	1. We will have a bonus process. This will be conducted largely as in the past, but with a particular emphasis on those employees		 		critical to business operations and ensuring our ability to successfully complete our proposed merger with Dynegy.
	2. If there is a rationalisation of headcount following our strategic business review of core and non-core, this will be conducted			 appropriately. Our PRC process will not be the sole determinant in any such process, many other factors will be considered and as such			 this will be a separate process. 


Need help with last 2 bullets! Question is whether to send now or wait for another 3 weeks.


What d'ya think?

IN THE MONEY: Enron - From Energy Trader To Spinmeister
By Carol S. Remond

11/23/2001
Dow Jones News Service=20

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

(This column was originally published Wednesday.)=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With the value of its stock continuing to plummet, E=
nron Corp. (ENE) tried to put on a good face Wednesday by issuing a press r=
elease touting, among other things, increased liquidity.
The problem is that most of the so-called news was three days old, recycled=
 from the company's latest quarterly filing.=20
And investors weren't fooled by the release. Although the stock of the emba=
ttled Houston energy trader regained some ground immediately after the rele=
ase, climbing to $5.35 a share from $4.60, it quickly gave up most of its g=
ains. One hour after the release, Enron stock was back trading at $4.98 a s=
hare, down more than 28% on the day.=20
""They had to say something, but really didn't have any new news. It's quite=
 incredible,"" said a Wall Street analyst covering Enron.=20
Amid mounting fears that Enron's credit woes could thwart its plan to merge=
 with rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN), a merger that many see as the only way for E=
nron to avoid possible bankruptcy, Enron began its press release by announc=
ing that ""it has closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously annou=
nced $1 billion in secured credit lines...""=20
Great news, given the way Enron has been burning through cash. Except that =
investors who took time to read Enron's filing with the Securities and Exch=
ange Commission on Monday already knew that ""on November 19, 2001, Enron cl=
osed a $450 million new secured line of credit, which will mature in the fo=
urth quarter of 2002."" Readers of the company's 10-Q also knew that the $45=
0 million credit was secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas =
Co.=20
Meanwhile, the real news everyone was waiting for, an announcement about wh=
ether a $690 million loan due next Tuesday had been extended, has yet to be=
 finalized.=20
Enron said in its release that it expected that an extension to mid-Decembe=
r would be formalized soon.=20
Separately, people familiar with the matter said J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. an=
d Citigroup Inc. continue to work with Enron to extend the maturity of the =
syndicated loan, which contains a clause that, unbeknownst to many, was tri=
ggered by Enron's ratings downgrade to ""BBB-"" by Standard & Poor's Corp. ea=
rlier this month. The clause stipulated that Enron would have to repay the =
$690 million note on November 27 if it didn't post collateral.=20
Those people said that the syndicated loan, which is built inside a structu=
red vehicle used to finance minority interests in power and energy sectors =
around the world, would likely be extended to the middle of 2002 when other=
 bank loans to Enron come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion =
in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be re=
structured.=20
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the =
process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the o=
utstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, according=
 to the people familiar with the terms.=20
Meanwhile, Dynegy also tried to rally, although somewhat halfheartedly, inv=
estors around its plan to acquire Enron's stock. Dynegy said it was encoura=
ged by reports that Enron closed on its remaining $450 million credit facil=
ity and news of the extension of the $690 million loan. Under the terms of =
the acquisition, Enron holders would receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each E=
nron share.=20
Investors, however, remain more circumspect, unmoved by the whopping 104% r=
isk premium currently attached to the merger. (That's how much investors bu=
ying Enron shares would make if the deal was closing Wednesday.)=20
Aside from continued worries about how much bad news may still come, analys=
ts and traders appear particularly concerned with Enron's liquidity, or lac=
k thereof, going forward.=20
""We're having a hard time believing that this new credit infusion (from the=
 banks), even with the $1.5 billion from Dynegy, will provide enough liquid=
ity for Enron,"" one risk arbitrageur at a New York hedge fund said.=20
As part of the merger agreement between Dynegy and Enron, Chevron Texaco, w=
hich owns 26% of Dynegy, already injected $1.5 billion into Enron. Another =
$1 billion is expected upon closing of the deal.=20

846,"One of Steve Kean's newly formed Working Groups is for ""Rates & Tariffs"".  I 
have been asked to lead this group.  For those of you who don't know me, I am 
in Houston in the U.S./Canada Government Affairs group, in a section called 
""Rates/Regulatory Services.""  Our working group will have about a dozen or so 
people from various parts of Public Affairs.  You have been 
selected/volunteered to participate in this effort by your group leaders.  

The Working Group members are:
Ray Alvarez
Sergio Assad
Roy Boston
Mike Grimes
Kyran Hanks
Rita Hartfield
Nancy Hetrick
Tom Hoatson
Paul Kaufman
Valeria Lima
Bob Neustaedter

Having this group will give us a great opportunity to identify needs related 
to rate and tariff issues across many business lines and countries, share 
resources, problems and solutions, and generally improve the cohesiveness of 
Steve's organization   One of our first tasks will be to think through and 
concretely specify what we expect to accomplish as a group.   We do not have 
a specific product mandate per se - it will be up to us to figure it out and 
deliver it.   Some possibilities are - identifying rates and tariffs policy 
positions, developing policies where none now exist, but are needed, 
identifying rates and tariff resources available to the group, and acquiring 
resources needed by the group. 

As a preliminary matter, could you e-mail me your group name, position, 
location, phone, e-mail address, and ""area of expertise"".  We will assemble 
this information in a roster to be distributed to the group.

Early in January, we will be in touch to check availability and schedule an 
initial meeting.  Please be as flexible as possible.  In some cases, we are 
many time zones apart and it will be difficult to match everyone's desired 
time. 

As a second preliminary matter, please give some thought to and e-mail me 
what you think a group like this should accomplish.  Remember, the roster 
above has some of the world's leading authorities on rates and tariffs!   We 
will compile both the complete roster and your ideas on group goals and 
distribute them to everybody prior to our first actual meeting.   At that 
first meeting, we will talk through expectations of us and of each other, and 
the proposed goals.  
Please have your inputs to me by January 7.  I look forward to working with 
you.   ","Steve Kean's Ray Alvarez Sergio Assad Roy Boston Mike Grimes

847,"Got your message.  I'm testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovich 
is covering FERC.  I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context.  He 
said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are 
tripling.  Frankly, we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else.  But he 
also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Enron and others 
had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E 
(which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched.  
California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a 
deferral account).  I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't 
protect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the market 
based solutions.  One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers 
should be encouraged to choose.  Those who did are doing fine.","Dasovich

Sources: Edison Reworking Bond Sale
By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Edison International(NYSE:EIX <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=eix&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/eix.html>), in a last-ditch bid to stay solvent, is restructuring a $1.2 billion junk bond sale because investors are afraid of getting caught in a second big California utility bankruptcy, bond market analysts and investors said on Tuesday. 
Edison, the parent of cash-strapped utility Southern California Edison (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Southern%0ACalifornia%20Edison%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Southern%20California%20Edison&cs=nw>), is considering trimming its bond sale and adding a bank term loan, the analysts and investors said. 
Rosemead, California-based Edison needs cash this week as it struggles with California's power crisis, analysts said. The company is trying to rid itself of debt maturing this year, including a fully drawn down $618 million bank credit line expiring Saturday. 
The seven-year secured notes being sold by Mission Energy Holding Co. have not found enough buyers despite carrying yields as high as 13.5 percent, analysts said. That's more than four percentage points above the recent 9.33 percent yield on a typical junk-rated electric utility bond, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. 
``We were hearing it was significantly undersubscribed around midday when the deal was scheduled to price, so the assumption is it will resurface in another form, probably much cheaper and restructured,'' said John Atkins, a corporate bond analyst at IDEAglobal.com <http://IDEAglobal.com>, a New York-based research firm. 
In the utility's semi-weekly conference call with holders of defaulted SoCal Edison debt, Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci said Tuesday afternoon there is ``virtually nothing the company can say'' about the private bond sale. 
Goldman Sachs & Co., which sources said is arranging the bond sale, also declined to comment. 
Edison said earlier this month it intended to use bond sale proceeds to pay down the bank credit line, as well as $250 million of notes due July 18 and $350 million due Nov. 1. 
Mission Energy Holding, which Edison created specifically to raise cash, was designed to be shielded from any bankruptcy of SoCal Edison, Edison or Edison Mission Energy. Some investors have said they are concerned the shield may not prove strong enough. 
Moody's Investors Service rated Mission Energy Holding's notes ``Ba2,'' its second highest junk grade. Standard & Poor's, rated them ``BB-minus,'' one notch lower. 
SoCal Edison, which has defaulted on $931 million of bonds and commercial paper, ran up more than $5.4 billion of debt because California's utility deregulation blocked it from recouping its soaring wholesale power costs. It agreed in April with Gov. Gray Davis (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Gov.%20Gray%20Davis%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Gov.%20Gray%20Davis&cs=nw>) on a rescue plan, but regulators have been slow to implement it, and many legislators oppose it. 
The utility is California's second largest; the largest, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp.(NYSE:PCG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pcg&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/p/pcg.html>), filed for bankruptcy protection on April 6. 
Shares of Edison closed Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22New%20York%20Stock%0AExchange%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=York%20Stock%20Exchange>) at $11.24, down 33 cents.

We are working on a way to trick the system into getting it done. Otherwise, restructuring the way credit is done requires a major back-end rewrite. Given that we can only do so much at any one time and the amount of resources we are pouring into restrucuturing limit orders, I can't promise this any time soon unless we can do it within the existing framework. I will keep you posted.

You requested that I give you a list of things to avoid discussion with ABB.  We've maintained a reasonably open relationship with ABB up to this point, but here are some (fairly obvious) things that we should probably steer clear of:

1.  No discussion about Fronterra;
2.  No specifics about the DeAcero contract, e.g. extension date, CP's, etc; and
3.  No discussion about project credit issues or financing alternatives for the project.

When this ABB contingent was here last (Feb 2001), Dave and Janet essentially indicated that this was an important project to Enron, that we were entirely committed to seeing it through and that if it weren't for the damn CFE, we'd already be done, etc. etc.  I think if we stick to that line, we'll be fine.

If I think of anything else, I'll let you know ASAP.

We should monitor this transaction this week.

This week, more than $3 billion of sales have been slated. The largest comes from independent power producer Calpine Corp. (NYSE:CPN </quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=CPN>). It plans to sell $1.35 billion of bonds as part of a $2 billion financing drive after Moody's Investors Service last week upgraded its debt to investment-grade.
I would think it would give us some indication whether the credit markets are there or not.

Therefore, any proposed purchaser of the Indian Mesa facility must evaluate the contract based on their own legal and commercial interpretation.
 
I don't think it is productive to spend any more time on this discussion.   We will continue provide Enron Wind with the PPA value on a daily basis such that total shareholder value is maximized for any proposed wind transaction (sale of company and/or sale of IM project).

875,"Hey Louise, following are a few folks I would suggest making an extra effort to talk to in the very near future, although with the announcement of Duran I think he has already begun meeting with these guys. 

Ozzie Pagan-Ozzie Pagan-Ozzie Pagan
Bernie Aucoin-Head of Power Structuring
Janelle Scheur- NE mid-market
Michael Brown-NE orig.
Heather Kroll- SE orig.
Bruce Sukaly-TX orig.
Charlie Vetters/Mike Miller- Principal Investing

These gas guys could use a little attention:

Ed McMichael-Head of Gas Structuring
Frank Vickers-East gas orig.
Laura Luce-Chicago/Midwest gas

I talked with Delainey last night and asked him to talk with Duran which he did. Delainey also talked with Michael Brown and Janelle Scheur (I wasn't here). I talked with Ozzie this morning and Delainey is talking with him now. We've asked every one of these guys to stay calm and give this a chance to work. I do think they all have confidence in Duran so that's good. 

Personally, I think the Baughman announcement was a mistake. Baughman is a superb mid-market leader, but the NE isn't in need of that. Janelle can handle that role with no issues whatsoever. The NE needs a high-powered structured originator that will continue to build and really lead that business. The signal that was just sent with the Baughman announcement is that the NE will be a mid-market shop only (confirming the concerns already up there),  with no realistic capability of executing on the current business plan. 

Please let me know if there's anything more I can do. It really took a lot of work to get East Power finally set up like it needs to be, and I really hate to see it falling apart like this.  And remember, we have put out no ""bids"" for ANY individual within ENA or wholesale.

Hi Savita,
 
Attached is the ugly first cut at data for Canada. The sheets are a jumble of information, but the jist of it is this:
 
*Canada did a lot more activity on their NIT term physical products during the peak May-July00 period than they did during the low Nov00-Jan01 period. (3000 trades vs 1550 trades). 
 
*The only significant product offering difference between the two periods was the GD/D Sumas product, which was offered in May-July, but not Nov-Jan. (accounts for relatively few trades)
 
* Enron North America did a higher percentage of the trading on Canadian Gas products in Nov00-Jan01 than they did during the earlier months.
 
* There are a handful of counterparties such as Murphy Oil and Dynegy Marketing which conducted business with Canada on EOL before and since the Nov-Jan lull period, but did not do online transactions with us during the three months where our trade volumes and deal counts were lowest.

1.  We can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for Dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated, however if they think it works - fine.  We would not want the margin calculated net (it needs to be exclusive of this transaction).  If they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement, there is an accounting issue for us.

2.  In the East we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools.  We are short to them in the pools which clear financially and we have no issues in the pools.  So we do not need to do anything.  I'll have the west soon.

895,"John, below are several issues I wanted to bring to your attention prior to 
finalizing merit increases for East Power.  I have also given David Oxley the 
same information in order for you to discuss this morning when you meet.  
Call me if you have any questions.

 M. Dana Davis's employment agreement will expire in February 28, 2001.  I 
imagine we will want to renew with the new salary on the employment 
agreement.  K Presto would like to recommendation that we give him a $20,000 
increase.


Rogers Herndon' s employment agreement  will expire September 14, 2001.  Do 
we want to renew earlier and roll the base salary changes (if any) into the 
employment agreement. Kevin Presto would like to give him a $15,000 increase.


Who will be responsible for John Zufferli's increase (if any ) since he 
transferred to Canada and now has been promoted to VP.



Rob Benson was given a significant increase in the global comp system at the 
insistence of K.Presto.  Kevin states that John Lavorato indicated to him 
that Benson needed to be taken care of.  With that being said Kevin would 
like to bring him up more in line with a commerical director, which he was 
just promoted to.  His employment agreement will expire 2/1/01.  So would it 
also make sense to delete him from the merit database and renew an employment 
agreement rolling in his new salary?



Finally, I need you to decide on Chris Dorland's new salary.  He is currently 
making $81,000 and I have recommended $90,000.  He is an Associate that is 
being made a commerical manager.  He was ranked superior and Presto has 
indicated that he is expecting around $100,000.  Presto finally settled on 
$95,000 provided you concur.  Our plan prior was slightly stagger salaries 
for individuals as associates promoted to commercial manager based on final 
rankings.  ($85,000 strong, $87,500 for excellent, $90,000 for superior). The 
guideline from the program is $86,000 but is left up to the business unit 
discretion.  ",John David Oxley M. Dana Davis's K Presto Rogers Herndon Kevin Presto John Zufferli's Rob Benson Kevin John Lavorato Benson Chris Dorland's,"20,000 15,000 81,000 90,000 around $100,000 95,000 85,000 87,500 86,000","East Power the

900,"John,
The Policy was re-written in haste in the fall of 1998 (by some chump named 
seyfried) to attempt to incorporate a new paradigm in the way we managed our 
Merchant Portfolio.  The new paradigm never materialized for a number of 
reasons, leaving the Policy somewhat ambiguous.  We had been hesitant to 
change it given that we were never quite sure whether or not this thought 
process would be resurrected.  It appears that now would be a good time to 
consider changes to reflect current business practices and add clarity.  I 
will take a shot at it myself for the August Board meeting, however, I would 
prefer to do so with your and Lavo's input.  Please advise at your earliest 
convenience.
 On some specifics:
Officially, the EIP portfolio has never been used.  It was a holdover from 
the SPP (supply positioning pool) associated with the Sithe transaction.  
There have been those that have referenced EIP/SPP in the past, however, I 
believe that this was done so in error and not in compliance with Policy.
The Capital portfolio was originally intended to provide capital market 
hedges for the Merchant Portfolio and trade the stock of Enron Corp and other 
Enron Corp public entitiies (EOG) on an opportunistic basis.  The capital 
market transfer process has yet to take place (nor does it look like it is 
ever going to), therefore this portfolio has been used solely for the 
CFO/Treasurer to take mark-to-market postions in Enron.  
I will adjust the authorized trader list to reflect the oversight 
responsibility and the change of LNG to John.  
Thanks for your input.

Late October, Enron announced a change in the administrator for the Enron Savings Plan (our 401(k)s) and locked us out from making any changes in our asset allocations or contribution rules until November 20.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes closed lower on Friday due to disappointing earnings
forecasts, which offset more optimistic prospects for a recovery in
the economy. The NASDAQ gapped down on the open and closed this
week's gap crossing at 1925.15 before rebounding on light short
covering ahead of the close. Momentum indicators are bottoming and
hint that a low might be in or near following this week's bounce of
the 38% retracement level crossing at 1826.96 marked a short-term
bottom. The NASDAQ closed down 48.80 points at 1937.70. The March S&P
500 index also closed steady on Friday at 1133.30.

The Dow closed out the week on a high note on Friday due to growing
optimism about a recovery in the economy. Additional support came
from technical buying triggered by the Dow's ability to hold above
key fib support crossing at 9706.20. Short-term momentum indicators
are turning bullish from oversold conditions signaling that a low is
in or near. Closes above minor resistance crossing at 9857.70 are
needed to temper the bearish outlook in the market.

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

March T-bonds closed lower on Friday but off session lows due to a
short covering bounce ahead of the weekend. Early weakness was tied
to market expectations that the Federal Reserve will not be cutting
interest rates again when it meets next week. Today's mid-range close
leaves the door open for sideways trading on Monday. However,
momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower
prices are possible into early February. If the decline continues,
December's uptrend line crossing near 101-00 is March's next target.

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed higher on Friday due to strength in livestock,
some precious metals, fiber, some foods and energies. Friday's close
above the 50% retracement level of the October-January rally crossing
at 189.40 hints that a short-term bottom might be near. However,
closes above 191 will be needed before this can be confirmed. If this
decline continues, the 62% retracement level crossing at 187.85 is
the CRB's next target. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming
oversold hinting that a low might be in or is near.

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed higher on Friday although trading was
subdued as cash trading in the February contract wrapped up today.
Most traders upon completion of their deals for February remained on
the sidelines in no hurry to jump into the March contracts. Light
technical support came from ideas that the U.S. economy has bottomed
out and a recovery is beginning to take shape, which should
eventually manifest itself in higher energy demand later this year.

March crude oil extended its short covering rally on Friday closing
at broken uptrend line support crossing near 20.00. Multiple closes
above this broken support level are needed before a double bottom can
be confirmed. Stochastics and the RSI are turning bullish with this
week's rebound increasing the odds that a low is in or near.

March heating oil closed modestly higher on Friday but failed to
clear minor resistance marked by last week's high crossing at 54.70.
Closes above this resistance level are needed to increase the odds
that a short-term bottom has been posted. At the same time a number
of short-term momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that
a bottom has likely been posted.

March unleaded gas closed higher on Friday retracing 50% of this
month's decline this week. While short-term momentum indicators have
turned bullish signaling that a low has been posted, I would not be
surprised to see the market under some selling pressure on Monday as
rising inventories and weak demand will likely limit upside potential
near-term. Longer-term, I am looking for March to work its way higher
possibly testing the 62-cent area by early-February.

March Henry Hub natural gas closed slightly higher on Friday due to
light short covering as it consolidated some of its recent losses.
However, the door remains open for additional weakness into early
February with weekly support crossing at 1.76 marking a potential
target later this winter. Momentum indicators are oversold but
suggest that additional weakness near-term is possible.

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The March Dollar soared to new contract highs on Friday thereby
confirming Thursday's breakout above December's high crossing at
118.85. Today's rally was triggered by growing optimism of a recovery
in the U.S. economy that are better than the market had originally
thought after Fed Chairman Greenspan's speech on January 11. Today's
high spiked above key weekly resistance crossing at 120.11. If this
resistance level is cleared, last year's high crossing at 121.29 is
March's next upside target. While stochastics and the RSI are
becoming overbought, trend-following indicators such as the ADX are
ending a bullish mode signaling that additional strength is possible
this winter.

The March Swiss Franc plunged to new lows for the month against the
Dollar but fell short of testing December's spike low crossing at
.5797. A short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of
today's loss while leaving the door open for a possible inside day on
Monday. However, the daily ADX has entered a bearish mode signaling
that additional weakness near-term is likely into early-February.

The March Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower on Friday and below
broken support crossing at .6230 thereby ending this week's short
covering bounce. March's inability to sustain this week's breakout
above broken support crossing at .6230 leaves the door open for a
possible resumption of the decline off December's high. Today's sell
off turned a number of momentum indicators bearish once again
signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-
February.

The March Japanese Yen closed higher on Friday due to light short
covering as it consolidated some of this week's losses. However, the
rebound failed to test broken weekly support crossing at .7558
thereby leaving the door open for additional weakness near-term and a
possible test of the next level of long-term support crossing at
.7371. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional
weakness is likely. I am looking for a short-term bottom to be posted
by the middle of next week.

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

February gold closed modestly higher on Friday due to light short
covering ahead of the weekend as it consolidates above the 62%
retracement level of the December-January rally crossing at 278.70.
However, stochastics are bearish signaling that additional weakness
is possible into early- February. If the decline continues, the 75%
retracement level of this winter's rally crossing at 276 is
February's next target.

March silver closed higher on Friday due to technical short covering.
Access trading saw March test broken support marked by the 62%
retracement level of November's rally crossing at 4.327. A sell off
ahead of the close tempered today's gains leaving the door open for
sideways trading on Monday. If the decline resumes, the 75%
retracement level crossing at 4.221 marks the next downside target.
Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower
prices are possible into early February.

March copper posted a downside reversal due to light profit taking
ahead of the weekend. Early strength spiked above last week's high
crossing at 71.40. However, March needs to close above this minor
resistance level to temper the bearish outlook in the market. Until
then, this week's rebound is nothing more that a short covering
bounce. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their respective
overbought zones hinting that we could see additional pressure into
early-February.

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March corn closed fractionally lower on Friday despite a significant
increase in this week's export sales. Weekly export sales came in at
51.33 million bushels some 42% above the previous weeks pace. While
the sales number was impressive spillover weakness from soybeans
combined with a soaring U.S. Dollar rendered the report mute by the
close. Today's downside reversal leaves the market vulnerable to
additional weakness on Monday especially if the dry regions across
southern Brazil receive much needed rain over the weekend. From a
broad perspective, the corn market continues to carve out what
appears to be a major bottom as long-term fundamentals indicate that
prices are too cheap. I suspect that the corn market will struggle to
stay afloat into mid- February when the mid-winter low is due to be
posted.

March wheat closed fractionally higher on Friday, as much improved
export sales this week helped to underpin today's rally. Additional
support came from extended weather forecasts for next week, which are
calling for significantly lower temperatures across the Plains that
could burn back some stands. However, a soaring U.S. Dollar along
with weakness in soybeans and corn limited today's rally. Momentum
indicators remain bearish despite this week's bounce indicating that
additional weakness is possible into early-February. I am still
looking for one more break to new lows for the month with the
late-December reaction low crossing at 2.83 marking the next likely
downside target.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March soybeans posted a key reversal down on Friday. Revised weather
forecasts for Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul state have increased the
amount of expected rainfall for this region over the weekend, which
triggered today's sell off. Additional pressure came from rumors that
China would be out of the U.S. soybean market until at least April
because of the implementation of rules on GMO soybeans. Session lows
fell short of testing gap support crossing at 4.28 1/2 and extending
down to 4.26 3/4. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that
additional weakness is possible into the first half of February when
a mid-winter low is due to be posted.

March soybean meal posted a downside reversal on Friday thereby
setting the stage for additional weakness on Monday especially if
South America receives rain over the weekend. If the decline off last
week's high resumes, gap support crossing at 147.90 is March's next
likely downside target. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling
that additional weakness is possible into early-February.

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

April hogs closed higher on Friday but ran into stiff resistance
marked by the broken uptrend line drawn across the December-January
lows. Closes above or below this week's trading range are needed to
clear up near-term direction in the market. This afternoon's monthly
hogs and pigs report showed the December 2001 pig crop at 8.07
million head up 3% from the previous year. Farrowing were up 2% over
last year and litter size rose to 8.8 pigs per litter compared to
8.66 pigs per litter last year. Talk of steady to higher cash bids
for Monday leaves the door open for a steady to higher opening in
April futures.

April cattle closed higher for the Third day in a row on Friday as it
spiked to a new high for the year. Support came from next week's
winter weather forecast and higher cash bids for slaughter-ready
cattle. Today's spiked to new highs for the month hint that cattle
producers might be gaining the upper hand in the market as market
ready cattle supplies are likely to decline into February. If April
extends this week's rally next week, October's high at 75.45 is
April's next target. Momentum indicators are turning bullish hinting
that the cattle market is poised for one more drive to new highs for
the winter.

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

March coffee closed into new lows for the week on Friday amidst
increased fund selling and producer hedging ahead of the weekend.
Forecast calling for increased chances for precip across portions of
Brazil's coffee growing region only adds to the bearish tone of the
market as expectations for a record coffee crop continue to grow.
Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower
prices are likely into the end of January. This sets the stage for a
possible test of this winter's low crossing at 44.75 later this
winter.

March cocoa closed higher on Friday amidst lackluster trading as it
ended a one-day setback with today's higher close. Short-term
momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices are possible near-term. However, closes above 1422 or below
1260 are needed to confirm a breakout of this winter's trading range.

March sugar closed higher on Friday due to short covering ahead of
the weekend. Early weakness saw March fall just short of testing
December's low crossing at 690. However, March's inability to test
this support level along with today's high-range close leaves the
door open for additional short covering on Monday. Closes above this
week's gap crossing at 730 would signal that a short-term bottom has
likely been posted.

March cotton closed higher on Friday due to short covering ahead of
the weekend despite today's disappointing export sales report. The
report showed net cotton sales of 99,000 bales, which was well below
last week's level and the 4-week average. However, this week's sell
off largely discounted the drop off in sales. Nevertheless, momentum
indicators remain bearish signaling that a test of trading range
support crossing near 34.91 is possible later this month.

Printing Paper Corporation (Ream). In October 1994, the
Company issued its shares to its shareholders in exchange for
assets in another company. Ream was then spun off. The
exchange was accomplished under Rule 504 of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 and a Form D
was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In November 2000, the Company changed its name to Single
Source Financial Services Corporation. The current control
group of shareholders, which includes the officers, directors,
and their spouses, took control of the Company on July 24,
2000 in a private transaction

The Company is currently offering, or is in negotiations to
offer, the following products and or services:

* Electronic Transaction Processing Equipment
Single Source Financial Services Corporation sells electronic
transaction processing equipment to merchants who wish to
offer credit card and debit card payment options to their
customers.  The Company utilizes an outside leasing company
to provide those merchants who elect not to purchase the
equipment with the option of a lease.  Leasing accounts for
the majority of the Company's income from these activities.

The Company is actively pursuing either the acquisition or
formation of a leasing company. By cutting out the
""middle-man"" and carrying its own leases, the Company
expects to dramatically increase revenues.

* Credit Card Processing Service
Single Source Financial Services Corporation currently
markets and sells the credit card processing services of
CardReady International, Inc.

The Company has secured an option to acquire CardReady
International, Inc.  If the acquisition is completed, the
Company will be able to provide processing services directly
to its own customers.  The Company will then also be able to
act as a third-party processor to independent sales
organizations around the country.

The Company's websites are located at
www.mysinglesource.com and  www.cardready.com.

* Analyst Summary

The credit card processing market has reached explosive levels
in the last few years.  In 1999 and 2000, industry-wide,
card-based payments increased by 16% and 14% respectively,
with debit card usage leading the way in growth.  In the year
2000, card-based payments represented 29% of all domestic
payment transactions.  By the year 2010, it is estimated that
card-based payments will represent almost 50% of all
domestic payment transactions.
With the acquisition of a processor (CardReady International,
Inc.), the Company will be able to dramatically increase its
processing revenues as well as its market share.  CardReady
International's sales and marketing operations are currently
adding more than 100 to 200 new accounts per month, each
worth from $500 to $1,000 in annual income.  Further, the
Company is in negotiations with independent sales
organizations to add more that 1,000 new accounts per
month.

Single Source Financial Services Corporation plans to expand
its operations to include various other financial products and
services. Once this is accomplished, the Company will be able
to effectively cross-sell to its ever-expanding client base.    As
credit cards have become the main method of payment for
goods and services , the credit card processing market has
realized explosive growth.  Single Source Financial Services
Corporation has positioned itself to capitalize on new market
opportunities by targeting a growing market sector largely left
untapped by bigger providers: Small to mid-sized businesses.

WSJ(1/14)Heard On The Street:Enron Ex-CEO Made Bet Vs. Rival 		

01/13/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)


  By Ken Brown 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

When Jeffrey Skilling resigned as chief executive of Enron Corp. in mid-August, he said he wanted to spend more time with his three children. ""I've missed too many soccer games over the years,"" he told his brother Tom soon after he quit. 

But instead of standing on the sidelines, Mr. Skilling stayed in the game, making a big, speculative stock-market bet against an Enron rival. 

A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling confirms that he made the wager: a short sale initiated on Aug. 24 against shares of AES Corp., a big energy producer. A person familiar with the matter puts the trade's value at $30 million, though Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the estimate is ""way out of the ballpark"" on the high side. 

The bet came as AES's shares were tumbling, and, depending on when it was closed out, could have netted him a profit of more than $15 million. Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman, Judy Leone, confirms he did make a profit on the trade but won't say how much or when the trade was closed out. ""There is a category of personal financial information that we're going to respect Mr. Skilling's privacy on,"" Ms. Leone says. 

As CEO of Enron, which made most of its money trading in the volatile energy markets, Mr. Skilling was used to taking on risk. He pushed the company into several unproven businesses, including the trading of bandwidth, or network capacity, a market that ultimately didn't prove successful for the Houston company. Enron itself reveled in a swashbuckling attitude that ultimately contributed to its downfall; the company has been under bankruptcy-court protection since early last month. 

But a bet of this type was exceptionally risky. In short sales, investors borrow shares of a stock and sell them, hoping the stock will fall so they can replace the shares with cheaper ones. Such trades are riskier than buying a company's shares directly, because if the stock rises strongly, an investor with a short position on the shares can be forced to ""cover"" the bet at a sky-high cost. 

As it turns out, AES shares, along with those of other energy companies, fell steadily in the month after Mr. Skilling's resignation. Then on Sept. 26, AES stock tanked, falling by nearly 50%, when the company announced it wouldn't meet analysts' earnings estimates for 2001. If Mr. Skilling had maintained his short bet through that date, he could have earned better than 60% on his investment. 

AES, based in Arlington, Va., blamed the earnings shortfall in part on the fall in the Brazilian currency. AES wouldn't comment on Mr. Skilling's trading. ""Commenting on another company's now-departed executive's behavior is not a comment I think we ought to make,"" says Kenneth Woodcock, a company spokesman. 

Mr. Skilling's bet raises the question about whether he knew anything special about AES's business because of his work at Enron. Ms. Leone, his spokeswoman, says Mr. Skilling shorted the AES shares based on a July 30 page-one article in The Wall Street Journal that said AES was having trouble in its big Brazilian operations and would be hurt by the fall in the Brazilian currency. Based on information in the article and his general knowledge about how business in Brazil worked, he felt that the company's stock might fall in price. His trading decision was ""absolutely not"" based on any nonpublic information he had obtained while an Enron executive, she says. 

AES did trade energy with Enron, but only a small amount and only as a way to sell its output, rather than to earn a profit, according to Mr. Woodcock. He adds that there would be no obvious way for Mr. Skilling to have gained any unique or valuable knowledge about AES through Enron's dealings with his company. 

The trade was made through Mr. Skilling's account at Charles Schwab & Co., the big discount broker, and it created a buzz inside the firm's San Francisco offices. After the position was taken, ""we checked up on it a couple of days later, and a couple of days after that, and said, oh, it went down,"" says the person familiar with the trade. 

At the time of Mr. Skilling's resignation, Schwab executives in their newly opened private-client office in Houston were trying to sell Mr. Skilling on a plan to hedge the value of his Enron stock, the person says. Schwab executives in San Francisco had created an elaborate presentation for the hedging strategy, called a collar, but Mr. Skilling never acted on it, a decision that may have cost him millions, the person says. Mr. Skilling wouldn't comment on the collar proposal. 

At the time of his resignation on Aug. 14, the 1.1 million Enron shares that Mr. Skilling owned outright were worth about $47 million. He also had 500,000 vested options that were in the money, meaning their exercise price was below the stock's share price at the time. Mr. Skilling has said he sold about 500,000 of the shares he owned outright on Sept. 17, when the stock market reopened following the terrorist attacks. That sale would have netted him about $15 million, based on that day's volatile prices. 

His remaining 600,000 shares are worth $408,000 at Enron's current share price of 68 cents, and his options are worthless. Just accounting for the 600,000 shares he owns outright, the collar proposed by Schwab could have saved Mr. Skilling more than $30 million. 

Interestingly, professional investors often will try to hedge a big positive bet on a company in any given industry by shorting shares of a rival, on the theory that if the entire industry tumbles, the gains on the short sale would offset the losses on the long position. But Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the trade wasn't a hedge, adding that it was the ""first and only time"" he made a short sale and that right now the only stock Mr. Skilling owns is Enron. ""If he thought the stock price was going down he could have sold all his Enron shares; he didn't,"" Ms. Leone says. 

Enron and Schwab, which were often paired in magazine articles touting America's most innovative companies, had at least one minor business relationship. Schwab had handled a small portion of Enron's 401(k) called the ""brokerage window,"" which allowed employees to buy mutual funds not offered in the company's plan, as well as individual stocks for their 401(k)s. The relationship ended in July when Enron made some administrative changes to the plan and Schwab was replaced. 

Mr. Skilling isn't the only member of his family to suffer because of Enron's collapse. His brother Tom a Chicago television weatherman, bought 750 shares of Enron at $49 early last year ""because of these incredible analyst reviews"" of the company. He says he sold them in the fall at $27 to buy some land. ""Little did I know if I stuck with it I would have a 60-cent stock,"" he says in an interview from his vacation home in Alaska. 

He says his father suffered more: He bought 2,000 shares of Enron last year and still holds them. ""You wonder what in God's name were the analysts doing,"" Tom Skilling says. ""There were a lot of people lulled into, I don't know what, a comatose state.""

Nineteen IP Phone Manufacturers Select TI DSP-Based Technologies To Speed
IP Phone Deployment=1DTI's Integrated Silicon and Software Powers 80% of th=
e IP
Phone Market

DALLAS, May 30, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Leveraging the processing
performance and low power of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) (TI=
)
technologies to rapidly deploy enterprise Internet Protocol (IP) telephone
solutions, 19 new customers have selected TI as their vendor. The integrati=
on of
TI's programmable digital signal processors (DSPs) and Telogy Software(TM)
products provides the required performance, ultra-low power efficiency and
flexibility to execute voice encoding and compression, while saving system =
costs
and reducing overall power consumption. (see: http://www.ti.com/sc/ipphone =
)

The new customers include ACT, ADTech, AltiGen Communications, BONA Technol=
ogy,
Cetacean Networks, Telefonica, Global Internet Telephone AG(GITel). TI now =
has
more than 50 enterprise IP phone customers including 3Com Corporation, Asco=
m,
CIDCO, Circa Communications/Polycom, Cisco Systems, congruency, Ericsson, N=
ortel
Networks and TelStrat.

""One of the reasons we chose TI's enterprise IP phone solution is because o=
f the
complete integration of TI's programmable DSP technology with TI's Telogy
Software products,"" said Richard De Soto, Chief Marketing Officer of AltiGe=
n
Communications Inc. ""The software enables the delivery of better-
than-toll-quality voice and the complete solution delivers the programmabil=
ity
into new evolving standards. It is just what we were looking for as we made=
 our
investment in the underlying technology for our AltiServ IP PBX and IP phon=
es.""

Enterprise IP phones are one of the most rapidly growing forms of Internet
telephony. In fact, Allied Business Intelligence research predicts that the=
 IP
phone market will reach 51.4 million 2005. And according to a recent study =
by
Phillips InfoTech, IP Local Area Network (LAN) telephony represents the nex=
t
generation of phone systems. For most enterprises the decision to implement=
 IP
LAN telephony is really a question of 'when' not a question of 'if.' ""

The potential obstacles most often cited by decision-makers in both large a=
nd
small enterprises regarding the timeframe for deciding to implement IP LAN
telephony are: reliability, voice quality, price and scalability, according=
 to
the Phillips InfoTech study.

""With TI, Cetacean Networks has solved the problems surrounding the deploym=
ent
of new revenue generating, real-time applications and services to meet the
capacity and scalability of new telephony and real-time networks,"" said Ste=
ven
Rogers, President and CEO, Cetacean Networks.

Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal proces=
sing
and analog technologies, the semiconductor engines of the Internet age. The
company's businesses also include materials and controls, and educational a=
nd
productivity solutions. TI is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and has
manufacturing or sales operations in more than 25 countries.

Texas Instruments is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol=

The STOCK INDEXES closed higher on Friday due to a rebound in
technology stocks. The Nasdaq extended its rebound off Wednesday's
low but failed to fill this week's gap crossing at 2170.58 thereby
leaving the door open for sideways to lower prices during the first
half of June. Momentum indicators also remain bearish indicating that
the late week rebound in both indexes appears to be nothing more than
light short covering ahead of the weekend. If the declines resume
next week, May's reaction lows are potential targets.

The Dow posted a key reversal up due to a rebound in blue chip
stocks. Intel continued to pace the gainers among the Dow's
components up 5.3%. The Dow's other three technology components were
also higher on the day. Additional gains on Monday are needed to
confirm today's bullish reversal pattern, which would then strongly
suggest that the setback off May's high might have come to an end.

INTEREST RATES September bonds closed sharply higher on Friday and
above this spring's downtrend line crossing near 100-26 thereby
signaling that a short-term bottom has been posted. I would not be
surprised to see a modest setback on Monday as September might try
and consolidate some of this week's gains. Early weakness was tied to
the above-consensus May employment report. However, today's National
Association of Purchasing Management's data, which continues to show
weakness in manufacturing triggered a rally into the close. Momentum
indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices into early-June are possible.

The CRB INDEX closed higher on Friday due to strength in grains,
meats, precious metals, foods and fiber. The CRB ended the week above
April's low crossing at 208.87 and may have marked a double bottom
this week. Momentum indicators are bearish but oversold hinting that
a short-term bottom might be in or near. Closes below this week's low
would confirm a breakout below this spring's trading range while
opening the door for a larger-degree decline into June.

ENERGY MARKETS were mostly lower on Friday as Iraq indicate that it
would continue oil exports this month under prior contracts, despite
its rejection of a one-month extension of the oil-for-food deal.

July crude oil posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday with
session lows falling short of testing the 50% retracement level of
the December/May rally crossing at 27.51. Momentum indicators are
bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible. If
the decline continues, the late-April reaction low crossing at 27.25
is July's next target.

July heating oil posted an inside day with a lower close and a
breakout below the 38% retracement level of the December/May rally
crossing at 75.66. If the decline continues, May's reaction low
crossing at 74.55, which coincides with the 50% retracement level of
this spring's rally is July's next target. Momentum indicators remain
bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices into early- June are
possible.

July unleaded gas posted a downside reversal on Friday after early
strength tied to spillover short covering from Thursday's high-range
close faded in afternoon trading. Momentum indicators remain bearish
signaling that sideways to lower prices into next week are possible.
However, ongoing concerns over summer gasoline supplies are likely to
limit downside risk in the market.

July Henry Hub natural gas posted a quiet inside day with a slightly
higher close on Friday as it consolidates above last October's low
crossing at 3.86. Closes below this key support level would open the
door for a possible test of the 62% retracement level of the 1999-01
rally crossing at 3.64 later this spring. The daily ADX (a
trend-following indicator) is bearish however, momentum indicators
are oversold hinting that a pause in this spring's decline is
possible.

CURRENCIES The September Dollar closed lower on Friday due to light
profit taking ahead of the weekend. The mid-range close leaves the
door open for sideways to higher prices on Monday as the door has
been opened for additional gains during the first half of June. If
this week's rally continues, weekly resistance that crosses at
121.58, which marks the 50% retracement level of the 1985/1992
decline is September's next target later this spring. The daily ADX
(a trend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that additional
weakness is possible.

The September Swiss Franc posted a quiet inside day with a higher
close on Friday as it consolidated below broken support crossing at
.5643. If the decline continues, a test of weekly support crossing at
.5508 is possible later this month. The daily ADX (a trend-following
indicator) signals that additional weakness is possible.

The September Canadian Dollar closed higher on Friday and is poised
to test this spring's high crossing at .6541. Multiple closes above
this resistance level are needed to renew this spring's rally.
Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that additional gains early
next week are possible.

The September Japanese Yen closed higher on Friday but near session
lows due to light short covering ahead of the close. Nevertheless,
this week's rally has confirmed a breakout above this spring's
trading range crossing at .8425 thereby opening the door for
additional gains into early-June. Momentum indicators are bullish
signaling that additional gains next week are possible.

PRECIOUS METALS August gold closed higher on Friday due to light
short covering ahead of the weekend. Nevertheless, August has broken
out below April's uptrend line thereby opening the door for a test of
this spring's low crossing at 257.30 later this month. Stochastics
and RSI remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible
next week.

July silver also closed higher on Friday due to light short covering
ahead of the weekend. While today's mid-range close leaves the door
open for sideways trading on Monday, momentum indicators remain
bearish signaling that additional weakness during the first half of
June is possible. If the decline continues, May's low at 4.315 is a
target.

July copper ended the week on a low note while posting an inside day.
Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that a test of May's low
at 74.75 is likely next week. Multiple closes below this support
level would confirm a breakout below this spring's trading range
thereby opening the door for a test of weekly support crossing at
74.10 later this month.

GRAINS July corn gapped above May's downtrend line and closed higher
on Friday due to massive fund short covering. While today's export
sales report of 30 million bushels was below expectations, rising
concerns over slow crop development due to cool/wet weather are
gaining attention by the market. With funds holding a huge short
position in the market, any additional bullish news will only lead to
additional short covering. I would not be surprised to see some
consolidation on Monday as traders wait for the latest planting
progress and crop conditions reports before taking additional profits
on their short positions. Today's rally turned the ADX down, which is
often associated with a market that is bottoming. From a broader
perspective, the corn market has posted a key reversal on the weekly
chart. Additional gains next week are needed to confirm this
potentially bullish reversal pattern.

July wheat also gapped up and closed higher on Friday following this
week's bullish export sales report, which showed over 18 million
bushels in new crop sales. Additional support came from increased
concerns over disease problems with the Kansas winter wheat crop.
Session highs tested May's downtrend line crossing at 2.72. Closes
above this resistance level would open the door for a larger-degree
rebound during June. Momentum indicators have also turned bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices near-term are possible.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans gapped above last week's high crossing
at 4.53 1/2 and closed higher on Friday due to fund short covering.
Increased concerns over the cool/wet weather, which has enveloped
much of the Midwest thereby raising concerns over emergence and
planting progress has underpinned this week's rally. Profit taking
ahead of the close could lead to further consolidation on Monday.
However, weekly momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling
that sideways to higher prices during June are possible. If the rally
continues, March's high crossing at 4.77 3/4 is July's next target.

July soybean meal closed lower on Friday despite this week's stellar
export sales report of some 257,000 metric tonnes, which was well
above pre-report estimates. Bulls should note today's downside
reversal, as the market has not responded well to friendly news. This
suggests that most of if not all of the bullish demand news might
have already been factored into prices. Stochastics and RSI have
turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices on Monday are
possible. It will take closes above 168 to renew this spring's rally.

LIVESTOCK August hogs closed sharply higher for the fourth day in a
row filling April's gap crossing at 64.90. The stage is set for
additional gains and a likely test of April's high crossing at 65.95
later this month. This week's rally underpinned by fund buying is due
in part to futures discount to the cash market and ideas that loin
prices should bottom next week. Momentum indicators are bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices into early-June are
possible.

August cattle closed out the week on a high note as the stage is set
for a test of January's high crossing at 75.00 next week. The
discount of futures to the cash market along with higher cash bids
this week continues to underpin August's rally. Momentum indicators
are bullish but have become overbought warning traders to use caution
as a top may be near.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Friday due to light short
covering ahead of the weekend. However, a sell off ahead of the close
tempered much of today's early gains leaving the door open for
sideways to lower prices next week. This week's breakout into new
contract lows has opened the door for a test of long-term support
crossing at 51.70 later this month.

July cocoa closed higher on Friday due to light short covering
following Thursday's breakout below trading range support crossing at
955. Momentum indicators remain bearish despite their oversold
condition hinting that additional weakness into early-June is
possible. If the decline continues, the 75% retracement level at 862
is July's next target.

July sugar closed higher on Friday due to light short covering as it
consolidates around the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally
crossing at 857. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices next week is still possible. If the decline
continues, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.

July cotton extended this week's short covering rally as it
consolidates above psychological support crossing at 40- cents. Light
support came from today's export sales report that came in at 107,300
bales. Additional support came from news of some 300,000 to 350,000
acres of west Texas cotton being destroyed by flooding. However,
upside potential remains limited due to this year's burdensome
carryout levels, which are expected to grow in the coming year.

KKD:  Krispy Kreme Doughnuts has been on our target short watch list for
many days and, in fact, we have shorted many times, waiting patiently for
new low risk opportunities.  The above is a weekly chart.  Although no
doubt that KKD is in a powerful uptrend, it is simply overbought on
multiple time frames.  As you can see, the weekly bar closed with a
Japanese ""hanging man,"" a short-term reversal signal after an extended
run.  Last Friday's bar was a huge bearish engulfing bar, also suggesting
lower prices.  The daily OBV, RSI, CCI, MADC Histogram, stochastics, money
flow, and price volume trend are all overbought and rolling over.  The red
rising trend line gives a target between 62-63, just above the 38.2%
Fibonacci retracement shows from the low on the week of 4/6.  this is alto
where a prior overbought reversal area failed; however, the ""measured
move"" from that failure has been satisfied with last week's gains.  The
most recent runup was partially due to short covering.  KKD had
approximately 28 millinon shares outstanding after the march split,
although only 11.5 million were eligible for trading.  By the end of
April, another 14.8 million shares were released from lock up.  As of
mid-May, short interest had fallen to 5.9 million shares from a peak of
9.9 million in mid-March.  Those shorts undoubtedly felt great pain, but
the technicals are suggesting that the buying euphoria is coming to an
end.  Horizontal support with a 50% Fibonacci retracement would give a
target around 52-53.  Consider SHORTING KKD with a limit of 71.25.
Suggested target is OPEN.  Suggested stop is 72.70.

MyPoints Returns Finances to an Upright Position

At first glance, this deal sounds as appealing as airline food:
Pending approval, the online subsidiary of United Airlines will buy
MyPoints, an ""incentive marketing"" company that gives redeemable
shopping points to users who jump through hoops such as reading
targeted e-mail.

Seems weird, but InternetNews.com suggested the deal makes some sense.
""Like several of its competitors, San Francisco-based MyPoints has
found airlines and travel companies to be some of the most receptive
to its offerings,"" said InternetNews.com's Christopher Saunders,
noting that MyPoints' clients include Continental and Alaskan
Airlines.

Forbes.com predicted that ""large companies desperate to beef up their
Internet activities"" buying ""promising but beaten-down dot-coms"" will
become a trend. The New York Times, on the other hand, pointed out
that United is building its Net arm at a time when other companies are
closing or reabsorbing their Internet units. Forbes added that United
opened its online venture a mere seven months ago - well, that's seven
months sooner than Wal-Mart launched its ISP.

United would pay $2.60 a share for MyPoints stock, a price observers
seemed to consider mile-high. ""News of the deal sent shares of
MyPoints leaping 96 cents, to $2.56,"" said CBS MarketWatch. ""It should
have ... the offer comes at a 62.5 percent premium to Friday's closing
price and a whopping 420 percent premium to the stock's 52-week low.""
The New York Times took a good news/bad news approach, saying $2.60
""is well below the $88.50 it sold for in December 1999, but quite a
lot better than the 50 cents that MyPoints shares hit in March.""

Either way, MyPoints is unprofitable, and the online advertising
market in general has seen better days. Forbes.com did the best
debunking job, under the incredulous headline ""United Airlines Buys
Tiny Direct Marketing Firm."" Reporter Lisa DiCarlo wondered how many
of MyPoints' 16 million subscribers are active members, whether the
two companies' subscriber lists overlap much, and how MyPoints'
proprietary technology is supposed to work for United.

Another mystery remains: United told InternetNews.com that it is
interested in linking MyPoints' marketing services with UAL's
frequent-flier club, while the New York Times reported that United
won't merge its frequent-flier program with the MyPoints reward
program. ""The typical MyPoints user does not fly often enough to make
airline miles valuable to them,"" said the Times. ""But United will
offer travel discounts as rewards for MyPoints points."" Can we apply
the points to better airline food instead? - Jen Muehlbauer

Week Ending June 1, 2001

IN THIS ISSUE:
* Company Highlight : DXStorm.com (CDNX - DXS)
* News Links : This Week's Small-Cap Highlights

COMPANY SPOTLIGHT : DXStorm.com (CDNX - DXS)

In October and November of 2000, InvestNewswire sent you
information on DXStorm.com, an up-and-coming  e-commerce
Application Service Provider (ASP). This week, DXStorm's
president, Mr. Gregory Lowes, included a special message
with their third quarter results. We have attached it for
your benefit.

I am pleased to report that the company's third quarter
has yielded positive results.

Operating revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001
decreased approximately 10% over the prior quarter to
$178,000 as compared to $198,000 for the quarter ended
December 31, 2000. Operating revenues are all revenues
for e-commerce service packages and related revenues, and
other revenues from custom development, collocation,
hosting and other service fees.

In the second quarterly report, I stated that management
expected a reduction in monthly operating expenses of 50%
to be achieved by the end of the quarter ended March 31,
2001. I am pleased to report that the monthly target has
been achieved, and further that expenditures for the entire
quarter decreased to $647,000, a reduction of 48% from the
previous quarter. The loss for the quarter of $464,000, or
$0.02 per share, reflects a 54% reduction of the loss over
the previous quarter.

The company has taken extensive measures to manage costs
and expenditures without compromising its ability to
operate or fulfill its obligations to its clients and
partners. DXStorm remains capable of attracting, and is
prepared to take on, further major Brand Partners. As
reported previously, DXStorm remains focused on its
partners, past and upcoming, as the most predominant
source of new subscribers and revenues.

The management of DXStorm was introduced to the management
of Peachtree Network Inc. in early April of this year.
Through the course of many discussions and meetings, both
management teams recognized what we believe to be strong
synergies and opportunities between the companies.

On April 23, 2001, Peachtree Network Inc. announced that
it had entered into an agreement to acquire all the
outstanding shares of DXStorm. Further, through a secured,
convertible debenture, Peachtree would provide $750,000 in
funds to DXStorm in installments until June 30, 2001. The
transaction to acquire the shares of DXStorm is subject to
the completion of due diligence by both companies, final
board approvals, and approval by regulatory authorities.

Peachtree is an e-commerce ASP similar in many ways to
DXStorm. Peachtree has focused on the grocery sector, and
specifically on the larger businesses out of reach of
DXStorm (Sobeys, and Intermarche as examples). Peachtree is
now migrating their solutions to address the other 'large
surface' retail sectors. By combining the strengths of both
companies, management believes the opportunities for growth
far exceeds those of the two companies standing alone.
Specifically, management has identified several driving
factors for the proposed acquisition of DXStorm by
Peachtree:

** Wider product / services base (all retailers from very
small through DXStorm's Partners, to very large
multinational retailers with thousands of stores - the
products / services, personnel, and strategy of each of
DXStorm and Peachtree are expected to remain as the
companies join their operations).

** Collectively reduced costs in the short and long terms.

** Increased global market access for DXStorm products
through Peachtree's global network and relationships.

** Increased collective marketing and sales capabilities.

** More rapid deployment and development of services
through technology and expertise exchange.

** Stronger management to further increase sales and
business development activities.

** Synergies and opportunities through a number of
mutual relationships.

The recent 'dot-com melt down' has confirmed to management
that the focus on serving 'bricks and mortar' businesses is
correct and is, in fact, critical to growth. While the
state of the public markets has contributed to removing many
competitors from our sector, the embrace of e-commerce and
ASP delivered Information Technology services continues to
expand rapidly. The management of both companies believes
that our growth opportunities are far greater as a joint
force with merged strategy and execution in this growing
market.

Our joint business plan anticipates profitability in less
than 18 months based on a conservative three-year deployment
of existing contracts only (Sympatico-Lycos, Sobeys,
Intermarche, and others). However, continued sales and
business development efforts, driving factors in the union
of the two companies, are expected to shorten that path to
profitability while dramatically increasing value for
shareholders of both companies.

The STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS

The NASDAQ and S&P 500 were steady to lower overnight due to light
profit taking as investors used cautious comments from Hewlett-
Packard and J.P. Morgan as an excuse to take some money off the table
after a four-day run on Wednesday. Both the Nasdaq and Sept. S&P
remain range bound and will need to close above May's high or below
last week's lows to clear up near-term direction in the markets.
Meanwhile, the Dow posted an inside day with a lower close on
Wednesday as it consolidated some of its gains off last Friday's low.
However, momentum indicators have turned neutral to bullish signaling
that additional gains during June are possible. If there are no major
surprises in this morning's unemployment report, I am looking for the
Dow to trade steady to higher today.

European markets were mixed in overnight trading as German
unemployment for May was well above expectations that led to a modest
setback in the DAX-30. The UK FTSE-100 was up 17.00 points at 5918.50
while the German DAX-30 was down 12.06 points at 6180.38 as of 11:00
BST.

The Nikkei closed higher overnight as investors were encouraged by
better-than-expected April machinery orders data. Overnight gains led
to the posting of an upside reversal as the Nikkei consolidates above
the 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995. Additional gains on
Friday are needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern, which
would increase the odds that a short-term bottom may be in place.
Momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral to bullish
hinting that a short-term bottom might be in or near. The Nikkei
closed up 103 points to 13,278.

INTEREST RATES

September bonds were lower overnight and are working on a possible
inside day due to light profit taking. Trading was rather subdued as
most market participants stayed on the sidelines to wait for the
London session's open amidst a lack of fresh news. If the rebound off
last week's low continues, the 38% retracement level of this spring's
decline crossing at 101-15 then the 50% retracement level crossing at
102-16 are potential targets later this month. Momentum indicators
remain bullish signaling that additional short-term gains are
possible.

The German bond market or Bunds were lower overnight in thin trading
as they are due to expire on Friday. Trading was subdued as traders
await news from today's European Central Bank conference at 12:30
GMT. The June Bunds were last down 0.01 at 106.81. Sept. Bunds
started the day down 0.02 at 95.835, will be the front contract next
week.

Japanese government bonds closed slightly higher overnight in narrow
trading. The bond market took its cue from the Nikkei's movements and
was supported by Japan's unchanged bearish economic outlook. The lead
June 10-year JGB futures closed at 140.55 yen, up 0.05 as of 1510 JT.

The ENERGY MARKETS were lower in overnight trading following the
release of this week's DOE data report that showed that crude oil and
distillate supplies rose last week. In other news, OPEC Secretary
General, Ali Rodriguez indicated that he though a small increase in
output would be likely in the third quarter of this year.

July crude oil was lower overnight following this week's bearish
inventory data, which showed an increase in stocks compared with
expectations for a decline in stocks by the trade. Wednesday's key
reversal down fell short of testing this year's uptrend line, which
crosses near 27.10. However, overnight losses have set the stage for
a possible test of this support level by the end of the week.
Momentum indicators are bearish but nearing their respective oversold
zones warning traders to use caution as a short-term bottom might be
near.

July heating oil was lower overnight following Wednesday's key
reversal down. July gapped lower on the night session's open and
extended losses throughout the overnight. Closes below Wednesday's
low would set the stage for a test of May's reaction low crossing at
74.55. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to
lower prices during the first half of June are possible.

July unleaded gas was lower overnight following Wednesday's trendline
breakout and close below the 50% retracement level of this year's
rally crossing at 88.93. Additional weakness during the day session
could lead to a test of the 62% retracement level crossing at 85.62
later this month. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices near-term are still possible.

July Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight following this week's
bearish AGA inventory data report that showed U.S. natural gas
inventory rose by 117 billion cubic feet last week. This report eased
fears of rising energy demand due to warmer temps across the south.
Momentum indicators are turning bearish once again hinting that a
test of last week's low is possible. Closes below this support level
would renew this year's decline while opening the door for a possible
test of the 62% retracement level of the 1999/2001 rally crossing at
3.64 later this month.

CURRENCIES

The September Euro is working on a possible inside day but was
slightly lower overnight following Wednesday's key reversal down.
Closes below 84.16 would renew this spring's decline during June.
Momentum indicators are oversold but neutral to bearish thereby
leaving the door open for additional weakness.

The September British Pound plunged to a new 15-year low overnight
following Wednesday's trading range breakout. Overnight losses led to
a close below weekly chart support that crosses at 139.52. If the
decline continues, the February 1986 low at 136 is the Pound's next
target later this spring. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling
sideways to lower prices are possible near-term.

The September Swiss Franc was lower overnight as it extended
Wednesday's key reversal down. A lower close during the day session
is needed to confirm yesterday's bearish chart pattern, as the Franc
is poised to renew this spring's decline. Closes into new lows would
set the stage for a possible test of weekly chart support crossing at
.5508 later this year. The ADX (a trend-following indicator) is
turning sideways to higher signaling that additional weakness is
still possible.

The September Canadian Dollar gapped up and traded higher overnight
as it extended this week's gains. Closes above Wednesday's high
crossing at .6558 would confirm Wednesday's trading range breakout
and confirm the resumption of this spring's rally. If September's
rally continues, the 62% retracement level of this year's decline
crossing at .6573 is September's next upside target. Momentum
indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices
during the first half of June are possible.

The September Japanese Yen was higher overnight due to light short
covering. This week's decline, which filled the gap at .8425 thereby
increasing the odds that a short-term top has been posted.
Stochastics and RSI are turning bearish following a test of their
respective overbought zones warning trader's to use caution as
additional weakness is possible.

PRECIOUS METALS

August comex gold was lower in overnight trading as it continues to
consolidate around the 75% retracement level of the decline off May's
high, which crosses at 267.20. Closes above 269.60 are needed to
temper the near-term bearish outlook in August gold. If the decline
resumes, the reaction low crossing at 263.20 is August's next target.
Stochastics and RSI are bearish but becoming oversold warning bears
not to press their hand as a low may be near.

July silver was lower overnight and remains poised to test trading
range support crossing at 4.31 in the near future. Closes below this
support level crossing at 4.31 would open the door for a possible
test of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term
is possible.

July copper was lower overnight due to spillover selling following
Wednesday's downside reversal. A lower close during the day session
would increase the odds that this week's bounce has come to an end.
Closes below Monday's low would open the door for additional weakness
and could lead to a test of weekly support crossing at 74.10 later
this spring. It will take closes above 77.20 to temper the near-term
bearish outlook in the market. Momentum indicators are neutral to
bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices into early-June
appears are still possible.

GRAINS

July corn was higher overnight due to hot/dry conditions in eastern
China's key crop producing region are gaining increased attention
from the market. Yield reductions of some crops have already taking
place. Rain is needed soon over the dry areas to avoid additional
crop losses. Producers in the US remained concern over the cool/wet
conditions across the Midwest, which have slowed early development of
this year's corn crop. However, traders have indicated that these
conditions are of little concern at this point in the growing season.
This morning's export sales report will provide near-term direction
for the market. Pre-report estimates range from 850,000 to 1 million
metric tonnes. Wednesday's upside reversal hinted that the pause
above broken trendline resistance might be coming to an end. A higher
close on Thursday would set the stage for a possible of May's high
crossing at 2.11 1/2 later this month. Early calls are for July corn
to open 1 to 1 1/4 cents higher this morning.

July wheat was higher in overnight trading due to hot/dry conditions
across China, which has lead to some yield reduction of their hard
red winter wheat crop. Overnight gains were limited as the wheat
harvest has moved into southern Oklahoma and is accelerating. Early
yield results are fair however, protein levels are coming in better
than expected. The trade will be closely watching this morning's
export sales report for near-term direction. Pre-report estimates
range from 300,000 to 500,000 metric tonnes. Early calls are for July
wheat to open steady to 1 cent higher this morning.

SOYBEAN COMPEX

July soybeans were steady in overnight trading following Wednesday's
close into new highs for the month. Extended weather forecasts are
calling for warmer temps however, additional rain is also in the
forecast, which will continue to delay the last of this year's
soybean crop to be planted. Traders will also be watching this
morning's export sales report for near-term direction. Pre-report
estimates range from 200,000 to 400,000 metric tonnes. Export sales
continue to run at or just above the pace needed to reach the latest
USDA projection. Some traders believe that the USDA will actually
raise their export projection of soybeans for this year in the
upcoming June supply/demand report. Wednesday's new high close for
the month keeps the uptrend off April's low intact with March's high
at 4.77 1/2 marking a potential target later this year. Momentum
indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are
possible. Early calls for July soybeans to open steady this morning.

July soybean meal was higher overnight as it is challenging the 62%
retracement level of this winter's decline crossing at 169.40.
Multiple closes above this resistance level could lead to an eventual
test of the 75% retracement level crossing at 175.40 later this
month. Traders will be closely watching this morning's export sales
report for confirmation that foreign demand remains strong.
Pre-report estimates range from 100,000 to 175,000 metric tonnes.
Momentum indicators have renewed their bullish modes signaling that
sideways to higher prices near-term are possible. Early calls are for
July soybean meal to open 10 to 30-cents higher this morning.

LIVESTOCK

August hogs closed unchanged as a short covering bounce ahead of the
close erased early losses. If the rally resumes, April's high
crossing at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below last week's
gap at 64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top has been
posted. Momentum indicators remain bullish but are entering their
respective overbought zones warning bulls to use caution as a
short-term top might be near.

August cattle closed lower on Wednesday and in doing so turned a
number of momentum indicators bearish from overbought levels
signaling that a broad double top with January's high might be in
place. Today's sell off was triggered by a growing sentiment that a
seasonal break is underway. Talk of sagging boxed beef and cash
markets also weighed on prices. Some traders suggested that packers
would either have to cut kills or hold off buying large numbers of
cattle in the cash market to make up for recent profit margin
reductions.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee closed lower on Wednesday due in large part
to a lack of short covering buying and forecasts calling for mild
weather in Brazil's coffee growing region this weekend. Momentum
indicators are oversold hinting that a short-term low is in place or
near. Closes above 60.80 are needed to temper the near-term bearish
outlook in the market.

July cocoa posted a quiet inside day with a lower close as it
consolidated some of this week's short covering gains. July remains
below broken trading range support crossing at 955 leaving the door
open for sideways to lower trading if Monday's low is exceeded.
However, momentum indicators are becoming oversold warning bears to
use caution when pressing the short side of the market.

July sugar posted a key reversal down on Wednesday hinting that the
short covering bounce off last week's double bottom might have come
to an end. Additional weakness on Thursday is needed to confirm
today's bearish reversal pattern. Momentum indicators are bearish
signaling that a resumption of May's decline is possible. If the
decline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.

July cotton closed higher on Wednesday keeping the short covering
bounce off last week's low alive for the time being. However, July
needs to close above this year's downtrend line crossing near 43.95
to confirm that a bottom and trend change has taken place. Momentum
indicators are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices near-term are possible.

Click here for this morning's Watch List Stocks: http://www.realtimetraders.com/marketinfo/watchlist.asp Beyond The Numbers
Markets pulls back on more negative news
Wednesday we talked about the possibility of market getting ahead of 
itself on too much optimism. Just one day after the triple digit gain, Dow 
gave back virtually all its gains thanks to Hewlett Packard and JP Morgan. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. warned trading revenues will probably decline 
in the quarters ahead and the company will have to realize some write 
downs relating to venture capital funds. Hewlett Packard warned the  
slowdown in IT spending has spread globally to other economies around 
the world, especially Asia and Europe. Wednesday RealTimeTraders 
speculated that Asia and Europe might be the next in line to feel the 
effects of the technology slowdown. If these two regions do indeed start 
to show signs of weakness, it may become a major problem to some of  
the US Corporations. 
We believe Thursday everyone will closely watch Intel Corp's comments 
to determine if a turn around is in sight. Given HP's comments, the analyst 
community will pay close attention to comments from Intel and other multi-
national corporations for any signs of a global slowdown. Hewlett Packard 
finished the session lower by $1.34 to close at $28.71 on 9.3 million shares. 
Dow finished the session lower by 105 points, Nasdaq finished the session 
lower by 17 points and the S&P finished the session lower by 13 1/2 points. 
Markets may continue to come under pressure on Thursday as a result of 
the slew of negative news that was announced after the close on Wednesday. 
As described below Wells Fargo announced a huge charge as a result of bad 
venture capital deals. Brocade Communications (BRCD) warned earnings 
would be below previously expected. American Eagle (AEOS) reported may 
same store sales that were significantly below street estimates. And a 
California court handed a verdict against Philip Morris (MO) worth more 
than $3 billion. 
Stocks to watch
INTC - Shares of Intel Corp. have been trading in a very narrow range over 
the past few weeks as investors await to see what the company will say in 
the mid quarter update on Thursday. It seems Advanced Micro Devices  
(AMD) has been winning the war on price, and this morning CS First Boston 
echoed the same concerns and said it expects Intel to lower EPS estimates 
tomorrow.
WFC - After the close Wells Fargo reported it will recognize an after tax non-
cash charge of approximately $1.13 billion in the second quarter related to 
impairment of some of its venture capital securities. The company said the 
bulk of the charge, which equates to $0.65 per share, comes from reductions 
of non-cash venture capital recognized in late 1999 and 2000. On this news 
the stocks traded lower by 3% in after hours.
Sector Analysis
Small Stocks continues to do well
In the past few weeks some of the small stocks have been powering higher in 
anticipation of improving economic conditions. Readers may want to take note 
the small stock index Russell has gained almost 20% in the last 2 months. 
However, note the index does have some resistance around the 517 level. 
Wednesday the Russell 2000 lost 3.90 points and closed at 512. If technology 
stocks pick up momentum, this index may see further upside. Those who like 
to follow small stocks may want to visit our ""$5 and under"" page.
Economic Reports & Bond Markets
Thursday weekly jobless claims will be released at 8:30 AM, current 
consensus estimate is 417K. Then wholesale Inventory data for the month 
of April is expected at 10 AM. Friday there are no economic reports to be 
released. Therefore, bond market activity will most likely depend on 
technical indicators. Wednesday the September contracts finished the 
session higher by 1 tick to close at 101.01.
Market Breadth 
Wednesday's NYSE advance/decline reading was 1215/1856 Vs. 
Tuesday's reading of1986/1087
Wednesday's Nasdaq advance/decline reading was 1619/2201 Vs.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

COMMENT: In 1984, I coined the term ""Bond Vigilantes"" to describe the
growing power of fixed income investors and traders over the economy. In
recent years, they've lost some of their clout because the U.S. Treasury is
paying off the federal debt. Also, inflation has been relatively tame, and
so have they. Venture capitalists became the new power elite in the late
1990s leading the Nasdaq to record highs. Now the bond crowd is back: They
are tightening credit conditions, while the Fed is easing. The Treasury bond
yield is up over 50 basis points since March, which is boosting mortgage
rates. The spread between A-rated corporate and 10-year Treasury yields has
widened dramatically from around 150 basis points at the end of 1999 to more
than 250 basis points recently. The high-yield and commercial paper markets
are essentially shutdown for all but prime borrowers.

On the other hand, the yield curve is ascending again with the 30-year yield
more than 200 basis points above the 3-month T-bill rate. At the start of
the year, the curve was inverted with a spread of 50 basis points. This is
good news because an ascending yield curve gives banks and other financial
intermediaries an incentive to lend. The banks also have lots of money to
lend because shell-shocked stock investors are putting more of their funds
into bank deposits, which are up $350 billion over the past 12 months.

The resulting rapid rise in the monetary aggregates is Exhibit A in the case
against both a recession and a prolonged bear market in stocks. Indeed, real
GDP was up 2% during the first quarter and stock prices have rebounded
nicely since early April. Still, the rolling recession is likely to continue
rolling over the technology industry, and shows more signs of spreading to
labor markets around the country. Furthermore, the stock market is now more
than 15% overvalued as stock prices rose at the same time that earnings
expectations fell and bond yields moved higher.

SUBSCRIBERS: I can only conclude that either bond investors need Prozac, or
stock investors are back on Ecstasy. For more on this subject, see my latest
GLOBAL PORTFOLIO STRATEGY and tune into my Monday WEEKLY AUDIO FORUM. In my
latest commentary, I also lower my outlook for 2001 S&P 500 operating
earnings per share from $53 to $50. The profits recession is getting worse.
In the latest EARNINGS WEEK, Joe Abbott and I observe that already 132
companies have publicly released downward guidance for the second quarter!
We also slice and dice the Energy sector, which remains one of our
""overweight"" recommendations.

PUBLIC: Our ONLINE CHART ROOMS are packed with Slide Shows of credit and
yield curve spreads. Did you know that Xerox is the best performing
component of the S&P 100 so far this year, followed by Microsoft? We've
added more Daily Stock Trackers to help you keep track. Check out the
important results of April's CIO Magazine Tech Survey (in partnership with

997,"Hey,

It has been awfully busy now that I'm managing both Gas Daily and 
Mid-continent Basis.  Luckily, the market has settled down and given me a 
chance to get up to speed.

Needless to say, I haven't been to any happy hours either.  I did get to go 
to an Astros game with Natsource a few weeks ago, however.  If I hear of 
anything I will let you know.

Anyway, looks like it's about quitting time.  


- Andy

P.S.  Feel free to call me direct anytime for quotes.",Natsource,,Gas Daily Astros

Mery,

I have attached the transportation scenario with some prices added.  

Unfortunately, I will not be available at 4:00 PM today.  Please call me tomorrow in order to reschedule.

1001,"Group,
A quick reminder.  When doing a buy/resale where we are purchasing from a 
counterparty, please make the buy price the price you pay the counterparty 
and the sell price the price the counterparty pays you.  So for a $5 
buy/resale at 130/135 the legs would be a buy at $135, and a sell at $130.  
In scheduling you will see a positive price of $5.  A negative price in 
scheduling represents US getting paid.  If you have questions please ask.

Thanks,
Bill Williams",Bill Williams,5 135 130,130/135

1049,"In the last week, five new ideas have been posted to the Idea Vault and 
routed for review, including Enron Airline Services, the Enron Office Locator 
and the use of geostationary satellites to read meters.  
We also have a success story to share.  Tony Pickett suggested that Enron 
compile a glossary of terms (abbreviations, acronyms and industry jargon) and 
make it available online.  The New Hire Network has stepped up to make this 
idea a reality.
Visit the ThinkBank today and drop an idea in the Idea Vault!


This week, we are releasing a new version of eSpeak!  From the audience 
perspective, the changes are very subtle.  We've added features such as a 
time stamp on each posting, the ability to format responses, and we've even 
put the speaker's photo inside the transcript window (in case you forget 
who's hosting the event).  From eSpeak's perspective, we've smoothed out some 
things  behind the scenes.  We hope you'll take a look at the new site and 
let us know what you think about it.  
The next eSpeak will take place on Thursday, Mar. 29 at 10 a.m. Houston 
time.  Mark Koenig, executive VP of Investor Relations, will discuss Enron's 
investor relations function and provide a stock update.

 

Hey, check out this cool, stainless steel mug!	It's almost as cool as this mouse 
pad!

	
	

Both the mug and the mouse pad are available at the Signature Shop online, 
with lots of other really neat eThink stuff.  Buy some today!

Just a quick reminder.  We have a meeting April 11 at 4:30 in the afternoon.  
We will review ytd performance of the group, areas where we are doing well, 
and areas for improviement.  Please bring your thoughts and material to take 
notes.  We will also have a couple Hot Lips Pizzas again. 
 
Additionally, I have not heard from all of you regarding the class on April 
27th and 28th. 
The course is Electric System Operation for the Non-engineer.  The course 
highlights include:
Generation
Transmission and Overhead
Distribution Systems
Underground Distribution
Switchgear
Voltage Control
Matching Generation

The course will purportedly provide a comprehensive understanding of system 
operations including fossil fuel, hydro and nuclear generation, transmission 
and distribution.  The course should provide not only technical information 
but also economics of operation, system and equipment protection and safety.

If I have not heard from you by Noon on the 11th, I will assume that you are 
not interested.
Thanks,

1078,"ENRON MS WALK =01) RAIN OR SHINE
Saturday, April 21
Walk Begins 9:00 am sharp
World Trade Center=20
121 SW Salmon
Portland, Oregon


CONGRATULATIONS!  Your commitment to join TEAM ENRON has helped our TEAM be=
=20
the LARGEST MS team in the state of Oregon.  This is a great achievement an=
d=20
one that we can all be proud of.  Your commitment to this Walk and the=20
pledges you raise will help to find the cause and cure for multiple scleros=
is.

At the time of this email notice, approximately 150 TEAM ENRON walkers have=
=20
registered.  The following Q&A will provide instructions/directions in orde=
r=20
for us to have a successful Walk this Saturday!

Where is the Enron MS Walk held this year?
This year=01,s Walk begins and ends at 1st & Salmon Street, near the Salmon=
=20
Street Springs =01) in Waterfront Park.  Registration will be  directly acr=
oss=20
the street at Two World Trade Center (middle building of PGE=01,s offices a=
t 2nd=20
& Salmon).

What time does the Walk begin and how far is it?
The Walk begins at 9:00 am =01) rain or shine!  You can elect to walk in th=
e 5K=20
or 10K =01) no decision or commitment needs to be made; just decide the day=
 of=20
the event.  It is recommended, due to parking constraints, that all Walkers=
=20
arrive downtown by 8:00 am, in order to complete required tasks before the=
=20
Walk. =20

Can I bring my dog with me?
You sure can!  All TEAM ENRON dogs are welcome to walk with their owners fo=
r=20
this great cause.  All dogs should have leashes.  Just be sure to bring alo=
ng=20
your own pooper-scoopers for this purpose.=20

Where do I meet up with TEAM ENRON?
TEAM ENRON walkers will meet around 8:30 am near Salmon Street Springs =01)=
 look=20
for the TEAM ENRON sign.  There will be lots of activity and people in this=
=20
area, so plan ahead to meet up with your fellow TEAM ENRON walkers no later=
=20
than 8:45 am. =20

I haven=01,t received my TEAM ENRON t-shirt =01) what do I do?
Because of the number of TEAM ENRON registrants and the various locations o=
f=20
our TEAM walkers, it may not be possible to deliver t-shirts to each walker=
. =20
Therefore, if you HAVE NOT received your TEAM ENRON t-shirt by the end of t=
he=20
work day on Friday, April 20, please plan on picking up your t-shirt betwee=
n=20
8:00-8:30 am on Walk Day.  Pick-up location will be at One World Trade Cent=
er=20
on the Bridge Level (at the top of the escalators).  T-shirts will be=20
distributed at this location from 8:00-8:30 am  ONLY..

Am I suppose to wear my TEAM ENRON t-shirt at the Walk?
Yes, yes, yes!  As the title sponsor of this year=01,s Walk for the state o=
f=20
Oregon, we want to show off our name and support for this great cause! =20

What if I have NOT turned in my pledge form to a Team Captain before the Wa=
lk?
No problem.  We encourage you to turn in your pledges at the MS registratio=
n=20
tables at Two World Trade Center prior to the Walk that morning.  Most of y=
ou=20
have received the yellow notice and white envelope in the mail from the MS=
=20
Society.  This envelope is to be used to put your pledge form and collected=
=20
dollars/checks in.  If you did NOT receive the yellow notice and white=20
envelope in the mail from the MS Society, they will provide an envelope for=
=20
this purpose at the MS Registration table.=20

Upon turning in your pledge form at the Registration table, you will receiv=
e=20
an MS walk t-shirt.  (For those that have already turned in their pledges=
=20
prior to Saturday, the MS Walk t-shirt will be delivered or sent to you.)

I thought I was pre-registered and the pledges would be picked up prior to=
=20
the Walk.
Again, because of the various locations for our Walkers, it may not be=20
possible to pick up all pledges.   If your pledge form is NOT picked up pri=
or=20
to the end of the work day this Friday, you will need to do the following:
1) Pick up your TEAM ENRON t-shirt (instructions above)
2) Go to MS Registration Table to turn in your pledge form
3) Pick up your MS Walk t-shirt at the same time you turn in your pledge=20
form. (You will only receive your MS Walk t-shirt once your pledge forms ha=
ve=20
been turned in.)

I have a friend that wants to walk but isn=01,t registered, can they regist=
er=20
the day of event?
Absolutely.  Send that friend to the =01&Walk On=01,s=018 table in the Regi=
stration=20
area.  Be sure to have them sign on as TEAM ENRON walker!

Do I need to bring anything else with me for this Walk?
If you plan on carrying anything with you, ie,identification, wallet, MS wa=
lk=20
t-shirt, water, umbrella, camera, munchies, etc., you may want to carry a=
=20
backpack. =20


Does Enron match employee contributions?
Enron will match Enron Broadband Services and Enron North America employee=
=20
contributions.  If you have not completed a matching form, please contact=
=20
your team captain.  These employee contributions are matched 100% and adds =
up=20
easily.

Is this tax-deductible and how are receipts given?
You bet it is tax-deductible.  If a pledge is $75 or greater, a=20
tax-deductible receipt will be sent directly from the MS Society.  However,=
=20
if the pledge is less than $75 and a receipt is requested, a receipt needs =

1113,"I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all 
organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <
http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view 
these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at 
(713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at 
(713) 853-7127

1130,"Group,

For the third day in a row (4th time this week) I have received an email or 
call from Kathy at EPE asking the model to be resent because of simple 
errors.  Typos in the model should be caught and corrected while checking out 
with counterparties and running the CARP.  The ancillary service (spin) deals 
need to sum into the ancillary section at the bottom...not with the regular 
deal entry summary.  We need to use the reconciliation sheet when appropriate 
(which has not been used since Feb--and this will haunt us when Houston tries 
to check out March and April).  We do a good job trading for EPE and managing 
their system but I am not impressed with our attention to detail for this 
customer on deal entry.  I continue to see the same mistakes which suggests 
that procedure questions exist.  Please ask myself or a senior member of the 
group if you have any questions.  I look for us to improve going forward.

Thanks,

Bill

In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the wa=

Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders?

non-purchase orders.

Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders?
No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you=

What if I do not know my EID?
All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and=

to Houston, have about a four hour session (2 hours each) with ABB, and GE in 
ENA's offices with Peter Thompson, Lisa Bills et al to get the B/O contracts 
done.

Peter is in favor, and I certainly think its time to stop e mailing back and 
fourth - just sit down and dedicate the time to get all comments resolved.",Dale - I Peter Thompson Lisa Bills et al Peter,,ABB GE ENA
1210,"As soon as I hit the ""send"" button I recalled another issue.  Enron does not 
want the LLC used for anything other than the 
acquistion/disposition/adminstration of the equipment.  Other development 
activities should be conducted in another entity, at least so long as Enron 
has an ownership interest.  I'm going to double check this, as it seems the 
LOI is fairly specific on this point.

1. I don't think you need to do anything re Enron South America, as Rob 
Taylor is working on that.  Were you asking about ENA? Delaware, 1400 Smith, 
Houston, 77002.
 2.  I don't know who is preparing all the exhibits, as I'm waiting to hear 
from GE.  Don't most of the exhibits just need to be copied?  Is the list you 
gave me of the exhibits which need to be adapted the right place to look?
3. No.  The November payment has been made.  

You should get the other info by email from Eric Boyt.

Thanks,

Kay

1218,"I understand completely.  Those ear infections can be very painful.  Nothing 
can get to you like your kid in pain.  If it makes you feel any better I have 
a 20year old (I can't believe it) and a 6 year old (even more unbelievable), 
and both have a lot of allergies and sinus infections, etc.  My oldest  also 
had a lot of ear infections, and it seemed to be painful.  But she out grew 
the problem.

I expect to be in town Mon-Thurs, with high hopes of taking Friday off to 
join my husband at his officer's meeting in San Antonio.

has some questions about this agreement, so she asked me to forward the doc.  
This is a doc for a 40 yr ground lease for a power plant.  It is my

After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our ""Ode to Why"" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the ""Leading Company in the World.""

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.",Frank Gehry,,"Enron CRM Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition Gehry the ""Leading Company"

1235,"Dear Mr McConnell

Thank you for your e-mail. To reply to your queries:
Meier Graefe was the name of the man who directed the print publishing
business of Pan in the 1890's. 'Pan' was the name under which the business
issued a literary and arts magazine in Berlin, but with a special focus on
French art. Pan issued sets of lithographs and etchings, mostly specially
commissioned from the artists and drawn especially for Pan, as in the case
of the Cross and Signac, to accompany the the text of the magazine. These
prints are referred to as the Pan 'album'.

The Signac is from the regular edition of the Pan album, and as such is not
numbered. Only the de-luxe edition was numbered (see Cross). Neither Signac
nor Cross are signed in the stone. Both are very well known and fully
documented works by the artists.

I will look forward to hearing further from you.

Some two weeks ago we sent you the colour illustrations of the works by
Signac and Cross which you had said were of interest to you. Since that
time we have had no reply fromyou.

Did you receive the package? Perhaps you could let us know the situation.

1237,"Dear Mr McConnell

Thank you for your e-mail of the 20th October. I apologise for the slow
reply but I was travelling when it was received at the gallery.

I now have 'pointillist' colour works by Cross and Signac which might be of
interest to you. Both are from the collection of one of my clients.

The Signac is similar to the work that you liked on the website. The
details are:

volant paper. Full margins. Image: 8 x 10 3/8ins. o2500 (US$ 3750)

There is no illustration of the Cross on the website. If you do not know
the image then we could arrange for a printout in colours to be sent to you
by Fedex (we do not currently have scan available for e-mail) but we would
need your full mailing address.

The details are as follows:

we do know how difficult it is to make it over.  I did hear your California

Habitat for Humanity Project 





Welcome Habitat Volunteers! 

Our project starts on October 20, at 8 am.  Due to the overwhelming response from our church community, it will be necessary to schedule volunteers for particular Saturdays from October 20 through November 17. We want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to participate without overcrowding the building site.  If I have scheduled you for a date you are unavailable, please let me know; there are plenty of people to step in!  The schedule for October 20 is attached.  Others will follow shortly. 

Please plan on providing your own lunch on October 20.  We will provide drinks, but you should bring water for yourself. 

I have ordered tee shirts. If you want one, please advise me of your size, small through extra large, in writing or e-mail.  The price is $8.00, which will just cover our cost.  The shirts are gray with the Habitat bent nail logo on the back and the St. Paul's logo on the front.  I will have them at the site. 

We will have hard hats at the site.  If you are scheduled to work and have indicated that you have power tools, please confirm to me that you will be able to bring those tools on your scheduled days.

Hello, I'm back this morning from overseas.  I am assuming that you got what 
you needed but in case you are still waiting on a response, I like the 
article.  If you still have time or want any additional comments.  I would 
simply add a couple of products to the list of Enron Global Markets.  The 
group is also responsible for Global Risk Management (insurance products), 
LNG trading, agriculture trading, and Interest rate trading.  I just don't 
want to leave any groups out of the article if possible.  Thanks and good 
luck and i certainly understand if I'm too late.

In regard to the Reports screen in ERMS launched from runm, where ERMS reports like the TopPage, Forwards and Options Detail are printed from, could you please provide us a list of reports that you also print to ""FILE"", that is, instead of printing the report to a printer, you print the report to a file.

Please forward this to anyone in your group who is also using ERMS Reports.

Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.

It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chance to say goodbye.  

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!

1288,"John, I plan to speak with Sequent by the end of this week to inform them if we are interested in returning the assets to them and if so under what structure.  I have checked with Cris Sherman and others in Accounting, they have determined that the ""East Desk"" does not have to accelerate the payment of its ""debt"" to John Arnold's book if we get out of the Hopewell transaction. That being said, you were checking on the real $$$ exposure to retaining the Hopewell deal past the VNG transaction.  The way we are currently booked we are not interested in restructuring the VNG/Hopwell arrangement. If on the other hand we see real $$$ exposure, this is the perfect time to try to combine the VNG restructuring with the Hopwell exposure.  I need to understand our position this week if possible.

FYI.  Gerald & I met with Ed Wick at Chevron today and went through the 
logistics of the deal.  I believe we had a meeting of the minds & he has 
agreed to use our form with some changes that we are fine with.  We have 
promised to get him a copy of the new compression deal by early next week.  
There are a few changes that Wick desires that are a business decision that 
we need confirmation on.  He wants to:
 (1) Change the term from 3 years+evergreen to 2 years+evergreen?
 (2) Is a MDQ of 500 MCF/Day acceptable?  ( He stated that we are currently 
flowing 50 MCF/day)
 
I have made the requested changes to the attached document.  Please review 
and forward me your comments as well as confirmation on the 2 questions 
above.  That is of course once you return from Boston.............

I had an error in the Adjusted Purchase price calc.  Instead of $4,000,705, it should be $4,705,000.  Thus, the adjusted purchase price should be $209,863,642.  The error correction is in ENA's favor.
With that change, NBP is good with the document.

a.m. in Baton Rouge.  I will forward a copy of the public notice upon
receipt.  The purpose of the public hearing is to allow any interested
parties to make comments or present evidence on the application.  Joe
Ball prefers that Bridgeline not present any evidence or testimony at
the hearing.  Joe considers the application to be evidence of everything
needed to approve the permit.  Accordingly, I do not intend to present
any evidence at the hearing.  Our role will be to observe any comments
or protests by interested parties.  Joe Ball will advise if there are
any issues raised at the hearing that require a response and we can
supplement the record in writing.  This approach is preferable because
it does not subject anyone involved with the project to
cross-examination at the hearing and it affords us time to make an
informed and calculated response (if needed).

David and Robert: considering the importance of this project to your
respective companies, I would encourage you both to attend if possible.
I will defer to David as to whether Harry Allison should attend.

1) Scope of Agreement: ..""judgement resulting from this Agreement shall be made only from the revenues received from Customer's natural gas system operations..""  I need to re-review the financials to determine how much the gas system operations is worth.  Because of this clause, $15mm in credit may be too much.  Once I can get on the net, I'll review.
 
2) Scope of Agreement:  ""Furthermore, in accordance with the Colorado Springs City Charter, performance of Customer's obligations.....expressly subject to appropriation of funds for such purpose by the City Council.""  In case we are in a position to call for margin, what is the process of getting it?  Do they have to get permission / authorization from the city, etc..? Tyrell had asked me the process how we call and what we accept for margin, but I'd like to understand the ease and/or difficulty of receiving margin from them.  We may never hit the threshold, but if we do and we can't get margin, we may have a big problem.

Each of these releases would be done with the following terms:

1.  First bidder meeting minimum terms
2.  Permanent release
3.  Hide the minimum rate
4.  The release will be at the contract rate
5.  The release will be recallable
6.  ENA will then follow up with a notice to WIC that we are giving up our 
recall rights at a later date

Please let me know if this looks ok to you and let me know if each of these 
parties are authorized to do capacity releases with WIC.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",Jeff McMahon Jeff Andy Fastow,,Enron Enron Industrial Markets Enron Corp.   Enron Net Works CFO

1374,"Here's a mental picture for you of me when I got to the chafing part of your 
email...thumbs in ears, remaining fingers covering eyes, and repetitive 
chanting of la,la,la,la,la,la........  

I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the ""fun run"" on 
Thanksgiving.  I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were 
here right now.  You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate 
how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!  He just asked someone how 
Chi-COG-OOOO was.  How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out 
the last)???  Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that 
he does.  I'll update you as he provides me with more stories.

As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here.  
I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.  They 
have a lot of American fast food chains.  The one that surprised me though 
was KFC...it's everywhere.  It's a lot more popular there than it is here.  I 
guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a 
vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of 
lamb.  Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.  And they eat 
meat pies....yuck.  The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to 
the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.  I think they still have a little 
too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in 
seasoning.  

I saw quite a few good looking guys.  There was a lifesaver training course 
going on at Bondi while I was there.  That provided some great scenery!!  But 
then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the 
speedos!!  The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be 
worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear 
under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the 
beach!!!!  I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure 
he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might 
see and for fear he'd think I was interested.

Gotta go to a meeting.

1398,"Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to  Columbia Energy Services 
for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.  I downloaded this directly from Michcon's 
system  and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in 
the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.  It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and 
what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the 
difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.   

We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates 
of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make 
sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to 
CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:

   Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference
3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177)
3/3/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/4/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/5/00   11,417    11,417   0

3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0


I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go 
back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is 
imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to 
the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the 
gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is 
out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the 
scheduler would help tremendously.  

Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at 
acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that 
a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On 
the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to 
CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day 
with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required 
Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our 
suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to 
look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be 
delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points 
for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT 
customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other 
non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have 
made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we 
could.

     The Bentley Arnage Red Label is a beautiful four door sedan, but it's not for everyone.
http://www.bentleymotors.co.uk/bentley/picture_gallery/bentley_2.jpg
True though it may be that when ordering the Arnage one gets to specify burr walnut, burr oak, bird's eye maple or black lacquer veneer, most would still find the $200K+ sticker price out of reach. Even most of those in a position to do the deal would walk away in the face of a dubious value proposition. After all, burr oak veneer is still veneer.


WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LEGAL RESEARCH?

     Lawyers from coast-to-coast complain that computer based legal research costs continue to spin out of control. Many, given their firm size, practice area or jurisdiction, simply can no longer justify these onerous annual contracts with West or Lexis. Others have concluded, as one guesses they might with the Bentley, that after peeling back the veneer, these highfalutin compusearchers simply cost more than they are worth.


THEORY vs. REALITY

     As nice as it might be to own a Bentley, it would have been nicer still had they simply provided you with a shiny new Arnage for free while you were in law school, just as our competitors regularly hook law students with free unlimited access, only to yank the needle upon graduation.

     What percentage of attorneys in the real world enjoy unlimited access to WestLaw? Perhaps more to the point, what percentage enjoy unlimited access to those WestLaw resources that their practice truly demands? Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues?

     --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?

     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?

     --How do you respond to a legal research industry that likes to market primary jurisdiction packages and thumbs its nose at the reality that you practice in a state like Vermont, for example, a jurisdiction that only issues about 100 new published opinions ANNUALLY, and not surprisingly has yet to consider anything remotely resembling your client's situation?

     Our subscribers snicker to themselves, click a checkbox to search ALL states and they pay not one thin additional dime for the privilege. (See covered jurisdictions listed below the signature line.)


""I AM IN MY SWEATS DOING BILLABLE RESEARCH. I LOVE IT!""

WHAT ABOUT WEST AND LEXIS?

     Pay them only when you have to. Will you still use Lexis or West from time to time? Sure. Probably. But perhaps you will get to the point where you use them on the web with your credit card, when you can't otherwise get the answer faster, cheaper elsewhere. Or maybe you like that West or Lexis Primary Jurisdiction Plan that you've been using all these years and you think TheLaw.net can provide a sort of meter insurance for those occasions where the circumstances call for a national look.

We believe we now have ""execution ready"" schedules.  If you would like to 
review your relevant section once more, please contact Stuart Zisman.  
Otherwise we will assume no request for review is an acknowledgement that the 
schedules are complete and include everything that you feel is relevant.  As

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.

Updated: Monday, December 3, 2001 06:52 PM ET 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. is negotiating with three financial institutions of ""impeccable creditworthiness"" regarding a joint venture aimed at restarting its trading operation, said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer for the company. 
Enron expects to announce its joint venture partner within weeks, according to Bienenstock. 
The joint venture would use that institution's financial means to guarantee that Enron would pay its bills. 
Also Monday, at a court hearing Enron announced $1.5 billion in debtor in possession financing from a syndicate led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
The company said that it needs about $250 million for immediate operating needs. Currently, Enron has about $500 million in cash.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals
The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new ""Morning Briefing"" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.  In addition to market moving news items, the report contains key market data such as prices, MMBtu curves, refinery outages, open interest analysis and various other market driving information.  The report is updated by 7.30 a.m. each day and can be found on the Crude and Products Fundamentals intranet at <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/> under In House Analysis, Morning Briefing.

may  be no way to remove based upon diversity unless we can show a sham

served, factor in remand.
Election of Judges:
 We are still determining election cycle for Judge Meyer and Judge

 According to one counsel that we interviewed, he believes that Judge
Meyer is a ""dim bulb on the  chandelier"" and Judge Amos is worse.

As a result of Ms. Ballard's asking these questions, the other defendants

meetings with other plaintiffs' counsel, which brought out the meeting with
Kathy.  The defendants established that Mike and Kathy both took notes during
their meetings; and defendants have now demanded those notes.

It seems the fates were against us meeting up! you were in Singapore while I 
was in Houston. I really do hope we get to meet up sooner rather than later.

I did get the chance to meet with Stuart and had what I thought was a very 
fruitful discussion on, among other tings, MT Pacific Valour. I hope you have 
both had the chance to speak about it since. I understand Richard has been 
trying to catch you to discuss the matter as well, but both your busy 
schedules have prevented it.

Richard and I would very much like to get your take on the situation at 
present. Whilst it is clear that if a commercial solution is met with Hyundai 
we would not be able to claim against our contracting counterparty under the 
C/P, I understand from Stuart that a commercial solution may not be in the 
offing. If so, our option would be to commence arbitration against the 
contracting counterparty under the C/P .Present information indicate the 
contracting counterparty to be MTM Shipmanagement which has substantial 
assets sufficient to meet our claim (which is relatively small although not 
insignificant). Arresting the vessel would therefore not be necessary since 
it is simply a tool to obtain security for the claim.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Three little boys were concerned because they couldn't get anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they had not been baptized and didn't go to Sunday school. So they went to the nearest church, but only the janitor was there.  
One said, ""We need to be baptized because no one will come out and play with us. Will you baptize us?""  
""Sure,"" said the janitor.

Hi everyone,

Well I have volunteered to schedule all the volunteers for the NIT
tournament. I drafted Ashley Wagner to help with this task.  I need all the
School Commissioners to contact your coaches and ask them to email me their
3 volunteers asap.  If they do not have email access would you please get
the names and email them to me? Those of you who have the names and have
just been waiting to find out what to do with them, now can unload them on
me.

Ashley Wagner and myself will start calling them (so please include a phone
number!) to see when they would like to work.  The first names we get will
be the first we call so they will get the best choice of fields and times.
So do them a favor and get them in soon!!!

1467,"We just got some more information in the mail yesterday on the College
Savings Plan.  We will study it some more, and let you know how good or bad
it sounds.  Some good may be that YOU could deduct the amount you give on
YOUR income tax (there doesn't seem to be a cap on deducting the amount you
give if you make big bucks).  The initial bad I see is the $24/year fee plus
.6% of earnings.  Anyway, we will look it over in more detail.  They do not
restrict you to only go to Nebraska colleges, and you do not have to be a
Nebraska resident to open up an account.   Josh and Jarrod could each have
an account, with annual contributions up to $165,000 (tax deferred), and
when you take the money out, it is taxed at Josh and Jarrods tax rate.

Please remind me/reassure me about the Educational IRA.  It is similar to a
Roth IRA in that taxes are paid (by you in this case)on the money prior to
putting it into the account.  I don't list it anywhere on my income tax

- utter disappointment.  But yes, it is definitely his loss.  And, I loved 
the fact that Kevin (his friend) spent so much time talking to my Dad because 
that had to make Ted feel like a complete jerk (which he is).

I'm am very excited about my trip to London.  The other guy I mentioned in 
the email, Darren, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll 
get to see him there as well.  Plus, in November I'm going to visit my 
brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting.  The globe 
trotting continues.

Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.  I wish I could be 
there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Austin this 
weekend.  I've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though, so 
if some great fares come up for Houston to San Diego I can take advantage of 
them.  Talk to you soon.

1528,"FERC issued orders last night in the two New York dockets regarding extension 
of NYISO's $1,000 bid cap and extension of the ISO's TEP authority.  FERC 
grants extension of both authorities until October 31, 2001.  The ISO 
requested that both the bid cap and the TEP authority be extended for another 
18 months, but FERC found this time period to be too long, given that:  i) 
the ISO is fixing many of the problems with its markets, ii) new supply is 
being added in New York, and iii) demand response programs are being 
implemented.  

Chairman Hebert dissented from both orders, arguing that it is time for both 
measures to lapse.  Hebert is encouraged, however, by the majority's 
rejection of ISO's request to extend these measures for 18 months, and Hebert 
hopes that his colleagues will eliminate these procedures after this summer.

1531,"Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea 
(lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them 
regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:

They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power 
purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut.
McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore (""why should it be mandatory to 
go the market?""), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for 
core/noncore has a lot of merit.
Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when 
the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore) 
should pay for DWR's ""past"" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core 
customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates 
the core's ""net short"" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would 
not have to pay for any of DWR's ""going forward costs"" (since core gets them, 
in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation)
I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects 
would be and would share it with them when we're done.
While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful 
to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the 
necessary support to get passed.  They are also withholding final judgment 
until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do.
They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are 
extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge 
and Loretta Lynch.  They place very little trust in the Governor or the 
Legislature.
Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento 
for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to 
CMA.
Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to 
commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved.","Jack Steward Keith McCrea

1535,"Colleagues:

Stella Chan, Pat Keene and Harry Kingerski would like to communicate a 
streamlined process to  provide Government and Regulatory support to URM 
(Utility Risk Management).  The process strives to bring GA in the different 
regions, in Houston and URM much closer to each other to provide and 
implement GA service as completely, and cost-effectively as possible.  The 
suggested process includes four steps, namely:   
Curve validation Process, 
Quantifying of Regulatory Risks/Change, 
Coordination of Strategy Development, and 
Coordination of Strategy Implementation.  
A description of these functions are as follows:
Curve Validation Process:  This process aims at reviewing, and validating, 
every 90 days, the regulatory inputs of: a) the largest 60 curves in Enron's 
books, and b) the new deals that are under approval during the review 
period.  The curve validation process is currently in progress and  GA 
personnel in Houston and the regions are already  involved.  
Quantification of Regulatory Risks/Change:  This process aims at 
quantifying--in dollars terms--the impact of the change in the regulatory 
inputs on a specific position.  The model is now in place, and test is in 
progress.  This process will involve initiation by GA regional personnel 
(also possibly by URM) with potential regulatory changes that may impact EES 
positions.  The quantification exercise will be done jointly by URM and GA.   
Coordination of Strategy Development:  The outcome of curve validation and 
quantification of regulatory risks--functions 1, and 2 above--will likely 
call for a group of regulatory measures and action items. The function of 
Stella and Pat is to coordinate and facilitate strategy sessions in 
association with the owner of the curve in URM, and her/his counterparts in 
Midwest/Midsouth, Atlantic Seaboard, the Western Region, and Texas & Oklahoma 
Ercot, and SPP.   The strategy sessions shall come up with suggested action 
items, probability of success, and likely associate costs for 
implementation.  Stella and Pat shall be responsible for seeking the buy-off, 
and approval, of  the strategy from URM and securing the needed budget, if 
necessary.
Coordination of Strategy Implementation:  Once the strategy is approved, it 
shall enter the implementation stage.  The role of Stella and Pat is to 
coordinate between URM requests/positions and their counterparts in the 
regions.  As the case now, they shall continue supporting the regions in the 
implementation as needed.   

To facilitate these functions Stella and Pat shall emulate the coverage lines 
of the URM.  Stella shall coordinate the Eastern Region, while Pat shall 
coordinate the Western Region.  These regions do not follow the conventional 
wisdom, and need to be specifically defined.  They are:
 Eastern Region:  ME, NH, VT, NY, MA, RI, CT, NJ, PA, MD,  DE, VA, WV, NC, 
SC, GA, AL, TE, KY, and FL. 
 Western Region:  The remaining states (including OH in the east).

From the Regional perspective, the process will naturally be overseen by the 
Regional Directors  (i.e., Steve, Janine, Jean, and Paul), meanwhile, Harry 
shall oversee it from Houston side.  The process, however, is designed to 
give regional managers and GA in Houston as much autonomy as possible and 
shall make the least possible demand on the time and work load of the 
regional directors (usually in the final sprint for approvals).  

Stella, Pat, and Harry shall visit you shortly to discuss the details of the 
processes outlined above and listen to your comments and advise.   I shall 
contact you to take your suggestion for the most appropriate time for you and 
your group.

Of course, please let me know if you have any question and/or advise.

Conference committee met all thru the weekend and this afternoon recommended 
a compromise bill, SF #722.   The final bill should be voted on tonight 
before the legislature adjourns at midnight.  

We won one of two issues we were focused on.  The streamlining of 
transmission survived.  The elimination of certificate of need did not.....it 
got wrapped up in the debate over a 10% renewable portfolio mandate by 2015.  
At the end of the horsetrading, the certifcate of need fell victim to the 
enviros.  Their RPS that they thought they had locked was reduced to setting 
goals of achieving a level of 10% of Minnesota supplies as renewables and 
requiring green pricing to be instituted.  The enviros were then adamant that 
no power plants should be exempted from certificate of need. 

The third issue that we were backing is still alive--it just got transfered 
over to the tax committee.  The language to exempt new power plant personal 
property from taxes is still alive in both the House and the Senate, although 
the language in the Senate is much better. It appears that a tax bill and a 
budget bill will not be agreed to by adjournment, so government will shut 
down June 1 if action isn't taken.  Jesse will call a special session next 
week and they will pass a tax bill before the June 1 date.

Lastly,there are two other provisions that we will benefit from",Jesse,722,RPS House Senate

implementing price caps now would actually be harmful.  peaking units make no 
money.  we are likely to return to a more normal market, particularly after 
the summer, if we aren't there already.  with the forward curve crashing the

1541,"The attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the 
Commission this afternoon, in order to provide FERC staffers a concise, 
effective statement of our position while they drafted the Judge's 
recommendation.  I was able to schedule a meeting with Judge Wagner, at which 
Dan Watkiss and I stepped the Judge through the comments and hit the 
following high points: 

1.  The methodology of the June 19 order does not work and is totally 
inappropriate for marketers.  If price mitigation is inevitable, the Judge 
should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology.

2.  The Judge should recommend that the end result of any Commission order 
must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods, both prior to and 
after October 2.

3.  All buyers, including Enron, should be entitled to refunds; not just the 
State of California and its IOU's.  Enron is a net purchaser in these markets.

4.  Only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the 
methodology, not bilateral contracts, OOM sales or sales to the DWR. 

The details of these points appear in the attached document.  The Judge was 
receptive to most points.  He understood the problems that the June 19 
methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this 
should be addressed, perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form 
part of his recommendation.  He agreed that the actual buyers should receive 
refunds, and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be 
subject to the refund methodology.  Although he agreed that the refund 
methodology, once implemented, should yield just and reasonable rates, he 
felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the 
matter was up to the Commission.  The Judge spoke generally and no promises 
were made as to the content of his recommendations, but hopefully this 
insight will shed some light as to the outcome.  I urged the Judge to 
recommend placing conditions to refunds, as the Commission did in its June 19 
order with its RTO filing requirement.  The judge was noncommittal on this, 
although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset.

Next steps include filing our detailed comments by Thursday.  The Judge told 
us he would certify his recommendation to the Commission on Friday, and that 
the comments would accompany the recommendation.  Thereafter, it is likely 
that the Commission would defer to the Judge's recommendation to hold a fast 
track evidentiary hearing of 60 days duration, to determine ""unresolved 
issues of material fact"".  The scope of the hearing has not been determined, 
but  will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for 
marketers to recommend an alternative methodology.

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""twea=
ks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

1551,"Rick, Linda and I met with Dan Larcamp (Director of FERC's Office of Markets, 
Tariffs and Rates) yesterday.  He made several comments of interest:

Enron's Position on Market Structure

Dan says he's heard from the Enron traders that they like ""PJM.""  Dan would 
like us to have one of our traders come up to Washington to meet with his 
staff to talk about what attributes of PJM we really like.  For example:  

 - what brings liquidity
 - what benefits does liquidity bring -- to both Enron and utilities with end 
use customers -- how does    liquidity benefit consumers?
 - why do we support PJM over New York and New England
 - what facilitates trades, reduces transaction costs, gives the right 
signals to generators of where to site 


Gas Pipeline Issues

Dan also talked about his concerns with affiliate issues on the gas side.  He 
said INGAA has not been particularly helpful in the debate -- they disagree 
that changes are needed and do not provide much to the discussion.  Dan said 
he prefers structural changes over Code of Conduct fixes -- he doesn't want 
to have to look under rocks for violators.  He also questioned whether, if 
pipeline executives' compensation is based on the company's profits (through 
options and salary) which are derived in part from trading, whether this 
provides those executives with incentives to favor their affiliates.  

Regulatory Gap

Dan is concerned that there is a regulatory gap between FERC, the CFTC and 
the SEC.  He believes there is a large block of transactions -- primarily 
bookout transactions -- that are not being regulated by FERC or the CFTC.  We 
discussed that there is a physical component to bookouts, but he is still 
concerned that no one is overseeing these transactions.

He also compared FERC to the SEC and said they do not have the expertise or 
staff to provide market monitoring the way the SEC does.  I think FERC has 
been compared to the SEC recently and Dan's comments may have been somewhat 
defensive in response to those comparisons.

Open Access

Dan is a supporter of open access and hopes that the new Commission make up 
will lead the Commission to addressing and fixing the structural problems in 
the industry.  They have been frustrated by the amount of time and attention 
California has taken, and he is hopeful that they will be able to get 
California behind them and focus on transmission issues.  He believes FERC 
needs to have jurisdiction over native load and intimated that he would not 
be unhappy if FERC lost the Supreme Court case.

EPSA 

Dan said EPSA needs to be more focused.  We need to decide what issues are 
most important to the group and focus on those issues.  He also expressed 
concern that EPSA is always negative and does not give FERC enough credit for 
the progress it has made.  He also said EPSA needs to get the word out on the 
Hill that FERC's actions, right or wrong, are having the desired result 
(lower prices).

Overall, it was a good meeting.  Dan was happy to meet with us and said he 
and his office would like to hear from us about issues whenever we would like 
to visit with them.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments concerning the 
foregoing.

ANCILLARY SERVICES - THE NEXT FRONTIER

 Since the issuance of Order Nos. 888-889 by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (""Commission"") in 1996, market recognition of the
value of ancillary services provided in this regulatory initiative, has
increased dramatically.  Shortly thereafter, the FERC recognized that
market-based rates could also be provided for certain of these ancillary
services, which include voltage regulation, spinning reserves, non-spinning
reserves and reactive power that were critical elements of historically
bundled service.  This regulatory recognition was intended to serve as a
stimulus for market penetration and development of ancillary services in a
competitive marketplace.  With the formation of independent system operators
(ISOs) and the consideration of movement to regional transmission
organizations (RTOs), ancillary services have received increased discussion
and attention.  Frequently, markets do not have yet sufficient market makers
to create adequate transparencies in a robust competitive market for certain
services.  For example, because of market deficiencies in California and New
York, ancillary services have come under increased scrutiny.

 This short history and limited development of ancillary services is
about to change with the advent of material consideration of RTOs.  It can
be expected that a revamped Bush-era FERC will finalize most RTO proposals
this summer undertaken by former Chairman James Hoecker and his colleagues
on the Commission.  That process should conclude by the end of 2001 with
increased enforcement and market monitoring, new mechanisms to resolve
disputes, increased resolution of seams management concerns, new
transmission pricing and return policies, and major market validation of
for-profit transcos as the underlying vehicle for regional growth and
development of transmission in the future.

Key Considerations

 This market growth and recognition will not come too quickly given
the continual demise of transmission investment and development by the
regulated utility industry.  Over the past 25 years the utility industry has
whittled away its transmission legacy, with little real growth and
development of the national transmission system to support the advent and
movement to competitive markets which has accelerated since 1988.  Ancillary
services will become a critical element of that market as they become the
future call-waiting, *69, and call-forward services of the electric utility
industry - borrowing from the telephone industry parallels and paradigm from
the prior decade of experience.  Formation of RTOs will provide stronger
market validation and recognition of ancillary services.  This will
necessitate the development of separate pricing, new forms of contracting,
new revised pricing methodologies for those ancillary services through
separate contracts, and pricing opportunities through formal agreements.  In
many instances, agreements still need to be developed for ancillary service
sales or need to be materially enhanced in existing service agreements with
the electric utility.  Several areas require current consideration at this
time to ensure a smooth and effective transition:

* Interconnection agreements should fully anticipate the separate
provision of ancillary services in their technical review of a generating
facility and requirements for that facility with the electric utility.
* The interface of utility systems with control areas and RTO's need
further understanding and management for risks, liabilities and cost
consequences.
* Recognition for adequate compensation and market-based pricing for
ancillary services should be provided with the opportunity to supplement
that pricing with amended and restated schedules in relevant agreements.
* Transition of existing transmission and interconnection agreements
to the RTOs should be contemplated in current agreements.  Assignment of
those agreements should only be permitted with appropriate notice and review
rights by the generator, and the opportunity to accept, amend or reject the
terms of that assignment or transfer depending on whether it provides for
enhanced sale and market development opportunities for the market value of
ancillary services.
* There are other ancillary services yet to unfold that have not been
recognized by Order Nos. 888-889 and they should be analyzed and evaluated.
Any specificity that can be undertaken to capture recognition of those
future services, including development and pricing opportunities for those
services, should be separately retained in existing agreements now.
Otherwise, the spectre exists that those services may ultimately be provided
to the regulated utility at no charge.
Future Course of Action
Why has this occurred?  Individual utilities managing the needs of their
systems - with the public utility obligation to serve and paramount
reliability responsibilities were not willing to separately recognize the
value of ancillary services.  Bundled service also disguised this value and
did not provide an adequate and accurate platform for such recognition.
Utility divestitures of generation resources started the ball running.
Moreover, utilities operating in a monopoly, cost-of-service regime did not
have the incentive or ability to seek out new revenue streams through
creative unbundling and repackaging of ancillary services.  With the
evolution to RTOs and broader scope and markets, a shift will be undertaken
in the provision of ancillary services, such as security, emergency
planning, risk management, and reliability from discrete utility systems to
all potential players in the competitive market, including generators,
regulated utilities, transmitting utilities, power marketers and traders and
large scale industrial and commercial users.  This restructuring of the
market also provides an enhanced opportunity to assess the delivery of
critical ancillary services, their recognition as a matter of contract, and
the appropriate elements of market-based rates and cost of service analysis
(as applicable) and new methodologies justifying pricing for these new,
essential products.

 Enlightened generators and developers will be thoughtfully analyzing
this issue at this time with the goal of protecting their interests in
anticipation of the evolution of these ancillary services as part of
competitive markets, which will allow them to capture contracting and
pricing opportunities for the benefit of their owners or shareholders.

Central - Dynegy Canada sold most of the gas to us.  The desk bid was .05 over NGX.  Nicor Hub would not accept an $87 pre-pay for a wheeling fee.

West - EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal.  The desk finished short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was Opal.  Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.

AEP was noticeably absent from all regions.

1572,"?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--""contributed to Edison's undercollection"" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the ""undercollection"" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

1613,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

discussion of pit card problems and pitfalls.  Materials will focus on how=
=20
the audit trail works and successful strategies for achieving a passing=20
percentage.  Members will be required to analyze their own trading style in=

pit card performance rates.  Each plan will be discussed with the group and=
=20
members will receive feedback from Floor Committee and Compliance Review=20
Committee Members, and Compliance and Floor Department Staff.  Members=20
attending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them!

_ Upon completion of the class, members will be allowed to =01&do over=018 =
up to=20
two subse-quent months in which their timely submission rates fall between=
=20
70% and 79%.  No fine or warning letter will be issued for a =01&do over=01=
8 month,=20
but the month will not count as a passing month.  A member who falls below=
=20
70% will receive a fine or warning letter.

_ The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted =
as=20
a failing month will not count at all, as long as the member achieved at=20
least a 70% rate.  Members still need four problem-free months to return to=
 a=20
warning letter stage.  A member who has been problem-free for 3 months woul=

having the opportunity to return to the warning letter stage despite=20
intervening failing months.  A member who falls below 70% before achieving=
=20
four problem-free months will receive a fine or a warning letter, as=20
appropriate.  The member can still use a second =01&do over=018 month as lo=
ng as he=20
meets all the above criteria.

_ Staff will follow up with members attending the classes.  Members will=20
receive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine.  They will also =
be=20
invited to discuss their percentages with staff on an individual basis. =20
Further, staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by e-ma=
il=20
or telephone upon request.

_ Members are eligible for only one class per year.  A member must take a=
=20
class to take advantage of the benefits listed herein.  Classes will be=20
offered on June 14, July 10 and August 15, 2001, and the program will apply=

to the next full month of audit trail statistics.  The Compliance Review=20
Committee and the Floor Committee will evaluate the results of this program=

before deciding whether to extend this program into 2002.




Incorporation of Spreads into One-Minute
Trade Time =01&Pit Card=018 Statistics for NYMEX Division

Present one-minute trade time =01&pit card=018 statistics do not include sp=
read=20
times.  During the most recent NYMEX Rule Enforcement Review--the CFTC audi=
t=20
of the Exchange=01,s Compliance programs and procedures--the CFTC recommend=
ed=20
that the NYMEX Division incorporate spread trades into the one-minute time=
=20
statistics.  The CFTC has made this recommendation in the past and the=20
Exchange has committed to respond to it. The COMEX Division one-minute trad=
e=20
time statistics already include spreads.

NYMEX Division Members should note that intra-commodity spread trades will =
be=20
incorporated into pit card one-minute trade time accuracy rates after a=20
=01&phase in=018 process of approximately 90 days.  In order to avoid subst=
andard=20
percentages once spreads are incorporated, members must make sure that thei=
r=20
spread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change=
=20
Register for spreads is accurate.  If a spread print is not reported, you=
=20
will not be credited with timely submission of pit cards, even if you throw=
=20
the trade into the pit in a timely manner.

Pit card statistics for outright trades are presently posted on the NYMEX=
=20
floor on a weekly basis.  Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics=
=20
for outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread=20
trades.  These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you=
=20
can assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of=20
spreads in the one-minute trade time submission percentages.  For informati=
on=20
purposes, the seller of the spread is considered to be the party who sells=
=20
the premium month.  In the case where the spread trades flat, the seller is=
=20
the party who sells the nearby month.

Any comments on the below?

Thanks,

",Joe,,Mark/Brent
1651,"Mark

I understand that you oversee the legal issues/contracts relating to our 
financial trading activities and consequently was hoping you might be able to 
assist us in regard to the following query that relates to sourcing data from 
external financial information providers.

I work in EnronCredit.com as a Telecommunication analyst and am interested in 
accessing the above information source which is provided by Thomson 
Financial.  FYI, ""FirstCall"" allows online realtime access to a wide variety 
of debt and equity focused investment house/broker reports.

We originally had access via a trial that was apparently initiated by a ""C. 
Weber"" who was based out of Houston but who has subsequently left the company.

Unfortunately, access to this service has been withdrawn by Thomson Financial 
here in London on the basis that we are a ""corporate"" and not a ""financial"" 
or ""fund manager"".  Thomson Financial are now offering us a reduced 
time-delayed service (""Investex"") which is not sufficient for our needs and 
consequently we would like to reestablish the FirstCall service or a service 
providing similar or superior functionality.

Prior to meeting with Thomson, I would very grateful if you could enlighten 
us on any of the following:

- Whether Enron has any relationship and/or agreements in place with Thomson 
Financial in the US;
- If the latter is the case, which services we receive from this data 
supplier;
- If this is not the case, which alternative but similar data services we do 
receive.

I believe that if we can establish that we already receive the FirstCall 
service in the US it would greatly strengthen our case for receiving it here 
in the UK.  Alternatively, if we do not receive this service in the US it 
would be extremely valuable for us to know what alternative, but similar, 
sources of information are available, in order that we might have another 
option should Thomson Financial prove to be inflexible on the issue of 
supplying FristCall.

Should you have any queries in relation to any of the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me either by return or on the direct number below.

Thanks for your help with this.

Moderating weather conditions on the TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE)
pipeline system will allow a limited amount of Due Shipper pay back to
be available over the weekend.  Shippers should schedule any imbalance
payback with their Operations Account Manager.

Customers that are in a Due Pipe position should be scheduling imbalance
makeup to the pipe through their Operations Account Manager.

All shippers and point operators should endeavor to stay balanced daily.
The opportunity to make up or pay back imbalances is entirely dependent
on the operating conditions of the pipe from day to day.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

Breaking News : posted Oct 25, 11:12 AM
Breathitt 'Uneasy' About Approach to Pipe Certification 
Although FERC and California regulators have made a lot of headway in past months in their effort to relieve the imbalance between in-state and interstate pipeline capacity, Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Wednesday that she still is somewhat unsettled by FERC's tendency to routinely approve interstate pipe projects without giving full weight to the impact on existing shippers. 
""I remain uneasy about the...policies the Commission has advanced in favor of certification of interstate capacity despite the [inadequacy] of takeaway capacity and particularly the confidence with which the Commission has rejected the legitimate concerns of shippers on [Kern River's] system,"" she said during the regular FERC meeting. 
Breathitt's remarks were part of a concurring opinion on two orders in which FERC denied rehearing of its certificate approval for Kern River Gas Transmission's 2002 Expansion Project and California Action Project [CP01-31, CP01-106-001]. Firm customers of Kern River sought reconsideration of the certificate orders on the grounds that the expansions would result in pro-rata capacity reductions for existing shippers at Wheeler Ridge and would diminish their firm delivery rights. 
Despite her concerns, Breathitt noted that she was ""pleased that over the past six months the Commission has come to acknowledge that our actions in certificating the Kern River expansions could exacerbate the problems of delivering natural gas to end-users in Southern California."" 
Even more importantly, ""the Commission has recognized the potential degradation of shippers' firm rights resulting from the certification of additional interstate capacity is an appropriate factor in the public benefits analysis that we use to determine whether a project is in the public convenience and necessity,"" she said. 
Moreover, ""I am relieved that certain events are occurring in California that will mitigate congestion at Wheeler Ridge. More takeaway capacity is on the horizon, and the California PUC is considering certain regulatory relief that will facilitate the transportation of natural gas from Wheeler Ridge to Southern California markets."" 
Nevertheless, Breathitt urged her FERC colleagues ""not [to] lose sight of the panoply of issues we must consider in issuing natural gas pipeline certificates."" 
This doesn't mean, however, that she is against all new pipelines and expansion projects, Breathitt said. ""I most certainly share the sense of urgency to ensure adequate and reliable energy supplies. However, there is more to the Commission's mandate under the Natural Gas Act than simply getting more pipe in the ground."" 
Breathitt noted that the Commission plans to revisit the issue of the adequacy of California takeaway capacity when it takes up Kern River's pending application for its proposed 2003 Expansion Project [CP01-422]. Firm customers on the pipeline have already protested the application. They claim that Kern River has sold nearly 500,000 Dth/d of additional primary firm delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge in the three expansion projects, and that they are experiencing scheduling cuts as a result. 
When the Kern River 2003 expansion comes before the Commission, ""I will continue to advocate a thoughtful and coordinated approach to fostering badly needed interstate and intrastate expansion in California.""

1682,"Patti Sullivan has cerated a new El Paso interruptible contract for 
delivering to Griffith.  It is an Enron contract.  This agreemnet is 9M52.  
For the gas we delivered yesterday, we will be invoicing Citizens based on 
deliveries as a special deal over and above our base deal.  You will have an 
imbalance at Griffith that will go to your OBA.  I will get you the price 
later today.

Nogales used some gas last month.  Citizens has an IT contract 989N that we 
can use to deliver to this point.  I am still a little uncertain as to how 
you want us to handle this.  Please advise if the following procedure is how 
you want it handled:

1.  EPMI will deliver gas to Nogales on 989N
2.  When gas is delivered, we will bill Citizens based on the price when gas 
is delivered rather then when used, as you want this account isolated.
3.  We should ""0-out"" any current imbalance position at Noglaes based on 1 
and 2 above.
