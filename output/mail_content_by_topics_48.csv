1,"Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

Phillip"

Greg,

I plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  

The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  

The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.

Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender?

I will follow up with a phone call.

Thanks,

Phillip"

7,"Jeff,

Here is the application from SPB.  I guess they want to use the same form as 
a new loan application.  I have a call in to Lee O'Donnell to try to find out 
if there is a shorter form.  What do I need to be providing to the buyer 
according to the contract.  I was planning on bringing a copy of the survey 
and a rentroll including deposits on Monday.  Please let me know this morning 
what else I should be putting together.

8,"Forward Reg Dickson's resume to Ted Bland for consideration for the trading 
track program.  He is overqualified and I'm sure too expensive to fill the

10,"Hello Mr. Arnold,

I hope that things have calmed down in the gas market with the cold weather
finally developing.  I have been selected to come to Houston for final round
interviews.  Do you know if visitors can come to the trading floor to see
what the operations are like?  Also, if you have any hints on approaching
the final round of interviews, I would appreciate them.

Thank you for your help during the application process, and I hope you have
a good week.

Cordially,

Adam Bayer"

14,"I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better 
replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why 
the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous 
methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 
while Cal 10 was .256.  
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the 
summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months 
of July and August over time.

The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for 
the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows:

Jan  -.008
Feb -.004
Mar -.001
Apr .002
May .003
Jun .004
Jul .004
Aug .004
Sep .003
Oct .002
Nov -.003
Dec -.006


These premiums start in Jan 2004
On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 
4/5 spread was marked at .0475.  
In the old methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965
Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044


In the new methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885
Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028

The only change in the formula is from:
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table
to
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month 
premium table

The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I 
change them"
15,"remind jim how the h/j/k spread acted this year.  granted it won't behave 
that way again until close to expiry, but i like the j/k outright much moreso 
than the condor.

18,"Thanks, Chaz, for the response.  What I am looking for in question #3 
(purchase commitment) is did I convey the info correctly re:  what BMC will 
accept from Enron to allow the EBS deal to close?  From notes to the Net 
Works directors and Bob McAuliffe, I have copied the following statements 
into the space below:  

""1)  The pricing is applicable if EBS gets their deal done, and you are 
willing to provide some form of commitment (at least in writing, either 
e-mail or letterhead) to purchasing a BMC product in 2001...  For example, if 
Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their current 
testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail (or 
other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001 (the 
preference would be to get the ""buy"" done by end of 1st Qtr, if possible).  
This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with their 
purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC.""  Is this correct the 
way I have presented it to NetWorks?  Will their replies work for you if 
completed as requested above?
 
I didn't want to put you in a bind when I told the NetWorks teams what BMC 
would feel is acceptable proof-of-commitment, nor did I want to have to go 
back to the Net Works group and change the requirements.

I've got another note to send you in a minute or so, from Doug Cummins.

Thank you,
Jeff





"
19,"i think you're absolutely right about q/u.  again just a question of when to 
put it on.  Seems as if I'm always on the offer of that spread.  yesterday i 
had a 4.5 offer all day and i think i got 50 or so.  i can almost leg it 
better by buying winter and selling summer and the j/q spread. i would like 
to see it widen another penny before stepping in and i think with the 
weakness in the winter and relative weakness of cal 2, on any rally that 
could happen.

was that you on the q/u/v fly yesterday?"
20,"he sends me his stuff... i like him because he's willing to take a stand.  so 
many technicians bullshit  their way ""support at 5400-5600 but if it breaks 
that look for 5250"".  if every technician put specific trades on a sheet with 
entry and exit points and published them every day, a lot of people would be 
unemployed.

checking to see if you're still on for dinner.   wine room at aldo's at 7:00. 
drinks at your place before?

23,"Karen,

Thank you for the update.  It looks like we'll plan on having the EBS/Avaya 
meetings on January 10th and 11th, 2001.  The first day will be a full day, 
the second will be 1/2 day, a.m. session.  You have asked me to provide a 
list of Enron attendees, titles, which day(s) they would likely attend, and 
some background information on the meeting(s) purposes.  An explanation of 
the meetings' proposed focus and probable attendees is in the attached 
meeting notes.  

The notes are from the November meeting which we coordinated and held for 
Enron Broadband Services and Dave Johnson.  By copy of this note to Kim 
Godfrey, we'll update the EBS executives on the meetings, and work on 
arranging their calendar availability.  So far, we have had the EBS execs' 
calendars penciled in for the time slot of January 9-11.  At this point, I 
would expect that the EBS attendee list would look something like this:  

Jim Crowder, VP, Enterprise Services; Enron Broadband Services - day 2 
Everett Plante, VP and CIO, Enron Broadband Services - day 2
Larry Ciscon, VP Software Architecture, EBS - day 1&2
  (selected team members of Larry's organization - individuals TBD by Larry) 
- day 1  
Steve Pearlman, VP, Strategic Development, EBS - day 2 and/or day 1
Kim Godfrey, Director, East Origination, EBS - day 1&2  
Jeff Youngflesh, Director, Business Development, Enron Global Strategic 
Sourcing - day 1&2  
    (others as suggested by Kim Godfrey or other EBS executive)

From Avaya, the EBS team would like to meet with Dave Johnson, Serge 
Minassian, John Stephenson, and their selected Avaya team members.  

Per my conversation with you earlier today, the Enron Broadband Services 
meetings w/Avaya will need to be scheduled such that the overall agenda will 
""flip-flop"" day 1 with day 2.  Originally, the first day was going to be a 
half-day executive strategizing meeting in the p.m. (allowing for travel to 
NJ), and the 2nd day to be more a product- or solutions-focused effort, with 
a full day's agenda.  Based on the fact that Dave Johnson will only be 
available the morning of the 11th, the meeting schedule will be reversed, 
such that the ""full day/products/solutions"" meetings will precede the 
half-day executive strategy sessions.  I have checked w/Barbara Korp, and 
Serge Minassian and John Stephenson are both available on the 11th, as well 
(John Stephenson would have a hard stop at 10:30).


Thank you,

Jeff Youngflesh

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

wines from France, Italy, Australia, California and Spain. Looking for
more ""perfect"" wines? How about Harlan Estate 1997 in a magnum, Robert
M. Parker Jr. 100 pts, and Chateauneuf du Pape Reserve des Celestins
(Henri Bonneau) 1990, Parker 100 pts. Find them here:
http://www.winebid.com/home/spotlight4.shtml

For ""perfect"" Bordeaux, may we suggest Beausejour (Duffau-Lagarrosse)
1990, a Robert M. Parker Jr. 100 pt wine. Wine Spectator called it
""liquid cashmere."" We offer too Haut-Brion 1989, Parker 100 pts. Wine
Spectator gave the same wine 97 pts and called it ""Superb. Great
Future."" Find them here:
http://www.winebid.com/home/spotlight2.shtml

The greatest Shiraz ever produced in Australia? Robert M. Parker Jr.
thinks Three Rivers Shiraz 1995 may be just that. He gave the wine 99
pts and called it ""A virtually perfect wine of splendid concentration,
symmetry, and length (nearly a minute). This may be the greatest Shiraz
produced in Australia."" It is part of an extraordinary Three Rivers
Shiraz Vertical 1989 - 1995. Find it here:

obtain up to 3,000 MW of new generation resources to allow the ISO to
operate the ISO Control Area to meet Applicable Reliability Criteria under
peak Demand conditions during the Summer Period of 2001.

While the ISO seeks to acquire generation resources under this RFB through
one-year agreements, it will also consider bids that require an ISO
commitment for the Summer Periods of 2002 and 2003 if responses proposing
one-year arrangements prove insufficient to meet the ISO's requirements.

The RFB is attached to this email and posted on the ISO Web site at

Brent has reviewed the Assignment and suggests that we use the ENA form of Assignment.  Reason being -- the last B of A deal (when using their document), which involved a similar scenario was abit confusing.

Brent said our form will be with PCS as assignor rather than ENA.  
However, before we can finalize -- Credit must approve.

Jay,

Please advise if assignment of PCS deals are OK with Credit.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Quinton Spotwood , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00 
 Spotwood was signed to the New York Giants' practice squad on Tuesday. He 
had been in both Dallas and Miami's camps during the season. Spotwood has no 
Fantasy value.   

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of 
schedule in his return from a sprained knee. If all goes well, he could play 
in the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale 
against Green Bay on December 24. It's probably best to keep Alstott on your 
bench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could 
make an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things 
quickly.  

 Chad Morton , RB NO - Fear Updated 12/12/00 
 Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a 
separated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last 
Sunday. We don't recommend him for your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 Head Coach Jim Haslett says he hopes to re-sign Moore, who was placed on 
waivers on Saturday. Moore became expendable with the addition of veteran 
Terry Allen, and won't have any Fantasy value even if he returns.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Hatchette injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last Sunday's game 
against St. Louis. He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday 
against Green Bay. He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, 
though.  

 Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent 
surgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek. He suffered the injury 
during last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game. Walsh has 
been valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but 
he's not a viable Fantasy option.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/12/00 
 The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during 
practice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against 
Cincinnati. He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's 
game, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards. 
Hopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at 
running back during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against 
Tennessee due to a sprained ankle. Believe it or not, this likely hurts the 
Browns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last 
Sunday against Philadelphia. It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this 
stage of the Fantasy season.  

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to 
an over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday. Still, his 
status for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to 
keep him on your bench this week.  

 Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday 
against San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts. 
One possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when 
he was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to 
McNown. We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing 
the weak Niners' pass defense.   

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 
 Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to 
practice on Wednesday. Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, 
we wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.  

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Fear Updated 12/12/00 
 Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be 
benched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games. Nothing 
is worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer 
clear of both players if at all possible.  

 Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the 
final two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for 
2001. Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to 
determine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future. On the other hand, 
Beuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB 
and may not want to end it. Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your 
Fantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.  

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve 
on Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it 
certainly showed on Monday night. Although Indianapolis did score two 
defensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to 
Indy. Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their 
former selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your 
Fantasy team.   

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field 
goals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter. He is 
one of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly 
starter on your Fantasy team.   

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and 
hasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets. What little 
Fantasy value he may have had early in the season is all but gone now.   

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday 
night's win over Buffalo. He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, 
missing only two field goals the entire season. Starting Vanderjagt this week 
is a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many 
touchdowns.   

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, 
and hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five. Translation: Avoid starting 
Pollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.   

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 12/12/00 
 With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on 
Monday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought. Avoid starting him if 
your roster allows it.  

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills. 
At this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.   

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 12/12/00 
 Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two 
passes for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis. In the last two 
weeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns. 
Fantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy 
playoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.    

 Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 
 Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown 
performance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday 
night. Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a 
receiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two 
weeks of the season.    

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - The Lie Downs Updated 12/12/00 
 To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in 
Monday night's game with the Bills. He caught only two passes for 27 yards 
against what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which 
may have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs. If you 
were lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against 
the Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins. In the team's first meeting, 
Harrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.     

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Rounders Updated 12/12/00 
 Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four 
passes for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts. These 
were the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from 
Price, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your 
starting lineup.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with 
an ankle injury. He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown 
in the Bills' 44-20 loss. Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn 
Bryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of 
Buffalo's tailbacks at this point.  

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 12/12/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, 
rushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.  His main production, however, came 
through the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards. Bryson's 120 yards 
of total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for 
Fantasy owners at this point in the season.    

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 
 ""The Edge"" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 
yards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over 
Buffalo. James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him 
back in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone. When it comes really 
comes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it 
wouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy 
playoffs.  

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - The Lie Downs Updated 12/12/00 
 Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing 
13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win. 
It was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one 
touchdown pass in a game. If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy 
performance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami. The Dolphins 
have two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, 
so it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par 
performance. At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the 
former Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised 
kidney this week. Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers 
against an opportunistic Oakland defense.

1
REACTION TO GOVERNOR BUSH'S STATEMENT

RE: What Gore needs to consider:
""The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like, and
that Gore requested.  Bush still won counting with Gore's
rules... [Gore has] to consider where reasonable people in the
center are going to look at this, and say, 'Guys you had your
shot, the count, the recount - they changed the rules for you
and you still did not win.'  It's time to be magnanimous.

RE: Governor Bush's Speech:
""...the tone...was perfect...

""There was a persistence and a determination in what
[Governor Bush] said, but it was also incredibly conciliatory.
It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has
given in this, and that probably goes to peoples hearts.""

     - Bob Woodward on Larry King Live, CNN, 11/26/00

STATEMENT BY GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH

The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  As our
nation watched, we were all reminded on a daily basis of the
importance of each and every vote.  We were reminded of the
strength of our democracy - that while our system is not always
perfect, it is fundamentally strong and far better than any
other alternative.

The election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount
and yet another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are
honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida, which
gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election.  We
will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to
serve as America's next President and Vice President.

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY JAMES A. BAKER, III

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Shortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in
this very room that the election process in - Florida and in
the country as a whole - needed to conclude with fairness and
finality.

I suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about
what was at stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable
end to the process of counts, challenges and contests if it
slipped away from us.

So here is the account of the past 3 weeks.

STATEMENT BY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER BOB CRAWFORD
Democrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission

Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job
that you and your office have done during these last almost
three weeks since the election.

This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty.
But we got the job done, and we got it done right. People
called me and say--particularly from out of state--and say
what's going on down in Florida, and I have to keep reminding
people, the only thing that's going on here is that we've got
a razor-thin election for the most important job in the world.

And that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the
anguish, we've just got a close election. And any state that
had to go through this would've had the same problems, I think,
that we have had.

But I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the
important word there, ""should."" You know, Yogi Berra once said,
""It's not over till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a
winner, and it's time to move on.

There's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have
enough legal talent to keep this tied up through  Christmas.
But one thing the lawyers can't do for us and one thing the
courts can't do for us: They can't bring this country together
again.

And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight,
it's going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this
country together again, and I hope we can get on with that work
soon.

And I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state.

GORE JUST SPINNING ABOUT SUPREME COURT, SAYS EXPERT
Fox News Channel, 11/26/00

FOX NEWS' BRIT HUME: ""...does the Gore team not have something
to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court
coming up on Friday.  That-that creates sort of a period of
continuing, a sort of unfinality if such a word exists.""

NATIONAL JOURNAL'S STUART TAYLOR: ""...Unless I'm missing
something that is completely hollow spin.  There is nothing
what so ever, I think-that the Supreme Court of the United
States can do for Al Gore.  They could do some things for
George W. Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do anything
except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done.
But I don't think he's in the position to say, ""Oh by the way
could you order some more recounts?""  So I think there is
nothing, if...Gore runs out of ammunition.  Which I think he
may well do, before the Supreme Court of the United States gets
to a hearing.  I think he has to give up, because there's
nothing...""

165,"Dear Friend,

Thousands more Americans have signed their Petition to
Certify the Bush Victory at
http://www.electionIntegrity2000.com . We=01,re building a tidal
wave of public support for fairness and integrity in the
aftermath of this presidential election.

Make no mistake, Al Gore=01,s team of lawyers and activists are
fighting to the finish in a desperate attempt to overturn the
results in Florida.  Here=01,s the latest:

After hand picking Florida counties to conduct recount after
recount and using the Florida Supreme Court to help them
rewrite the election rules, it still didn=01,t look like Al Gore
was going to be able to manufacture enough votes to win.  But
they want this election and they=01,re not giving up without a
fight.

Statistically, early returns from the manual recounts (hand-
counts) did not show Al Gore overtaking George W. Bush=01,s lead
in Florida.  So the Democrats have simply changed the
""hand-counting"" rules again.  The new rules say that ballots
with dimples, loose chad or any indentation in the area of
the box should be counted.

No punch hole in the ballot is necessary for Gore to gain
a vote!

This amounts to mind reading because the activists conducting
the recount are allowed to divine the intent of the voter.

Gore=01,s team argues that ""every vote should be counted"" hoping
to gain votes in their favor, but they use every technicality
to disqualify thousands of military ballots delivered without
a post mark.  Why?

Because these ballots likely favor Bush at a rate of 2 to 1!

And even though military servicemen abroad can=01,t control how
their mail is delivered, Gore=01,s allies are fighting to deny
their votes.

We the American people must fight this systematic and
calculated effort to overturn the election.  We must fight
in the media.  We must fight in the courts.  We must fight
in the Florida legislature.  We must fight for public
opinion.

One way you can help is by urging your friends and family to
join our online campaign to Certify the Bush Victory at
http://www.algorelost.org or
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com right now.

Spread the word by forwarding this e-mail!

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

ROCKETS 5-GAME OUTLOOK 

The Rockets kick off a four-game West Coast road trip tonight in Sacramento. Other stops include Portland (Tuesday), Seattle (Friday) and L.A. to take on the Clippers (Sunday). Houston will then return home Tuesday, November 27 to host the Kings.

Or details about the next five games, check out the Rockets 5-Game Outlook (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=134695&UID=45456540&MID=188637). 

 

ROCKETS ACTIVATE DAN LANGHI

The Houston Rockets have placed guard Tierre Brown on the injured list with plantar fasciitis of the left foot, General Manager Carroll Dawson has announced. In a related move, the Rockets activated forward Dan Langhi from the injured list.

Brown has seen action in one regular season game, recording two points and three assists while making his NBA debut at Denver on Nov. 9. The 6-foot-2, 189-pound rookie averaged 4.0 points and 2.3 assists for Houston in four preseason games. The McNeese State product received All-Southland Conference honors following each of the last two college basketball seasons.

Langhi has been sidelined for Houston's first nine games with a right ankle sprain. The 6-foot-11, 22-0 pound forward averaged 5.8 points and 1.8 rebounds in five Rockets preseason games. Langhi averaged 2.7 points and 1.2 rebounds as a rookie last year after being named the 2000 Southeastern Conference Player of the Year with Vanderbilt the previous season. 

 

WATCH AND WIN ON UPN 20!

MO' BETTA BUNCH

Houston Rockets forward Maurice Taylor (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=134697&UID=45456540&MID=188637) has purchased 40 regular season tickets and will donate all of the seats to local non-profit community groups that serve underprivileged children. Taylor plans to make the Rockets home game seats available to the community groups throughout the remainder of the 2001-2002 NBA season. Appropriately dubbed the ""Mo'Betta Bunch,"" Taylor's charitable endeavor will touch the lives of
more than 1,400 children in the Houston area. 

Each ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" group attending a Rockets home game will receive reserved seating in Compaq Center, designated with a special, brightly colored banner, and an exclusive, red T-shirt sporting Taylor's name and Rockets jersey number. Schedule permitting, Taylor intends to personally welcome each ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" group to the game prior to tipoff.

""I am very pleased to have the opportunity to help our deserving youth and provide a Rockets game experience,"" said Taylor. ""Having the ability to touch so many young lives and make a positive impact is truly rewarding.""

The Rockets Community Services Department will be responsible for selection of groups to participate in ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" and the distribution of tickets and T-shirts. 

The goal of Taylor's ticket donation program is to help non-profit groups who are already making a difference in the lives of children, but who lack the finances to provide extra-curricular activities.

 

INSIDE THE ROCKETS

Inside the Rockets is your chance to get up close and personal with Rockets players throughout the season. Each Monday we will ask a different question and the players' responses to that question will be posted. Be sure to check back each week to see their answers to an all-new question!

 

This week, Rockets players respond to the question:
""Who do you think was the most influential person in history?""

Hi Folks,

Here's the latest thing I know on Anthony Thomas from our good friend Bob
Harris of the www.tflreport.com .   Thanks Bob and Happy Thanksgiving
Everyone.

THOMAS SKIPS PRACTICE TO REST SORE HAMSTRING...
"
197,"Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1123/1283244.html


Rookie Anthony Thomas, who has emerged as the Chicago Bears' top running
back this season, may miss Sunday's NFC Central clash against the Minnesota
Vikings.

Thomas, who has 638 rushing yards and four touchdowns, has been downgraded
to doubtful for Sunday's game with a strained right hamstring.

James Allen, a 1,000-yard rusher last season who lost his job to Thomas,
likely would start if Thomas is inactive for Sunday's game.

This is a crucial game for both teams. The Bears (7-2) need the victory to
stay ahead of the Packers in the Central, and the Vikings (4-5) need the win
simply to stay in the hunt for a playoff spot.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


It's a dice roll here, folks.   He hasn't practiced all week and James Allen
has been working with the first team.   If you don't have anyone close to
Thomas' ability, you might roll the dice with him but if you've got another
option, I'd probably go with the safer route.   From Coach Dick Jauron's
eyes, I'm guessing he sees Allen as not a horrible choice plus the fact he
wants to get Allen healthy for the stretch run and playoffs.   Just my guess
though.

Joe

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars receiver Jimmy Smith tested
positive for cocaine after police stopped him Nov. 11 on suspicion of
drunken driving, but he will not be prosecuted.

Smith could face disciplinary action from the NFL for violating the league's
substance abuse policy.

NFL spokesman Dan Masonson said the league was reviewing Smith's case.

Smith denied having taken cocaine, and said he was trying to figure out how
the test could have returned positive.

""I've never done it, don't do it and don't plan to do it,"" Smith said. ""I
just hate for my name to be associated with anything like that, ever. Since
I've been here, I've been a good role model, and I will continue to be a
good role model. It's devastating to me and my family, but life goes on.""

Coach Tom Coughlin said Smith told him he did not take cocaine.

""This is a person I've had a long relationship with,"" Coughlin said. ""He
looks me in the eye and tells me he didn't do it, I'm going to believe it.""

Smith passed two breath tests after he was stopped, but police took a urine
sample, which was sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for
analysis.

Smith tested positive for cocaine, Assistant State Attorney John Guy said
Monday.

Guy said his office would not prosecute Smith for drunken driving because he
did not have a blood-alcohol level above the state's .08 limit. Smith also
will not be prosecuted on drug charges.

""He didn't have anything on his person when he was arrested,"" Guy said.
""There was only cocaine in his system, and for that I can't prosecute.""

Smith, who has been to the last four Pro Bowls, was third in the AFC in
receptions with 70 this season -- one in which most people didn't think he
would play.

He had three abdominal operations in the off-season, lost about 20 pounds
and spent about a month in the hospital.

This is something that's been rumored for the last few days and looks like
the rumors had some merit behind them.   You'll have to wait to see how it
shakes out.   Tough news all the way around but it's still very unclear what
(if any) action the league will take.   More as we hear it.

205,"Congratulations on the wedding!  A sister, finally!  I'm sure your family is
really excited!  As for Enron, you are right, things will happen for the
best.  They always do for you, Ner.

I know what it is like to go through changes, I feel as though I have had so
many over the past year.  Luckily, it seems as though they have all been for
the best.

I'm glad you responded, it is always nice to hear about you and your family!
  I'm always interested in hearing what is going on in your life.

I saw your brother's friend, James not too long ago, I'm not sure if he
recognized me at first or not, but he said hello.  Tell you brother
congratulations for me please, and the family ""hi.""

210,"Hi Folks,

Once again, our Footballguy Scott Luebke throws out what he sees for this
week's Upgrades and Downgrades.

Enjoy.

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades

QB - Tom Brady - Brady has remains the starter in New England despite the
return of Drew Bledsoe from injury.  Some analysts may question the fact
that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury, but no one can question Brady's
effectiveness on the football field.  A 258 yard, 4 touchdown performance
keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter.  Keep in mind, the Patriots
have a bye in week 16.

QB - Kordell Stewart - Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second
consecutive multiple touchdown game.  Stewart finished the game with 254
passing yards, 54 rushing yards and 3 total touchdowns.  The schedule looks
good for Stewart down the stretch, especially with games against Detroit and
Cincinnati in weeks 15 and 16.

QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris
Chambers.  Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season, but his
upside is good.  A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season
should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.  Look for another quality performance against the 49ers
this weekend.

RB - Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season, Rhodes
has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense.  He produced on Sunday with
147 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  Two consecutive difficult games against
Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down, but a strong finish to the season
is in store.  With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions, look
for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes.

RB - Antowain Smith - Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with
153 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  However, now is the time to trade Smith
away.  His value has hit an all-time high and the remainder of the season
will be difficult with Cleveland, Miami and a bye week remaining.

RB - Ahman Green - Green has struggled the last few weeks, but was able to
bust out on Thanksgiving Day with 150 total yards and 2 scores.  Look for
the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the
season.  As the winter weather approaches, Favre and the passing game will
become more conservative, which will result in more dump off passes to the
talented Green.  Don't be surprised if Green receives 30+ touches/game the
remainder of the season.

RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson's statistics have suffered over the
last several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run.  In order to get
the ball in Tomlinson's hands more often, Turner called several short
passing plays to get LT in the open field.  The plan was successful as
Tomlinson caught 13 passes for 72 yards.  The fantasy playoffs look good for
Tomlinson with Oakland, Kansas City and Seattle on the schedule for weeks
14, 15, and 16.

RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with 106 rushing
yards and 2 touchdowns.  In the last 4 games, Hearst has averaged 106
rushing yards/game.  With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on
Sunday to go along with an already injured quad, Hearst will continue to see
20+ touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs
as long as he remains healthy.

WR - Derrick Alexander - Good news for Alexander owners...it appears that he
is 100% healthy for the first time this season.

WR - Eric Moulds - Throughout the week, Moulds was complaining about the
lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him.  Well,
the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball.  What
happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds?  He produced (196 yards and 2
touchdowns).

WR - Chris Chambers - The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with
101 receiving yards and 2 fabulous touchdowns.  Chambers is the big play
threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action.  Keep in
mind, Chambers is a boom/bust option at receiver.  He'll dazzle you one week
and disappear the next week.  This guy is going to be special, so grab him
in dynasty leagues.

WR - David Boston - Plain and simple...the man.  A few weeks ago, the knock
on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring.  Well, 4 touchdowns in 3 weeks
should quiet the critics.

WR - Kevin Johnson - Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday
with 113 yards and a touchdown.  Johnson is Tim Couch's clear cut #1
receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the
season.

WR - Troy Brown - Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent
basis.  With 7 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, Brown
continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady.  Keep in mind, New
England has a bye in week 16, so Brown will not be available for the
majority of championship games.  Plan accordingly.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downgrades

QB - Trent Green - Green's disappointing season continues.  He looked good
with 256 passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday.  However, he was
unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade.  With
the healthy return of Alexander at wide receiver, Green's stock could be on
the rise in the near future.  Green's value is at its lowest point, so you
could probably get him for relatively cheap.  He's not an every week
starter, but he might have a few big games left for this season.

QB - Donovan McNabb - McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the
last two weeks (221 passing yards and 1 touchdown).  His pride of wanting to
be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production.
McNabb's value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some
plays. Right now, McNabb should still be considered a top 10 fantasy
quarterback.  However, if his lack of production continues, his stock will
drop quickly.

QB - Brian Griese - Griese's receiving options are limited, which is
directly affecting his production.  Rod Smith limped through Thursday's game
with an ankle injury.  A healthy return of Smith will boost Griese's stock.
However, Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver
position.  His production is limited, if he is forced to throw to the tight
end position the majority of the time.

QB - Daunte Culpepper - Culpepper did not pass/score a touchdown for the
first time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the Vikings.
Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week.

RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held out of Sunday's game with a hamstring
injury.  He's expecting to play this weekend against Detroit, but this is
not a guarantee.  With James Allen being effective, it would not surprise me
to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy
hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs.  A big game looms in two
weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that
game.

RB - Emmitt Smith - Smith was held to 9 yards on 9 carries during the
Thanksgiving Day game.  Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game,
Smith's numbers will remain meager.

RB - Ron Dayne - With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option
in the rushing game, Dayne's fantasy value has dropped very low.  Dayne had
26 yards on 6 carries.  Barber had 124 rushing yards on 19 carries, 5
receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown.  Keep Dayne on your bench.

RB - Jason Brookins - Brookins broke his foot in Sunday's game against the
Jaguars.  He is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks.  Drop him and add someone
else to the roster.

RB - Eddie George - George's disappointing season continues with 58 yards on
15 carries this past Sunday.  George is currently tied with Randy Moss for
""Fantasy Disappointment of the Year"".

RB - Maurice Smith - Smith sprained his ankle on Sunday and managed to
return to the game.  However, Smith gained a meager 57 yards on 21 carries
and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain.  Evaluate his progress later
this week.

WR - Jimmy Smith - Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after
being pulled over by police.  No legal action will occur, but some sort of
suspension could be handed down by the commissioner's office.  Not a good
sign as we head closer to the fantasy playoffs.

WR - Peter Warrick - Warrick suffered a bruised shoulder against Cleveland
on Sunday. He was held to 1 reception for 22 yards and has not scored a
touchdown since week 4 of the season.  Keep him on your bench until the
Cincinnati passing game reappears.

WR - Randy Moss - Moss was held to 25 yards on 4 catches Sunday night.  Moss
is the most talented receiver in the league, but appears to lose
concentration from time to time.  Keep in mind, his potential for explosive
games is enormous.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire

Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14
team leagues.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.

RB - James Allen - Allen stepped in for the injured Anthony Thomas and
performed admirably.  With Thomas bothered by a hamstring injury, it's
highly possible that Allen could start against the lowly Detroit Lions this
weekend.  Chicago's defense is strong and the Bears like to grind it out on
the ground.

RB - Travis Minor - With Lamar Smith averaging just 2.3 yds/carry over the
last 6 games, Minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon.  In his
limited touches, Minor has looked good and could give the Dolphins offense a
much needed spark.

WR - Chris Chambers - This guy is good.  See description in upgrades
section.

TE - Eddie ""Boo"" Williams - I had Williams on the list last week and his
play on Sunday deserves another mention.  Although he had just 2 catches for
44 yards, Williams has explosive potential.  He nearly scored on a 25 yard
pass play, but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last second.
With Cam Cleeland remaining out with an injury, Williams is a tight end with
quality upside.

According to reports out of Foxboro, New England  Patriots quarterback Drew=

Bledsoe took his regular  turn at practice for the second day in a row Frid=
ay=20
and all  indications are the veteran signal caller will start and play as =
=20
usual against the Chiefs Monday night.=20

Of course, that hardly means Bledsoe is  100 percent healthy; he's anything=

but. And whether it's jammed,  bruised, sprained, fractured, broken or just=
=20
plain old sore, the  real problem is trying to figure out just how badly th=
e=20
thumb on his  throwing hand is injured and how much it affects his ability=
=20
to  throw the ball.=20

Not surprisingly, head coach Bill  Belichick says Bledsoe is no worse off=
=20
than he's been the  previous three weeks.=20

""This is the 13th week of the season.  There will be a lot of players out=
=20
there on both teams who will be  less than 100 percent, and (Chiefs=20
quarterback  Elvis) Grbac is one of them,"" said  Belichick. ""Same thing wit=
h=20
our quarterback. That's football in the  13th week of the season.""=20

Bledsoe came out of the chute strong in  Detroit on Thanksgiving day, but=
=20
regressed as the game progressed,  throwing two crucial fourth-quarter=20
interceptions that kept the team  from mounting a realistic comeback... And=
=20
even though Bledsoe  continues to insist the thumb isn't affecting his=20
throws, you'd be  hard-pressed to find any evidence backing that contention=
.=20

The bottom line here says a lack quality  depth at the key offensive skill=
=20
positions around him make it very  difficult to rely on Bledsoe for=20

Other items of interest...=20

Michael Felger of  the Boston Herald noted earlier this week that with  the=

weather sure to be an issue and Bledsoe at less-than-full speed,  coaches=

would love come out and run the ball on the Chiefs. The  question is whethe=

injury-prone J.R. Redmond will  be up to the task. If not, look for Belichi=

to spread the load  between Redmond and fellow rookie Patrick Pass. =20

Cincinnati Enquirer reporter  Tom Groeschen wrote this morning that Bengals=

head coach  Dick LeBeau characterized Scott Mitchell as  ""probable"" to star=

at quarterback when his team takes on the Cardinals  tomorrow.=20

Mitchell missed last week's game against Pittsburgh  because of a sprained=

Mitchell took the majority of snaps at Friday's  practice.=20

=01&I don't see any reason why I shouldn't be able to  go,=018 he said.=20

LeBeau said Mitchell probably won't need a Sunday  morning test, as he did=
=20
last week before the Pittsburgh game.=20

=01&I don't think that will be necessary, unless some  complications develo=

According to those who follow the team closely, the  Bengals would like to=

223,"TO ALL ELECTION INTEGRITY INTERNET ACTIVISTS:

Keep it up! The Democratic leadership is feeling the heat.

It's only a matter of time before they're going to have to
back off on their support for Al Gore and join the call for
him to concede.

For example, I just read an article about a Democratic mayor
of El Cajon, California who switched his party affiliation
from Democrat to Republican because he didn't like the dirty
tactics Al Gore is using to attempt to overturn the election.

Mayor Mark Lewis, had this to say, ""Over 600,000 servicemen
and women gave their lives in this last century to ensure
American freedoms, including our fundamental right to vote.
It is a despicable act to deny these brave people this same
right. I can no longer consider myself a Democrat when the
leader of the Democratic Party, supported by other elected
Democrat officials take this position. This is the final
straw. I didn't leave my party - my party left me.""

It's great news to see that people who voted for Al Gore and
even elected officials from his own party breaking ranks.

And Mayor Lewis is absolutely right.  Disenfranchising the
military is as low as you sink.  As American citizens we owe
a debt of gratitude to the military.

The least we can do is defend their fundamental right to
vote.

243,"I've had lots of folks ask for more details on the story I reported Monday
night as Denver QB Brian Griese made my ""Downgrade"" list in the ""Upgrades /
Downgrade"" article.

According to John Clayton of ESPN, Griese's shoulder injury is a separation
of the AC joint in his right clavicle.  He took a pain killing shot and
finished the game.   Unfortunately, his status for this week's game against
San Diego is in doubt.  At this point, coach Mike Shanahan is saying it will
be a couple of days before they decide what they're doing.

I've copied the entire story below if you'd like more details.  Sounds like
this victory could be one of those career turning point games for him.
Griese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket
because he could hear the crowd hold it's breath is classic.  I'll keep an
eye on it for you as this shakes out.

Joe



From the article:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1114/876898.html
DENVER -- Brian Griese had a secret. Mike Shanahan knew because he was the
head coach. Griese knew because he had the pain piercing in the middle of
his right shoulder.
His teammates didn't know what went on behind closed doors in Monday's
dramatic 27-24 Broncos victory over the Raiders at Mile High Stadium. All
his teammates knew was that he had injured his right shoulder on an
ill-advised run out of bounds minutes into the first quarter.
Griese retreated to the locker room with a trainer but wasn't missed. The
Raiders had an 11-play, field-goal drive that lasted six minutes. Teammates
saw Griese trot back to the field, warm up and miss only five plays. They
didn't hear that Griese had separated his right clavicle and AC joint and
needed a pain-deadening shot to finish the final three quarters.
""This is not a game I wanted to miss, and I was going to do anything
possible to get in the game and help my team win,"" Griese said. ""I was going
to do it. It was just the will to play and the will to win, and I wasn't
going to come out.""
An hour after the game, Broncos players were surprised that the man who ran
their huddle had a busted wing. His performance was John Elway-like for
courage, but it also leaves the Broncos uncertain if they will have Griese
available as a starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the San Diego
Chargers.
""We won't know for a couple of days the exact extent of the injury, but he's
such a competitor,"" Shanahan said. ""He's been like that since he's been
here. He wants to play, and sometimes you have to be cautious to make sure
he doesn't further hurt himself. That's the kind of guy he is.""
Rod Smith is among the many Broncos who have grown to love this guy. Last
year was different. In the preseason, it was supposed to be Bubby Brister's
team, but Shanahan named Griese the starter. Veterans didn't feel totally
comfortable with him. Griese didn't feel comfortable bossing around a group
of players who didn't take to him.
""Brian's the one to lead us,"" Smith said. ""I think it would have hurt him
more just sitting there and watching rather than being out there playing
with the shoulder the way it was. Whatever he does, he doesn't surprise me.
He's the best quarterback in the NFL. I know the Raiders think Rich Gannon
is. We think Brian is.""
Griese told his offensive players that he didn't have too much zip on the
ball. They accepted it as just humility.
""I wasn't throwing the ball as well I have been,"" Griese said. ""Some of the
balls just died. At that point, it was just your will to play, your will to
win. I wasn't coming out of the game.""
Griese was 22-of-32 for 221 yards with a separated shoulder. He'd throw
passes and hear, as well as feel, his shoulder popping in and out.
""I knew there was something wrong with it, but they assured me that I
couldn't do any further damage,"" Griese said. ""It was just whether I could
handle the pain.""
Being injured didn't make Griese shy away from contact. Several times he
took shots from Raiders defenders that bounced him to the frozen Mile High
Stadium grass. Once, cornerback Eric Allen charged untouched from the
blindside. Griese ducked as Allen hit him shoulder high.
""Believe it or not, the reason I kind of ducked when he came in is that I
heard the crowd, and the crowd held their breath and I could hear that,""
Griese said. ""I said to myself, 'Well, somebody must be ready to hit me.' ""
Talk about homefield advantage. Griese has never had an injury like this. He
has played two seasons with a torn labrum problem in his shoulder that
requires surgery, but this was much more painful.
Griese remembered a pass to Rod Smith along the sideline that was a big
play. He had to make just an arm-through pass. It was agonizing. He threw a
skinny post to Ed McCaffrey that left McCaffrey vulnerable to a hit on the
chin.
""I apologized to him for that because the ball kind of floated on me and I
didn't have any zip on the ball,"" Griese said.
Griese said the feeling of his shoulder popping in and out was different.
""We knew it was something that was hurting him, we knew he was banged up,""
fullback Howard Griffith said. ""That's how it is when you've got a job to
do.""
Still, the story told after the game amazed them.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 German was added to the injury report with a strained hamstring and is 
listed as probable for Sunday's game.  He was used as the third receiver 
earlier this season when Tim Dwight was sidelined with various injuries but 
has done little to push for extra playing time.  German has just one catch 
all season.     

 Packers , DT GB - Free Agent Updated 11/17/00 
 The Packers have a tough test ahead of them this week when they face the 
Colts and the trio of Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James, and Marvin Harrison.  
Their pass defense has been mediocre this season totaling 25 sacks and 
allowing 216.3 yards per game.  They will need to apply a little more 
pressure on Indianapolis to contain Manning and Harrison.  Look for Green Bay 
to come at Manning with multiple blitz coverages but that may not be enough 
for them to have success against the Colts and their balanced attack.    

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI - Fear Updated 11/17/00 
 Jones has come down with a case of walking pneumonia, and likely won't 
travel with the team on their trip to Philadelphia for this week's game 
against the Eagles. Jones has been a real disappointment to Fantasy owners 
thus far, accounting for only 410 yards of total offense and two touchdowns 
this season.  

 David Sloan , TE DET - The Lie Downs Updated 11/17/00 
 Sloan practiced Thursday and is expected to play in Sunday's game.  He is 
recovering from a pulled hamstring that kept him out of last week's game.  
Sloan has caught seven passes in his last two games but has failed to score  
a touchdown this season.    

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 11/17/00 
 With the injury to Sammy Morris, it looks as though Bryson will get the 
start this week against the Chiefs.  If Morris has been one of your main 
tailbacks this season, it may be a good idea to pick up Bryson if he is still 
available.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/17/00 
 Morris remains questionable for Sunday's game against the Chiefs with an 
ankle injury.  Head Coach Wade Phillips believes that Morris will be a 
game-time decision, so keep the Bills' rookie tailback on the bench this week 
if at all possible.   

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/17/00 
 Favre practiced Thursday and is expected to start Sunday's game at 
Indianapolis.  ""The ball came out sharp,"" said offensive coordinator Tom 
Rossley.  ""He was right on the money. I was pleased with what he did today.""  
If Favre can stay in the game this Sunday he could have a big day.  The Colts 
have one of the weaker pass defenses in the NFL, having allowed 15 TD passes 
this season.    

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Mean Machine Updated 11/16/00 
 Sanders had his best game in five weeks last Sunday, catching five passes 
for 82 yards in Arizona's 31-14 loss to the Vikings. He is currently battling 
a quadricep injury, but is listed as probable for this week's matchup with 
the Eagles.  It would be a wise move to bench Sanders this week, especially 
against an aggressive Philadelphia secondary.   

 Jake Plummer , QB ARI - FDIC Updated 11/16/00 
 Plummer completed 19-of-28 passes for 219 yards last Sunday against the 
Vikings, but was held without a touchdown pass.  In fact, ""The Snake"" has 
thrown only one touchdown pass in the last four weeks. Things won't get 
better for Plummer this week against the Eagles, who will blitz him 
relentlessly and likely force him to make bad decisions.    

 Troy Brown , WR NE - FDIC Updated 11/16/00 
 Brown caught only two passes for ten yards last Sunday against the Browns.  
Although he has shown flashes of brilliance in the past, Brown is far too 
inconsistent to be considered a starter by most Fantasy league standards.  

 Adam Vinatieri , K NE - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Vinatieri has connected on eight consecutive field goal attempts, dating 
back to Week Four against the Dolphins. With New England's offense sputtering 
in recent weeks, don't expect much from Vinatieri this week against the 
Bengals.    

 Rod Rutledge , TE NE - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Rutledge caught three passes for 20 yards last Sunday against the Browns, 
including his first career touchdown. With the release of Erich Bjornson, he 
should become more involved in the Patriots' offense in the coming weeks.  If 
you relied on Bjornson as your everday tight end, it would be a wise move to 
pickup Rutledge.     

 Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/16/00 
 Pickens was held out of practice yesterday because of his injured hamstring. 
He has missed four of his last six games, but Coach Jeff Fisher says that he 
is improving. Pickens will likely be a gametime decision.  

 Bashir Yamini , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 The Titans may need to make a roster move with their injuries at wide 
receiver. One possibility is to sign Yamini, who is on the practice squad and 
was on the roster earlier in the year, to replace Chris Jackson, who will be 
out for the remainder of the year with a herniated disc in his back. Jackson 
had recently been signed off the practice squad.  

 Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 George was able to participate fully in practice yesterday after receiving a 
cortisone shot for his injured right big toe earlier in the week. He plans on 
getting more involved in practice this week and hopes to get it strong enough 
to play Sunday against Cleveland. The only real concern here is whether 
George may develop turf toe, which could require surgery. Keep a close eye on 
him, and be sure to insure your roster with his backup, Rodney Thomas.  

 Wade Richey , K SF - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Richey has struggled recently missing four of his last six field-goal 
tries.  Last year Richey made 21-of-23 attempts.  He should get a lot of 
attempts this week against the Falcons.  San Francisco should be able to move 
the chains against Atlanta, but with Terrell Owens suffering from turf toe, 
The Niners will have problems scoring touchdowns.    

 Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Beasley missed last Sunday's game because of left-knee and ankle injuries 
and remains questionable for this week.  Terry Jackson will start at fullback 
if Beasley is unable to play.  In the beginning of the season the Niners 
threw to Beasley in goal-line situations.  Recently they have chosen to let 
Charlie Garner run the ball or to throw to their wideouts.   Beasley scored 
five touchdowns in the first three games, but has none since then.    

 Jerry Rice , WR SF - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/16/00 
 Rice sat out of practice Wednesday to rest his sore back.  He is expected to 
play this week and is listed as probable on the injury report.  Rice had five 
catches for 59 yards in the season opener against Atlanta.  At this point in 
his career Rice has very little Fantasy value.  He is being used mainly for 
routes over the middle and as a decoy in goal line situations.    

 Chad Dukes , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 To add depth to its backfield, St. Louis has signed Dukes, who spent time on 
the Redskins' roster earlier this season.  Dukes will probably be the backup 
halfback against the Redskins Monday behind Justin Watson.  Regular backup 
Trung Canidate is out for the season after breaking his right wrist Sunday.   
 

 Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Ramiro Updated 11/16/00 
 Hakim is suffering from a fractured rib but head coach Mike Martz said he 
will play against the Redksins Monday.  This week's matchup could be the 
ultimate test for the Rams' receiving team this week as they go up against 
one of the best secondaries in the league.  Start all of your Rams receivers 
as usual but don't be surprised if some of them struggle.    

 Andrew Glover , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Glover sat out practice Tuesday with a sore back and is listed as probable 
for Sunday's game against the Raiders.  He may catch a lot of passes against 
his former team this week.  The Saints are thin on offense, with Ricky 
Williams and Jake Reed sidelined by injury, so Glover could get a lot of 
balls thrown his way.  The Raiders have been succeptible to tight end routes 
this season.  Denver TEs combined for 125 yards and a TD against them last 
week.  Kansas City TE Tony Gonzalez had nine catches for 134 yards against 
Oakland in Week 10.    

 Chris Hetherington , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Hetherington will make the second start of his five-year career Sunday 
against the Vikings.  Hetherington will be filling in for the injured William 
Floyd who suffered broken ribs last week.  He is not as gifted offensively as 
Floyd though, and will be used primarily for blocking assignments.     

 Kris Mangum , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Mangum exited last Sunday's game after the first quarter and did not return 
due to a sprained shoulder.  Mangum's shoulder has allowed him to be more 
flexible in practice and he appeared to be ready for this week's game at 
Minnesota.  ""We'll see,"" Mangum told the Rock Hill Herald .  ""I tried last 
week. I guess I came back a little early. We'll try again this week and see 
what happens.""  Mangum was supposed to start at tight end in place of the 
injured Wesley Walls but his shoulder ailment has sidelined him as well.  
Rookie Casey Crawford will start at TE once again if Mangum is unable to play 
Sunday.        

 Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Hoover has been working out with the first team this week in preparation for 
a possible start against the Vikings Sunday.  Starter Tim Biakabutuka is 
suffering from turf toe and is questionable for the game at Minnesota.  At 
this point in the season selecting Hoover would be a gamble, even if he does 
start Sunday.  Carolina hasn't run the ball too well this season, averaging 
79.4 yards per game.  It might be safer to use a starting back from another 
team even if the player hasn't been too productive.    

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/16/00 
 Kitna was named the AFC's Offensive Player of the Week yesterday after 
passing for three touchdowns in Seattle's 28-21 victory over Jacksonville.  
His reward?  A return to the bench, in all likelihood.  He is expected to be 
the backup to Brock Huard after the bye in a November 26th game against the 
Denver Broncos.    

 Terrell Owens , WR SF - Fear Updated 11/16/00 
 Owens is still bothered by the turf toe injury that limited his playing time 
in the team's 21-7 win over Kansas City.  Head coach Steve Mariucci is 
seriously considering holding Owens out of this week's game.  Owens still 
leads the NFL in TD receptions with 11 and is third in catches, but the turf 
toe injury could slow him down for the rest of the season.  If he can't play 
Sunday wideout J.J. Stokes would make his second straight start in place of 
him.  

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Leaf may now get the starting nod for this week's game against Denver.  Head 
Coach Mike Riley stated earlier in the week that Jim Harbaugh would be the 
starter, but now says that he will wait a day or two before making a 
decision.  Look elsewhere for a quarterback this week if your roster allows 
it.    

 Jim Harbaugh , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/16/00 
 Harbaugh was named the starter for Sunday's game against the Broncos earlier 
in the week, but Head Coach Mike Riley may now be retracting that statement.  
Ryan Leaf took an equal number of snaps as Harbaugh in practice on Wednesday, 
and may get the nod on Sunday.  Riley said that he plans to wait another day 
or two before announcing a starter.  If at all possible, go with another 
quarterback this week.     

 Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/16/00 
 Jacksonville will be without linebackers Hardy Nickerson and Lonnie Marts, 
and probably without cornerback Aaron Beasley, for Sunday's game in 
Pittsburgh. Nickerson, who missed three games with a hamstring injury and the 
last two recovering from knee surgery, went to California yesterday for a 
second opinion and could be out a few more weeks. Marts is still recovering 
from a groin injury, and Beasley is listed as questionable with a back injury 
but is unlikely to play. Rookie T.J. Slaughter, Erik Storz and Jason Craft 
would get the starts at their respective positions. Pittsburgh has a subpar 
passing game, but its running game, led by Jerome Bettis, could give the 
Jaguars' defense fits come Sunday.    

 Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - The Lie Downs Updated 11/16/00 
 Wheatley is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Saints.  He 
didn't play in Monday night's loss to the Broncos, and will be re-evaluated 
by Head Coach Jon Gruden during practice the rest of the week.  Oakland is 
reportedly talking about signing running back Terry Kirby for this week's 
game, which could be a bad sign if you have Wheatley on your Fantasy 
roster.

Controversy Rages Over Democratic Effort to Suppress Military
Absentee Ballots

 ""...I happen to believe that, the military personal who sent
 their ballots in, should be allowed and should be counted...
 And I think we should look into it,  because we realize that
 when some of those ballots were sent off, many times the
 aircraft or the other vehicle utilized to transport them had
 to get on and they had to leave without the post marks. So I
 think the military should have some latitude in allowing
 those individuals to vote....""
     - Sheila Jackson Lee, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00

 ""...if he wins he is going to be Commander and Chief, I
 think he [Gore] ought to weigh into this and say, 'I really
 want this straightened out because it is only fair and right
 to do that.'""
     - David Gergen, MSNBC's Hardball, 11/18/00

 ""I mean, here we are -- a week ago, we were having the
 groundbreaking for the World War II Memorial, we were all
 praising veterans and servicemen. This week, President
 Clinton is in Vietnam talking about reconciliation, and it
 all involves veterans and all involves active duty service
 personnel. And it seems to me that just in fairness...I
 think the general statement ought to be, 'Let's make every
 effort to count these ballots.'""
     - Bob Dole, NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00

 Tim Russert: ""Will you today, as a representative of the
 Gore campaign, ask every county to relook at those ballots
 that came from armed services people and waive any so-
 called irregularities or technicalities which would
 disqualify them?""

 Senator Joseph Lieberman: ""I don't know that I have that
 authority.  I don't believe I do legally or in any other
 way.""
     - NBC's Meet the Press, 11/19/00

NY Post Editorial
A Desperate Man, A Desperate Act
11/19/00

""How dare you, Al Gore?

""How dare you steal the right to vote from young Americans
serving their country overseas?

""From young soldiers and sailors sworn to defend unto death
the right of Americans to select their leaders - one vote per
person, one vote at a time?

""These are the real questions now facing the nation.

""Everything else is clutter.

""Friday afternoon, Gore strode purposefully to a bank of
microphones outside the vice-presidential mansion in
Washington and said:

""'The American people want to make certain that every vote
counts and that every vote is counted fairly and accurately.'""

""So far, so good.

""Then came word that Gore campaign operatives, armed with a
detailed how-to memo from Democratic lawyer Mark Herron, were
working furiously to trash military absentee ballots -
presumably because these votes were deemed more likely to be
for George W. Bush than for Al Gore.""

Why Hand Counting Is Unfair and Inaccurate


PALM BEACH COUNTY
 ~ Taping chads to ballots.  At least two witnesses noted
   ballots with tape over the chad of hole three, the
   Governor Bush hole.  Teresa LePore, the election
   supervisor, brushed off these mistakes.

 ~ Bush ballots in the Gore pile.  Both Friday night and
   Saturday morning, Bush ballots were found in the Gore pile
   to be counted as Gore votes.  A Democratic observer found
   these.  The Democrat observer later apologized to the
   Republican counterpart, telling him that the stack of
   ballots was different the prior night and had been
   sabotaged.

   Example:
    ~ Jim Williams, a Republican observer, witnessed Democrat
      observers picking up a handful of Gore ballots and
      finding several Bush ballots.  They tried to explain
      why Bush and Gore ballots were mixed together but
      couldn't.
    ~ Instead of pulling out the Bush ballots, Teresa LePore
      stacked all the ballots and put them into a box without
      any explanation to the counters or Palm Beach
      Canvassing Board Chairman Judge Charles Burton.

 ~ Ballots as fans.  The Chairman of the Palm Beach
   Canvassing Board -- Judge Burton -- warned counters to not
   use ballots to fan themselves.

 ~ Elderly counters overworked and burned out.  Counters are
   working from 7AM to 10PM each day -- sometimes even later.
   Counters, many of whom are elderly, are exhausted, angry
   and burned out.  The room is poorly lit.  On Thursday
   night at 1AM, an elderly counter dropped 20 to 50 ballots
   over the floor, creating a huge scene.  Other observers
   stepped on the ballots.

 ~ In two precincts, the result has been so flawed that a
   second manual recount had to be conducted.

 ~ Counters are provided with no instruction and little
   guidance.  Because the Commission is canvassing at the
   same time that people count, counters often roam the room
   with their hands in the air, asking for guidance.

BROWARD COUNTY

 ~ Democrats who are observers one day are ballot inspectors
   for the county the next.  Steven Michaelson of the public
   defender's office admitted in court Friday that Democrats
   are serving as both observers and ballot inspectors.

 ~ Different standards at different tables.  There are
   untrained inspectors at one table telling new inspectors
   at the next table how to conduct the count.  Affidavits
   from Florida residents serving as Republican observers
   state that there is confusion, multiple touching and
   passing of ballots between inspectors, moving precinct
   ballots from one table to the next after the ballots were
   already being counted, etc.

 ~ Conflicting statements.  A Broward County attorney said a
   manual count requires machine error, yet the board
   reversed their earlier decision and began a manual count
   despite no machine problems.  Canvassing Board Chairman
   Judge Lee stated before the initial vote that there was no
   evidence of equipment problems, and that he was surprised
   by the very small number of changes discovered (+4 for
   Gore).

 ~ Falling chad on the floor, on the counting tables, on
   chairs, etc.  There is no reasonable assurance to voters
   that the canvassing board has a system in place to ensure
   the integrity and security of the ballots.  The canvassing
   board ignored a request by Republicans to stop the
   counting until they do so.  Election officials,
   specifically Judge Lee, have simply expressed that the
   chad should be brushed on the floor.  After the first day
   of counting, 78 chad were collected from the ground and
   tables.

 ~ Considering altering the rules to include ""dimpled""
   ballots.  Despite being a quarter of the way through the
   manual recount (approx. 160 precincts), the Broward County
   board is now considering including ""dimpled"" ballots as
   votes.  This has been the centerpiece of the Gore strategy
   to gain additional votes.

DALEY, CHRISTOPHER TRY TO KEEP HILL DEMOCRATS FROM
ABANDONING GORE
11/19/00

""Late last week, Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley and
former Secretary of State Warren Christopher quietly
informed the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate,
Dick Gephardt and Tom Daschle, that if Gore couldn't win on
the hand recounts, the campaign would fold its tent, sources
told TIME. They cautioned that 'the principals aren't there
yet' --Gore and Joe Lieberman weren't yet ready to go along -
'but they will be.' Daley and Christopher would find a way
to get the message to them, TIME reports in its current
issue....

""Gephardt feared that if Florida's secretary of state
Katherine Harris certified a Bush victory, House Democrats
would start abandoning Gore. 'People are saying, Enough is
enough,' a leading Democrat said Friday. 'It's time to be a
good loser.' To buy time, Gephardt organized a Friday-
afternoon conference call for Lieberman and House Democrats.
About 120 phoned in to hear Lieberman's pep talk.""

GORE CAMPAIGN ATTEMPTS PRESSURE TACTICS
11/18/00

""Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the
Democratic lawyer for Palm Beach County's elections
supervisor to try to get the attorney to use his influence
to assure a manual recount would be conducted there, the
lawyer says.

""Christopher, who is leading the Gore campaign's recount
effort in Florida, made the phone call Thursday morning to
Bruce Rogow, who represents elections supervisor Theresa
LePore.

""'It was an effort to have me persuade my client to vote in
favor of starting the manual recount on Thursday. I told him
no. I told him we'd have to wait,'"" Rogow said.

""Rogow said he didn't consider it appropriate for
Christopher or Dershowitz to try to 'persuade me to give
certain advice to my client.'""

UPI Commentary
SLEAZE, SLEAZE, SLEAZE
11/18/00

""Desperate to win the White House, Democrats have used
several strategies to set up a victory at the end of the
day....

""Elector is a position of public trust, so some level of
scrutiny is fair. What is not fair, and is, in fact
sinister, are revelations that Bob Beckel, Democrat solon,
occasional host of Crossfire, and campaign manager for
Walter Mondale's failed 1984 presidential bid, may be
engaged in some of the most vile skullduggery since
Watergate.

""It is an admittedly strong metaphor but frighteningly
appropriate. Since the morning after the election, there
have been rumors afoot that some in the Democrat party might
make serious attempts to switch votes in the Electoral
College.

""If Bush wins Florida, he becomes president by one more
electoral vote than the required 270. If three Republican
electors switch to Gore, the Tennessean gains a majority and
wins the White House.

""According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and
elsewhere, Beckel, who has close ties to Gore recount team
leader Warren Christopher, is engaged in an opposition
research project targeting Republican electors.

""Calling his efforts 'information gathering,' he says he is
working independently of the Gore campaign.

""Bill Daley, the vice president's campaign chairman, has
publicly shied away from any talk of lobbying electors. 'I
think there is a presumption that those members who are
voting, vote based upon the election,"" he has said. 'I
believe the vast majority of them are legally bound. And I
would assume if you're legally bound, you believe you're
morally bound.'

""Anyone in politics knows 'opposition research' is a polite
synonym for digging up dirt. The threat explicit in Beckel's
project is that the lives of electors are going to be
examined and given the same treatment Larry Flynt gave
former Republican Congressman Bob Livingston.

""Beckel told the Journal his procedure is to 'call on mostly
Democrats, but some Republicans too, and ask 'Who are these
electors, and what do you know about them?' That is what
blackmailers do too. Democrats need to call, today, for
Beckel to stop and use heavy hammers to insure that he does.
The presidential election must not be decided based on late
night phones calls to electors asking 'Hey buddy, who was
that woman you went with to Las Vegas last year?' Decency
and liberty demand it.""

San Diego would shift Richey to kickoffs only, after he missed two short field goals Sunday to drop to 21-for-!

 on the season. In that case, you should drop Richey from your roster.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2466&key=1378&""><B>Steve Christie</B></A>, K BUF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/27/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Chargers are expected to sign Christie on Tuesday provided he passes a physical, according to the <I>San Diego Union-Tribune</I>. He would handle the field-goal chores for the remainder of the season, with Wade Richey shifting to kickoffs. If you're a Richey owner and need a kicker, Christie might be worth a pickup based on past history, but don't expect him to be one of the better kickers in the league even if he does get the starting job.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2466&key=1032&""><B>Mark Brunell</B></A>, QB JAC - Not So Nice Machin!

258,"Quarterbacks in the  News:

QB Jake Plummer (Ari) should get the start although he is  still hurting a 
tad with thumb and rib injuries.? He is listed as probable  on the injury 
report.? His backup Dave Brown is questionable with a  shoulder injury.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Jake Plummer  (Ari) looks to start with the sore ribs 
but understand that one good  shot could send him out of the game a la 
Charlie Batch Thursday night.? Be  careful here.

QB Doug Johnson (Atl) has been named the starter for the rest of the  season.
 

QB Trent Dilfer (Bal) is on a bye this week.

QB Rob Johnson  (Buf) is expected to start with sore ribs.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) is making  excellent progress, but he will likely miss 
again this week.? Shane  Matthews is expected to get the start this week.? 
Cade is listed as  questionable with a sore shoulder.? He would probably play 
if Matthews were  to get hurt.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) is expected to return as the starter  despite a sore 
knee.? He practiced on Wednesday.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Scott Mitchell  (Cin)?looked good again in practice 
Friday and is now  probable.? He'll likely get the start which is good news 
for his  teammates.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) did not throw on Wednesday as he nurses  his ribs.? 
The team has not yet named a starter and if he can not go will  look to 
Spergon Wynn to lead there team into the slaughter.? Either way,  look for 
Jacksonville's defense to look good in this contest.
?
*** Saturday Update? Cleveland QBs.? Coach Chris  Palmer will reportedly wait 
until gametime to decide between QBs Doug Pederson  and Spergon Wynn.? What a 
choice.? I'm fairly confident you're not  starting either if you're with me 
still in week 14...

QB Clint Stoerner  was signed by Dallas this week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) is slated to return  the last week of the NFL season at 
the earliest.? Gus Frerotte will start  in his absence.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) was able to practice Tuesday and  is expected to take 
the field with his sore ribs.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC)  practiced on Wednesday, but is still questionable 
whether he will start.?  The coaching staff has yet to name a starter.? I 
rate his chances at 85% to  start.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Elvis Grbac (KC) has been  named the starter.? He 
says the finger feels fine and he's good to  go.

QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) was able to practice Wednesday and now looks  like he

with a sore shoulder and neck.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Jay Fielder (Mia) has looked good  (or at least as 
good as he ever looks) in practice and looks to start  Sunday.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding.? He  appears as 
questionable on the injury report again with a? sore thumb and a  bruised 
ego.? He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays  hurt.? If he can 
not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100% knee)  to take the field.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) practiced again  Friday and looks to 
be ok.? I doubt he'll be 100% for the rest of the  season but he's apparently 
able to manage the pain and limitation from the  thumb.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar  play.?? 
He starts again this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? QB Aaron Brooks (NO) has a shot  at unseating Jeff Blake 
for the 2001 starter in New Orleans according to ESPN's  Chris Mortensen.? So 
besides the obvious playoff situation, he's playing  for stakes that extend 
past this season.? 

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit)  is probable with a sore calf, but expects to 
start.? 

QB Jerome  Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more than that 
to keep him  off the field.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or  two for a more 
durable body.? He appears on the injured list again as  questionable with a 
sore knee.? Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin,? will  start again in his place.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for  the injured Brock Huard.? 
Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney  and was just released from 
the hospital earlier this week.

QB Kurt Warner  (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in practice.? 
He will start  this week.? Trent Green will back him up.
?
*** Saturday Update QB Kurt Warner (StL) will likely be  playing on a less 
than optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking 
at possible snow.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start against the 
Cowboys.? Eric Zeier would play if  Shaun king suffered a set-back.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on  Wednesday and looks to start this week.? 
He is listed as questionable on  the injury report with a hurt thumb.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind  center while Jeff George watches.? I 
doubt we have seen the last of this  controversy.

RB Jamal  Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to  practice briefly on Wednesday and is 
questionable for this week's game.? He  is having troublemaking the hard cuts 
so will likely be ineffective even if he  plays.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Sammy Morris (Buf) isn't looking  much better as we 
near kickoff.? I'm not expecting much of anything from  him this week.

RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game.

RB  Tshimanga?Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He 
is  listed as probable with a sore toe.
?

and has been deactivated for Sunday's game.? Look for RB  Brad Hoover to get 
another start.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Corey Dillon (Cin)? QB Scott  Mitchell (Cin)?looked 
good again in practice Friday and is now  probable.? He'll likely get the 
start which is good news for his  teammates.
*** Saturday Update FB Nick Williams (Cin) ?likely  starts for Clif Groce 
Sunday.

Prentice to ""shoulder"" more of the load this week.

RB Terrell  Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems.? Mike Anderson 
gets the  start again this week.

RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his  sore thumb.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game.? Ahman  Green will get the 
start.

RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and  is expected to be the 
starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury  report with a 
tender hamstring.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Lamar Smith (Mia) continues to look  good in practice 
and should be good to go.

RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is  probable with a sore hamstring.

RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as  questionable on the injury report with bruised 
ribs, but he expects to  play.

ready for the last game of the regular season.? His cast is  expected to come 
off later this week.

RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as  questionable on the injury report with a

few more reps than usual.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Jerald Moore (NO) was upgraded to  probably after a 
good practice Thursday and looks to start.

RB Curtis  Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain.? He is listed as 
probable  with a sore gluteus.? I am guessing he is the butt of many New 
York  jokes.
?

to heal and should be able to make a bigger contribution this  week.? 

RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will  return punts.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and  finger, but his 
ankles are better.? He will play this week.
?
*** Saturday Update? RB Napoleon Kaufman (Oak)  tweaked his hamstring 
Thursday and is?was listed as questionable.? He  did do some work Saturday 
and looks improved. If he is limited,  this?increases the workload Wheatley 
will see and could open the door for  newly signed Terry Kirby.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this  week and he is using the time to 
look for personalized items with his last  name.? We will keep you posted.

RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as  questionable with a sore hamstring.? On a 
team that already has a crowded  backfield with Jermaine Fazande and Terrell 
Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could  be placed on the inactive list this week.

pain.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) practiced  again Friday and 
looks to start Sunday.

today and play this  weekend.
?
*** Saturday Update RB Eddie George (Ten) looked good in  practice Friday and 
will start.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as  questionable with a sore knee.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his  sore forearm.? Look for the Giants 
to attempt to arm-tackle him all day.  
*** Saturday Update RB Stephen Davis (Was) certainly  sounds like he's sure 
to play this week.? Although it has to be noted he  sounded like that last 
week.? While I feel pretty good that he'll play, the  worry here is one good 
shot to the arm could really have an effect.?

?
*** Saturday Update? WR Marcus Robinson (Chi) was  released from the hospital 
after spending a few days keeping an eye on his  back.? He's been downgraded 
to doubtful and I'm really not looking for  anything from this weekend.? He'd 
been struggling with QB Shane Matthews  anyway.? I'd look elsewhere if you

?
*** Saturday Update WR Marty Booker (Chi) looks to see  more playing time 
with Robinson's back troubles.?
?
*** Saturday Update?WR Peter Warrick  (Cin)?? QB Scott Mitchell (Cin)?looked

start which is  good news for his teammates.

WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as  questionable with a sore knee.? He 
did not practice on Wednesday.

WR  Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week.? Johnnie Morton and Herman  
Moore will start in his absence.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more  time on the injury report than Yancey 
Thigpen...well maybe not, but he can't  stay healthy either.? Corey misses 
another game this week as he is  officially listed as out.

WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and  is listed as questionable on 
the injury report.? He says he will be ready  to play though.
?
*** Saturday Update WR E.G. Green (Ind) did not improve  this week and has 
been deactivated.

WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable  with a sore toe.? With Tony Martin now 
healthy, the team will likely rest  OJ so that he can heal for the playoffs.

WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as  questionable on the injury report with a 
sore leg, but he expects to play.
?
*** Saturday Update WR Troy Brown (NE) ?was able to  do some work Saturday 
but still isn't 100%.? He'll probably be the # 3 WR  if he can go Monday.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than  his listing on the injury 
report.? Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing  good enough to hold onto 
the starting jobs even if Jake were to get  healthy.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum.? Joe  Jurevicius will 
start in his place.

WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start  over Laveranues Coles who is out with a 
twisted knee.

WR Courtney Hawkins  (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee, but 
even if he played he would  likely be ineffective.? Hines Ward has been the 
only Pittsburgh receiver to  do anything consistently all year.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to  play, but he keeps talking like he 
will be on the field though.? He was  quoted in the Sacramento Bee as saying 
he is 85% right now.? I am guessing  he is closer to 70%, but he probably 
will play if he can handle the pain from  his turf toe.
*** Saturday Update WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed practice  again Friday and 
looks like he'll be the # 3 WR behind Jerry Rice and J.J.  Stokes.? It's 
tough not to start him as he's always got the potential to  explode but he's 
a big risk.? If you need sure points this week, I'd shy  away from him.? If 
you really need help and you're looking for a home run,  you might take a 
chance on him but just be prepared for the chance he does  little.
?
*** Saturday Update? St. Louis WRs?will likely  be playing on a less than 
optimal field in Carolina Sunday.? Besides the  grass, they're looking at 
possible snow.

WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury.

WR  Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this week.

WR  Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring.? Even 
if  he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor.

WR Albert  Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his 
condition.? He  remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to 
whether he plays.?  The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar so he 
may have limited value  even if he suits up this week.

WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh,  but is expected to play this 
week.?

limited in practice, but expects to play in the  game.

TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this  weekend.? He

?
*** Saturday Update TE Jackie Harris (Dal) did practice  and looks good for 
Sunday.

TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and  just did not catch a pass last 
week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon.? If  Grbac plays, expect him to get 
the ball to Tony again.

TE Hunter Goodwin  (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to play. 

TE Johnny  McWilliams (Min) is now the starter.? John Davis still gets a lot 
of looks  though.

TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow.  

///////////////////////////////

Kickers in the  News:

PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled  quad.

PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week.? But  he has looked 
like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall minutes  before 
game-time.? Now that the Rams are tied for first though, expect the  players 
to start working through the pain.? I rate Wilkins chance to start  at close 
to 90% this week.

	Reforms in India Are Tantalizing,
But Debates Cool Investor Ardor
	By DANNY PEARL 
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
	NEW DELHI, India -- The tumblers of economic reform have slowly but surely 
been turning in India over the past decade, each click resonating through 
this nation of a billion people. Lately the prospect of unlocking its markets 
has seemed a bit brighter -- but not bright enough to impress foreign 
investors.
	Every day, India's financial pages are filled with news of a new opening: a 
plan to sell the government's stake in a big car company, the lifting of 
controls on the textile industry. But the fine print tells another story: 
stubborn hurdles to foreign investment, insistence on public control and open 
battles among ministers that could force Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 
to protect his diverse coalition government rather than take fresh economic 
gambles.
	""The debate over reforms will be endless unless there is a crisis, and there 
is no crisis around the corner,"" says Mahesh Vyas, executive director of the 
Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, a private organization. India is 
still coasting along with economic growth above 6% a year.
	
	Still, there are some worrisome signs. Last month, Standard & Poor's lowered 
its outlook on the Indian rupee because of the darker prospects for economic 
reform. Foreign investment, already a pittance compared with the rest of 
Asia, has slackened recently, and a few big companies, including Enron Corp. 
of Houston and British Telecommunications PLC, are freezing some India 
investments as their focus shifts to more-developed markets. Just 14% of the 
multinational-company executives recently surveyed by AT Kearney said they 
were more likely to invest in India than in China; 56% said the reverse.
	Even critics think Mr. Vajpayee's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which 
one year ago won a mandate to lead its second coalition government, is 
sincere about pushing for further opening of India's statist economy. But 
what government officials call the second generation of reforms -- India's 
Congress Party launched the first in the early 1990s to allow more private 
enterprise -- is meeting stiff domestic resistance. Workers and traditional 
Indian businesses are as scared of competition as ever, and the Congress 
Party, now in the opposition, is playing on those fears. So the government is 
moving in small, often contradictory steps.
	""Their hearts are in the right place,"" says John Band, executive director of 
ASK Raymond James, an affiliate of the American investment bank.
	Here is how the reforms are shaping up in five critical areas.
	Privatization
	India's program of selling off government companies is still mostly talk, but 
much of it could come to fruition in the next few months. While the 
government probably won't meet its target of raising 100 billion rupees 
($2.14 billion) this fiscal year, it is likely India will shed some perennial 
money losers. The first could be Air India and its domestic counterpart, 
Indian Airlines, both of which have attracted expressions of interest from 
foreign airlines including Air France and Singapore Airlines. Divestment 
Minister Arun Shourie, who isn't revealing the full list, said on the first 
day of the World Economic Forum's ""India Economic Summit"" in New Delhi Sunday 
that before proceeding to formal bids, India will reject suitors who could 
pose national-security concerns. India, he said, wants to avoid buyers who 
might shut down the beleaguered airlines and keep the lucrative landing 
rights.
	Job padding is legendary in India, so fear of job losses is real. Bank 
workers fired a warning shot across privatization's bow this month with a 
one-day, midweek strike against government banks. The next day, the 
government announced it was moving forward anyhow, seeking a law that would 
allow it to reduce its stake in public banks below 50%. The move wasn't as 
bold as it seemed, though: The law wouldn't actually contemplate a sale of 
shares and wouldn't allow any single investor to buy more than 1%. Government 
officials pledged to keep the ""public character"" of the banks.
	Supporters of divestment within Mr. Vajpayee's cabinet are few but 
influential. They are concentrating their efforts on a plan to sell the 
government's 50% stake in car maker Maruti Udyog Ltd., a joint venture of 
Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. and India's government. But the cabinet is divided 
over the sale, and Mr. Vajpayee has to keep all the members of his coalition 
happy, including hardline nationalists. This weekend, Mr. Shourie flew to 
Bombay to placate leaders of the radical Shiv Sena party who were upset about 
the prime minister's recent olive branch to separatists in the embattled 
region of Kashmir. One of their demands, he says, was that ""Foreigners should 
not come to acquire control of the Indian economy.""
	Budget pressure may force India to follow through with privatization. The 
World Bank has cited concern that India's budget deficit is a whopping 9.6% 
of its gross domestic product, though much of the red ink can be traced to 
state budgets. Mr. Vyas of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy 
believes the real benefits of privatization will come only when the states 
start to sell off their bus companies and electric utilities -- but ""that's 
not even being talked about.""
	Media
	India has an unrestrained local press but remains suspicious of foreign 
media, especially when they show naked flesh or give their own spin on the 
Kashmir dispute. Technology has brought paradoxes: Indians now get scores of 
channels by cable TV, but only government-controlled TV over regular antenna. 
Foreign magazines and newspapers enter the country freely by the Internet but 
cannot print in India. (The Wall Street Journal is among the papers that have 
made informal efforts to lift the barrier.)
	
	The newly appointed information minister, Sushma Swaraj, a BJP hard-liner, 
this month seemed to be resolving the issues in favor of openness. At her 
prodding, the government suddenly allowed programmers to serve homes directly 
by satellite -- but with some tight restrictions on foreign ownership. 
Equally worrisome was Ms. Swaraj's explanation for the government's decision 
to move forward. Before, she explained, the government had no satellite 
facility in India; now it did, and could cut off broadcasts that offend 
India's programming code. Ms. Swaraj is looking for ways to regulate Web 
sites, too. ""They are bound by this code,"" she said. ""As yet there is no 
complaint. If there is, we can take care of it.""
	Ms. Swaraj started a ""national debate"" over whether to lift the restrictions 
on foreign media; 10 days later ended it with a firm 'no.' But as one door 
closes in India, another often cracks open. Private FM radio is expected to 
make its debut in the spring. The government has also taken steps to help 
film studios get expansion financing, just as Hollywood starts to prowl the 
Hindi film industry for investments.
	Telecommunications
	The Vajpayee government has earned broad kudos for its liberalization of 
telecommunications, and the results may even help build domestic support for 
other reforms. Sales of new telephones have exploded recently as service 
improves. In Bombay, which once had five-year waiting lists for new telephone 
lines, the government's local-phone company, MTNL, now promises, even if it 
doesn't always deliver, hookups in two days. The reason is new competition 
from a private group that includes a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp.
	Telecom investment is vital for India because so much of the country's 
booming software and call-center business relies on fast communications with 
the U.S. The government only recently loosened its control over international 
data gateways, a move that Indians hope will alleviate heavy daytime data 
traffic jams. Idika Solutions, a software company based in Hyderabad, got in 
the habit of downloading files at 6 a.m. to avoid the rush.
	Further reforms should speed up improvements. Next year, Parliament is 
expected to pass a ""convergence"" law, allowing telephone, wireless and data 
services to come under the same license. And the following year government 
phone company VSNL is scheduled to lose its monopoly on long-distance phone 
service.
	Trade
	In theory, India, a member of the World Trade Organization, has no choice but 
to open its borders to foreign products, and so far it is sticking to 
schedule, passing a new patents law and so forth. But rather than investing 
to get ready for free competition, many business families are simply getting 
out of manufacturing. Their worry isn't so much luxury goods from the West, 
which will still face steep duties even after quotas are lifted in the 
spring, but goods like batteries from China and palm oil from Malaysia. The 
government is starting to heed the call for more protection: Last week, it 
raised duties on cooking oil and listed 131 imported products that would have 
to list prices in rupees and register with the Indian bureaucracy.
	The government is also trying to prepare traditional businesses such as 
textiles for a world without quotas. Still, the industry is so thoroughly 
regulated that it is hard to see India's mild reforms having much effect. For 
example, the government just decided to allow big domestic producers to move 
into certain products that were reserved for small companies, but it still 
requires yarn-spinners to produce 10% of their yarn in a form that can be 
used by obsolete hand looms. With certain fabrics, ""if I produce it on a 
power loom, I'm breaking the law,"" says Ramesh Chander Kesar, president of 
the Textile Association India in New Delhi. ""Why should there should be a 
restriction?""
	The main reason is that textiles employs an estimated one of every six Indian 
workers, and the government is loath to throw them out on the street. 
Actually, even when mills close, as many have in central Bombay, mill owners 
often have to keep paying the workers and are restricted in their reuse of 
the land.
	""If we can fire a worker for not working, that will send a powerful signal. 
But there are no votes in it,"" says Gurchuran Das, former Procter & Gamble 
chief in India and occasional adviser to the Congress Party. ""Nobody has the 
courage to explain to the people the way Clinton had the courage to explain 
NAFTA: that jobs will be lost but, in the end, jobs will be created.""
	Some less courageous moves are possible: one idea under discussion in New 
Delhi is to give labor flexibility to companies that are exporting heavily.
	Finance
	India made some big financial reforms in the early '90s, with liberalization 
of interest rates, loosening of currency restrictions and encouragement of 
private banking. The country just needs some more money to prime the system.
	The government is approving new financial products, such as derivatives. The 
big prize, investment bankers say, would be opening of the 
government-controlled mutual fund and pension plans. Right now, they offer 
fixed returns. Private investment companies want the government to let them 
offer Indians more-aggressive private pensions.
	""They are listening,"" says Raju Panjwani, managing director of Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter India. ""Maybe equities are considered risky, but we can't even 
invest in corporate bonds."" The government has a plan under study, called 
""Project Oasis,"" that would allow private pension fund management, with some 
restrictions.
	Another possible source of long-term capital is insurance, something there 
isn't much of in India. The government took a big step last year in allowing 
private insurance companies back into India after nearly 50 years. But as the 
race to start marketing policies begins, only half a dozen companies have 
jumped in. Foreign companies are limited to 26% of each insurance 
partnership. That is a problem, because launching an insurance company can 
take $75 million, and ""there are not that many Indian companies that can 
support 74% of that kind of a number,"" says Gary Benanav, chief executive of 
New York Life Insurance Co.'s international unit. The company, which is 
launching its India insurance venture in partnership with an Indian 
conglomerate, estimates the Indian market could support 50 insurance 
competitors.
	""They've made a decision which I don't think in the long run is in the best 
interests of India, though I understand it. The colonial era has left a few 
wounds here,"" Mr. Benanav says.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Jon Kitna , QB SEA - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Brock Huard the starter for this week's 
game against the Broncos, relegating Kitna to the Seattle bench.  Kitna was 
named the AFC's Player of the Week two weeks ago, but it obviously wasn't 
enough to keep the starting job.    

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Grbac injured the index finger on his throwing hand against the Bills, but 
the injury won't likely keep him from playing this week against the 
Chargers.  ""We'll see Wednesday or Thursday,"" said Head Coach Gunther 
Cunningham, ""but from what the doctors told me, I think the opportunity's 
there for him to play.""    

 Broncos , DT DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Ray Crockett will miss at least four games with a torn 
hamstring.  The injury occurred on the final play of the third quarter while 
Crockett was chasing down Chargers' wideout Jeff Graham.  Nine-year veteran 
Jimmy Spencer will take over Crockett's position until he returns.    

 Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith looks likely to get the start when the Bengals play Pittsburgh next 
Sunday. Scott Mitchell, who started Sunday's game against New England, is 
listed as doubtful with a sprained left knee he suffered in that game. Just 
because Smith is starting doesn't mean you should do the same - he needs to 
get in gear before he'll have any Fantasy value.  

 Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Davis will undergo another MRI this week on his injured leg and is having an 
expert in San Francisco cross-check the results.  At this point, the Broncos 
are preparing for this week's game against Seattle as if Davis were 
unavailable.  If you have Davis' backup, Mike Anderson, it seems like a good 
idea to include him in your starting lineup this week.     

 Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The status of the Jets' running back for this week's game against the Bears 
is still uncertain.  Martin left Sunday's game in Miami with what was 
described as a strained back, and never returned to the field.  He had an 
examination by team doctors yesterday, and had some X-rays taken as well.  
The club hasn't released any information on the resluts of the exam.  If 
Martin is on your Fantasy squad, your best bet is to stay tuned as the week 
progresses.     

 Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 According to New York Newsday , Coles will be unable to play in this week's 
game against the Bears.  He was hit on the knee during the opening kickoff of 
the second half in Sunday's win over the Dolphins.  If Coles is an integral 
part of your roster, look to pick up Dedric Ward, who should get more playing 
time in Coles' absence.    

 Billy Joe Tolliver , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints re-signed Tolliver yesterday, after the 10-year veteran had been 
cut by the team during training camp. With Jeff Blake out for the season, New 
Orleans needed a No. 3 quarterback, so Tolliver will fill that role behind 
starter Aaron Brooks and backup Jake Delhomme.  

 Jeff Blake , QB NO - Fear Updated 11/21/00 
 The Saints placed Blake on injured reserve yesterday, officially ending his 
season. He will have surgery on his fractured and dislocated right foot as 
soon as the swelling subsides and the extent of the damage is determined. 
Blake will be replaced by Aaron Brooks.  

 Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Smith's status is still not certain, but he does expect to return for 
Sunday's game against the Colts.  He left last week's game against the Jets 
after aggravating his strained right hamstring, an injury which he sustained 
a week earlier against the Chargers.  Smith has been one of the year's 
biggest Fantasy sleepers, and has become an everyday starter for those 
Fantasy owners who were lucky enough to grab him.  If he does in fact play 
this week, be sure to include him in your starting lineup.    

 Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/21/00 
 Although his status is still up in the air, Fiedler expects that he will be 
ready to play in Sunday's AFC showdown against the Colts.  Fiedler was 
injured on the first play of the Jets' game when linebacker Mo Lewis drove 
his head and shoulder into the turf. He suffered a slightly seperated 
throwing shoulder and developed muscle spasms in his back.  Fielder isn't one 
of the better options in the Fantasy game, so avoid playing him this week 
even if he does start.  

 Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/21/00 
 The Redskins should know by Thursday if Johnson can re-assume his starting 
job for this week's showdown against the Eagles.  He has started to test his 
injured left knee with some light dropbacks and will likely push the knee 
harder during practice on Wednesday and Thursday.    

 Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 With the injury to Ike Hilliard, Jurevicius will likely start this week's 
game at Arizona.  With only 12 receptions on the entire season, Jurevicius 
isn't a solid Fantasy option, so don't pick him up unless your roster is 
really straped for receivers.    

 Bills , DT BUF - Ramiro Updated 11/21/00 
 Cornerback Antoine Winfield has been lost for the rest of the season with a 
torn labrum in his right shoulder.  He suffered the injury three weeks ago 
against New England. Winfield has tried to play through the pain, but has 
aggravated the injury in each of Buffalo's last two games.  Head Coach Wade 
Phillips announced to the media that Winfield will have surgery on 
Wednesday.  His loss will hurt Buffalo's secondary, but they remain a solid 
defense in the world of Fantasy.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 Head Coach Mike Holmgren has named Huard the starter for this week's game 
against the Broncos.  Huard took all of the snaps with the first team offense 
after a bye week, and is ready to make his first start since sustaining a 
concussion on Oct. 22 in Oakland.  Huard isn't considered a solid Fantasy 
option, so don't start him until he shows some signs that he is ready to 
produce.    

 Cardinals , DT ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/00 
 The Arizona defense came out of Sunday's loss to the Eagles extremely banged 
up.  Linebacker Zach Walz, who just recently returned from knee surgery, is 
out with a broken left leg.  Defensive tackle Mark Smith hurt his shoulder 
and had his arm in a sling on Monday.  Safety Kwamie Lassiter was also 
injured in the game, suffering a sprained knee. With all of these injuries on 
defense, it's probably a good idea to keep the Cardinals' defense on the 
bench this week.      

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Alstott probably will miss the rest of the regular season after spraining 
his left knee in Tampa Bay's 13-10 loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday.  The 
Bucs described Alstott's injury as a third-degree sprain of the medial 
collateral ligament and said he is expected to be sidelined six to eight 
weeks.  Charles Kirby, a third-year pro in his first season with Tampa Bay, 
will replace Alstott.     

 Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 Toomer posted a great day for his Fantasy owners against Detroit, catching 
eight passes for 108 yards in the Giants' 31-21 loss. He may have a more 
difficult time next week against Arizona's All-Pro cornerback Aeneas 
Williams, so start him at your own discretion.      

 Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Barber caught eight passes and compiled 129 yards of total offense in 
Sunday's loss to the Lions.  Look for Barber to get a number of looks out of 
the backfield this week against Arizona, as the Giants attempt to compensate 
for the loss of wide receiver Ike Hilliard.   

 Kerry Collins , QB NYG - The Rounders Updated 11/20/00 
 Collins threw a season-high 51 passes on Sunday, but it wasn't enough to 
tame the Lions.  Collins has been a more productive Fantasy option of late, 
throwing eight touchdown passes in his last three games. He may run into a 
road block this week against the Cardinals, however, especially if Ike 
Hilliard is unable to play.  Without Hilliard, Arizona can put All-Pro 
cornerback Aeneas Williams on Amani Toomer, leaving Tiki Barber and Pete 
Mitchell as Collins' only real receiving options. If you can find a better 
quarterback than Collins this week, it might be a good idea to use 
him.           

 James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 11/20/00 
 McKnight caught four passes for 50 yards in Sunday's loss at Baltimore.  He 
could, however, be a good sleeper pick this week against the Vikings.  
Minnesota's secondary can be beaten downfield, so look for McKnight to try 
and break a few long ones in an effort to spark a banged up Dallas offense.   
 

 Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Smith had his second consecutive subpar performance on Sunday against the 
Ravens, rushing for only 48 yards on eleven carries. He has been held to only 
64 yards rushing in the past two weeks, which is significant when you 
consider that Smith is one of the league's greatest running backs of 
all-time.  The combination of a short week and the loss of center Mark 
Stepnoski will hurt Smith's production, so it might be a good idea to sit him 
this week if your roster allows it.    

 Troy Aikman , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 Aikman found out just how good the Ravens' defense is on Sunday.  He 
completed just 19-of-33 passes for 138 yards and three interceptions in 
Dallas' 27-0 loss in Baltimore. Aikman faces a Minnesota defense on 
Thanksgiving that has been solid in recent weeks, so don't expect any kind of 
Fantasy explosion from the Cowboys' aging quarterback.      

 Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/20/00 
 Hilliard, who left Sunday's game against the Lions with a bruised sternum 
and lung, will remain in the hospital for the next two days and will likely 
miss this Sunday's game against Arizona. Look for Joe Jurevicius to start in 
Hilliard's place, but don't expect him to produce the same type of numbers 
that Hilliard has posted.     

 Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Anderson ran 17 times for 76 yards against the 49ers Sunday.  Although he 
has become more confident in putting weight on his bad knee, you probably 
won't see Anderson have a big game until next season.  Don't expect things to 
get any better for Anderson next week when he goes up against a tough Raiders 
run defense.     

 Johnnie Morton , WR DET - The Snake Pit Updated 11/20/00 
 Morton awakened from his slumber to catch six passes for  78 yards against 
the Giants Sunday.  He only had one catch in each of the Lions last three 
games.  Morton will probably struggle once again this Thursday when the Lions 
face a formidable Patriots secondary.     

 Brett Favre , QB GB - Mean Machine Updated 11/20/00 
 While completing 23-of-36 passes, Favre threw for 301  yards with two 
touchdowns and one interception.  He showed extreme toughness Sunday, 
starting the game despite suffering a sprained foot a week earlier.  He 
should be just as effective next week against a docile Panthers pass rush.  
Carolina won't put too much pressure on Favre, allowing him to dissect the 
secondary, and pile up Fantasy points.     

 Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Meximullets Updated 11/20/00 
 The Packers' wideout had what might have been his best game of the season 
against the Colts Sunday, racking up 155 yards on eight catches.  He won't 
continue to post numbers like this, but look for Schroeder to have some 
success against the Panthers this Sunday.     

 Ahman Green , RB GB - Ramiro Updated 11/20/00 
 Green ran for a career-high 153 yards on 24 carries Sunday against the 
Colts.  His success should continue in upcomings games against the weak run 
defenses of the Panthers, Bears, and Lions.   

 Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/20/00 
 In relief of Blake, the little-used Brooks completed 14-of-22 passes for 187 
yards, with two touchdowns and one  interception.  Owners of Jeff Blake may 
want to consider picking up Brooks.  It will take some time for Brooks to get 
used to playing in the NFL, but he could put up solid numbers in the final 
games of the season as the Saints face a plethora of weak pass defenses.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Chris Warren , RB PHI - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Warren arrived in Philadelphia on Friday, and practiced with the Eagles on 
Saturday. Although he hasn't had a lot of time to get familiar with the 
offensive scheme, he could get some action against Cleveland on Sunday. We 
wouldn't recommend starting him during the Fantasy playoffs this week, 
however.  

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/10/00 
 Although Watters didn't practice all week because of a bad case of turf toe, 
Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren said he will start Sunday against Denver. Watters 
is not on the injury report and medical reports say the toe is fine.  

 Rian Lindell , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Lindell is a sleeper pick at kicker this week. Seattle should roll up good 
numbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the 
year.   

 Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense 
is one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a 
chance to shine this week.   

 Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 
 Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced 
Denver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith 
embarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  

 John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard 
time moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  

 Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San 
Diego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  

 Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's 
defense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more 
decorated backs all season long.   

 Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more 
problems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around 
all day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no 
cirumstances should you start him.    

 Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the 
overworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and 
speedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   

 Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 
 Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. 
Charles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might 
be able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  

 Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be 
too much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key 
third-down target.  

 Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. 
The Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets 
in the red zone.   

 Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him 
in coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  

 Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. 
Tyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may 
need to use Crockett often against the Jets.   

 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 
 Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week. Look for him to 
pick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim 
Brown.   

 Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of 
trouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than 
200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   

 Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 
 The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against 
the Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven 
and the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on 
Steve Beuerlein.  

 Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The 
Kansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few 
chances to kick against Carolina.  

 Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an 
accomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help 
many Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  

 Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 
 Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar 
TE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not 
be able to contain him over the middle.  

 Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. 
CBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep 
routes.  

 Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He 
should be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his 
injured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage 
to Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as 
a strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants 
defense.  

 Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 
 Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will 
have no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  

 Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 
 Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform 
well against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the 
middle.     

 Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 
 Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good 
numbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 
 Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to 
play Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from 
scrimmage and scored a touchdown.  

 Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 
 Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last 
week. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely 
risky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore 
defense.  

 Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 
 Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that 
spot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used 
in short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas 
City RBs.

276,"College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31.
""The end zones were confusing,"" says Slocum.  ""I'm sure that some of the
touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours. We
were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points.  There's no way we lost this one.  A&M demands a
recount.""

Oklahoma officials are calling this ""outrageous"".  ""They agreed to the size,

shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,"" replies OU
coach Bob Stoops.  ""If they had a problem with them, they should have said
so before we started.  You don't get to keep playing until you're happy
with the outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five
points many times.""

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well
as that darn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.
""We are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the
winner of the game,"" says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end  zones

were used.  ""They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,""

says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside
bearing signs such as, ""A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!""  Students'
thoughts echoed their signs.  ""All we want is a fair total of the points
before we declare a winner,"" says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.
""We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a
winner.""

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite
the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point.  At about 2:30 pm, with
the
game still too close to call, ABC had to back off its prediction.

College Football analyst Brent Musburger made the call.  ""We felt that with
a number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies,
we were certain A&M would carry this game.  We may have been premature in
our prediction.""

284,"News galore....let's jump into it


Quarterbacks in the News:

QB Chris Chandler (Atl) is doubtful with a concussion. He has not
practiced all week. QB Danny Kanell will start in his place.

QB Rob Johnson (Buf) is expected to sit another week with a sore
shoulder. Doug Flutie gets the start again.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) still cannot throw and will not play this week.
Jim Miller starts in his absence.

QB Doug Pederson (Cle) will start this week, but the coaches may give
him the quick hook should he struggle.

QB Troy Aikman (Dal) practiced with the first team Thursday and is
expected to start this week. If he cannot go because of his back,
Cliff Stoerner would start. Randall Cunningham is also hurt with a
sore knee and has not practiced.

QB Brian Griese (Den) continues to play through his ailments. This
week will be no different.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) has recovered from his concussion and is
expected to start this week.

QB Elvis Grbac (KC) is expected to play with a sore elbow. Hint to
team, Maybe try throwing for less than 500 yards?

QB Daunte Culpepper (Min) does not appear on the injury report, but
has a sore knee. He is expected to start this week.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) was seen wearing a splint and did not practice
on Wednesday. The team is being very mum whether he will play or not.
John Friesz would get the start in his absence, but the team could
also use Michael Bishop if Friesz struggles. This is likely a
situation you should avoid if at all possible.

QB Vinny Testaverde (NYJ) still has a stiff neck, but has played
through it the last two weeks. Expect the same this week.

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) gets the start this week.

QB Jim Harbaugh (SD) is listed as questionable, but he will not
start. The team named Moses Moreno the starter earlier in the week.

QB Brock Huard (Sea) is not fully over his concussion. He is expected
to sit this week. Jon Kitna will get the start.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) is out for another 2-3 weeks.

QB Shaun King (TB) has tonsilitis, but is expected to play on Sunday.
He practiced on Thursday.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) will likely be added today to the injury report
with a sore back. He expects to play on Sunday though.

QB Brad Johnson (Was) is on a bye this week and will not play.

QB Jeff George (Was) is on a bye this week and will not play.

RB Bob Christian (Atl) is questionable with a sore knee. He did not
practice on Thursday.

RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is listed as questionable with a sore toe.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) returned to practice and will play this week.

RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) rested Wednesday, but is expected to
play with his sore knee.

carries this week.

RB Shyrone Stith (Jac) missed Wednesday's practice, but he
expects to
play if needed.

RB Joe Montgomery (NYG) is listed as questionable and did not
practice Wednesday. With Thunder and lightning healthy, he will
likely be rested to get healthier.

RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) is fine, but the Jets continue to list 100
players on the injury report. He will start on Sunday.

RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) has two sprained ankles and was held out of
practice on Wednesday. He played through the pain last week, but
looks as if he is in worse shape this week. He will likely be a game-
time decision which is ugly since he plays on Monday Night. We will
keep you posted regarding any breaking news regarding his status.

RB Amp Lee (Phi) is expected to play with a sore back.

RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out for the next three weeks.

RB Jerome Bettis (Pit) skipped Wednesday's practice, but is

hopeful
of playing on Sunday.

practiced.

RB Robert Holcombe (StL) has a sore hamstring, but expects to play.
He is listed as questionable on the injury report.

wrist.

RB Larry Centers (Was) is on a bye this week and will not play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Wide Receivers in the News:

WR David Boston (Ari) has a sore hamstring, but is expected to play.

WR Tim Dwight (Atl) will be downgraded to questionable on

WR Travis Taylor (Bal) was placed on injured reserve and is lost for
the year.

WR Kevin Drake was signed by Buffalo.

WR Muhsin Muhammad (Car) is expected to play with his sore hamstring.

WR David Patten (Cle) has not practiced and is doubtful this week.

WR Chris Cole (Den) is expected to play with a sore elbow.

expected
to play this week.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) is back on the injury report with a quad
strain. He has not practiced and is doubtful for this week.

WR Terrence Wilkins (Ind) was criticized heavily by the coach to the
media this week. Coach Mora has stated that E.G. Green will see more
playing time this week.

WR Marvin Harrison (Ind) has practiced with his stiff neck and will
play this week.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac) used the bye week to get healthier. He is
expected to play this week.

WR Tony Martin (Mia) is expected to play this week with a sore foot.
He will not start though. Oronde Gadsden and Leslie Shepherd will be
the starters.

WR Terry Glenn (NE) signed a six year contract extension. ""She""
should be there for many years to come.

WR Ron Dixon (NYG) did not practice Wednesday and will likely be
rested to get healthier.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ) is expected to play with his sore shoulder.

WR Laveranues Coles (NYJ) will also return kickoffs after the team
cut Kevin Williams.

WR Charles Johnson (Phi) is expected to play with a sore shoulder.

WR Sean Dawkins (Sea) was held out of practice Wednesday and Thursday
with a sore quadricep. He is listed as questionable on the injury
report.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) missed Wednesday's and Thursday's
practices
with a very tender toe. He's listed as questionable and could be
a
game-time decision. Tai Streets and JJ Stokes will see extra action
if Owens can not go.

WR Derrick Mason (Ten) is the least hurt of all the receivers and
will start on Sunday. He is battling a sore back and ankle. He
practiced on Thursday.

WR Chris Sanders (Ten) is listed as questionable on the injury
report, but expects to start with his sore back and ribs. He
practiced on Thursday.

WR Yancey Thigpen (Ten) shockingly appears on the injury report as
questionable this week. For those that have followed his career, this
usually means he will not play.

WR Carl Pickens (Ten) is still bothered by a hamstring and was not
able to practice at full speed. He is not likely to make much of an
impact this week.

WR Kenny Shedd (FA) was signed by Washington.

//////////////////////////////////////

Tight Ends in the News:

TE Chris Gedney (Ari) has sore ribs, but is expected to play. He
practiced on Wednesday and Thursday.

TE Derek Brown signed with Arizona.

TE Kris Mangum (Car) will likely be held out one more week with his
ailing shoulder. Casey Crawford gets the start at tight end now that
Wesley Walls is lost for the year.

TE Eric Bjornson (NE) has lost his starting job to Rod Rutledge.

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ) is expected to play with his sore knee.

TE Freddie Jones (SD) has turf toe, but is expected to play through
the pain.

TE Stephen Alexander (Was) is on a bye this week and will not play.

//////////////////////////////////////

Kickers in the News:

PK Matt Stover (Bal) has a sore finger, but it will not keep him from
kicking on Sunday.

PK Mike Vanderjagt (Ind) inked a five year contract extension.

PK Sebastian Janikowski (Oak) left the hospital so he may go on
Monday. He is listed as questionable, but has not practiced. The
Raiders have looked at Brett Conway and Chris Boniol, but have not
signed either one. We will watch this one close for you Friday and
Saturday.

PK Jeff Wilkens (StL) is expected to handle FGs this week. John Hall
was signed earlier in the week and will perform kickoffs and is the
backup to Jeff if he can't kick.

PK Eddie Murray (FA) was signed by Washington.

PK Scott Bentley (FA) was signed by Washington.

PK Kris Heppner (Was) was released after his several miscues cost the
team a victory this past week.

 Player Updates?NFL Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Mike Alstott , RB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00 
 Alstott could be back in practice on Thursday, a full two weeks ahead of 
schedule in his return from a sprained knee. If all goes well, he could play 
in the Monday night game against St. Louis, or at worst, the season finale 
against Green Bay on December 24. It's probably best to keep Alstott on your 
bench during the Fantasy playoffs, although there's an outside shot he could 
make an impact during the final game if he gets into the swing of things 
quickly.  

 Chad Morton , RB NO - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Morton is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Atlanta with a 
separated shoulder, although he was able to play with a shoulder injury last 
Sunday. We don't recommend him for your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Jerald Moore , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Head Coach Jim Haslett says he hopes to re-sign Moore, who was placed on 
waivers on Saturday. Moore became expendable with the addition of veteran 
Terry Allen, and won't have any Fantasy value even if he returns.  

 Matt Hatchette , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Hatchette injured the oblique muscle above his hip during last Sunday's game 
against St. Louis. He's listed as day to day, but is expected to play Sunday 
against Green Bay. He's not someone who will help your Fantasy team much, 
though.  

 Chris Walsh , WR MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Walsh is unlikely to play Sunday against Green Bay after he underwent 
surgery on Tuesday on a broken bone in his left cheek. He suffered the injury 
during last Sunday's game against St. Louis but finished the game. Walsh has 
been valuable to the Vikings on special teams and as the No. 4 receiver, but 
he's not a viable Fantasy option.  

 Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00 
 The Jaguars will need to evaluate Taylor's sprained left knee during 
practice this week before determining his status for Sunday's game against 
Cincinnati. He suffered the injury during the third quarter of last Sunday's 
game, which was his seventh straight with at least 100 rushing yards. 
Hopefully Taylor will be able to play, as he's among the best options at 
running back during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Northcutt will miss Cleveland's final game of the season Sunday against 
Tennessee due to a sprained ankle. Believe it or not, this likely hurts the 
Browns' quarterbacking situation most, as he was rotating in that slot last 
Sunday against Philadelphia. It's best to avoid any Cleveland players at this 
stage of the Fantasy season.  

 Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 12/12/00 
 Enis, who missed last Sunday's game against New England due to a reaction to 
an over-the-counter flu medicine, was feeling better Monday. Still, his 
status for Sunday's game against San Francisco is unknown, so it's best to 
keep him on your bench this week.  

 Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bears Coach Dick Jauron may give Matthews the start at quarterback on Sunday 
against San Francisco, instead of giving Cade McNown the final two starts. 
One possible reason for that may be that Matthews aggravated an injury when 
he was rushed back last season, and Jauron didn't want the same to happen to 
McNown. We don't recommend either quarterback this week, despite him facing 
the weak Niners' pass defense.   

 Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - Baja Updated 12/12/00 
 Biakabutuka, who has missed four games with turf toe, may be able to 
practice on Wednesday. Even if he is able to play Sunday against San Diego, 
we wouldn't recommend Biakabutuka the remainder of the season.  

 Steve Beuerlein , QB CAR - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Although he's most likely the quarterback for 2001, Beuerlein might be 
benched for backup Jeff Lewis for part of Carolina's final two games. Nothing 
is worse than a part-time quarterback for your Fantasy playoffs, so steer 
clear of both players if at all possible.  

 Jeff Lewis , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Coach George Seifert says that he may give Lewis some playing time over the 
final two games, although he has endorsed Steve Beuerlein as the starter for 
2001. Lewis has a high cost against the cap, so the Panthers need to 
determine soon whether he's the quarterback of the future. On the other hand, 
Beuerlein has the third-longest consecutive-starts streak in the league at QB 
and may not want to end it. Lewis isn't someone we'd recommend during your 
Fantasy playoffs, whether he starts or not.  

 Jammi German , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 German was unable to practice Monday, and may be placed on injured reserve 
on Tuesday with a badly sprained left ankle. He has no Fantasy value.  

 Bills , DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' defense has been ravaged by injuries this season, and it 
certainly showed on Monday night. Although Indianapolis did score two 
defensive touchdowns in the game, Buffalo's D still gave up 30 points to 
Indy. Once a solid defensive unit, the Bills are now just a shell of their 
former selves and shouldn't be considered a starting defensive squad on your 
Fantasy team.   

 Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/12/00 
 Christie made up for his scoreless performance last week with two field 
goals on Monday night, including a 46-yard boot in the second quarter. He is 
one of the best placekickers in the league, and should be considered a weekly 
starter on your Fantasy team.   

 Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 The Bills' young wideout has only 12 receptions in his last six games and 
hasn't seen the end zone since Week Three against the Jets. What little 
Fantasy value he may have had early in the season is all but gone now.   

 Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Vanderjagt converted on all three of his field goal attempts in Monday 
night's win over Buffalo. He is one of the NFL's most accurate kickers, 
missing only two field goals the entire season. Starting Vanderjagt this week 
is a good idea against a tough Miami defesne that doesn't allow many 
touchdowns.   

 Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Pollard hasn't had more than two catches in any game in the last four weeks, 
and hasn't scored a touchdown since Week Five. Translation: Avoid starting 
Pollard at all costs for the duration of your Fantasy season.   

 Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 With only seven receptions in the last four weeks, including only one on 
Monday night, Dilger has become a Fantasy afterthought. Avoid starting him if 
your roster allows it.  

 Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00 
 Pathon caught three passes for 31 yards on Monday night against the Bills. 
At this point in the season, Pathon has no Fantasy value.   

 Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Moulds had another sub-par performance on Monday night, catching only two 
passes for 47 yards in the Bills' loss to Indianapolis. In the last two 
weeks, Moulds has caught only four balls for 58 yards and no touchdowns. 
Fantasy owners who have Moulds should continue starting him in the Fantasy 
playoffs and hope that he can break out of this semi-slump.    

 Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - The Klap Updated 12/12/00 
 Wilkins came back down to earth after last week's 109-yard, one touchdown 
performance against the Jets, catching only two passes for 37 yards on Monday 
night. Wilkins has been far more effective on special teams than as a 
receiver in recent weeks, so don't expect much production in the final two 
weeks of the season.    

 Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 12/12/00 
 To the disbelief of many Fantasy owners, Harrison was held in check in 
Monday night's game with the Bills. He caught only two passes for 27 yards 
against what was an injury-depleted Buffalo secondary - a performance which 
may have helped keep some owners from moving on in their playoffs. If you 
were lucky enough to advance, Harrison is still a must start, even against 
the Colts' next opponent, the Miami Dolphins. In the team's first meeting, 
Harrison scorched the Fish for 74 yards receiving and two scores.     

 Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/12/00 
 Price had his best performance of the season on Monday night, catching four 
passes for 93 yards and a touchdown in Buffalo's loss to the Colts. These 
were the types of numbers that Fantasy owners were expecting all season from 
Price, but they are still too little, too late to consider him for your 
starting lineup.   

 Sammy Morris , RB BUF - Top Dogs Updated 12/12/00 
 Morris returned to limited duty on Monday night after missing two games with 
an ankle injury. He accounted for 34 yards of total offense and a touchdown 
in the Bills' 44-20 loss. Morris will likely be splitting time with Shawn 
Bryson in the backfield, so it's a good idea to avoid starting either of 
Buffalo's tailbacks at this point.  

 Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Bryson got the majority of the carries against the Colts on Monday night, 
rushing the ball 15 times for 45 yards.  His main production, however, came 
through the air, where he caught six passes for 75 yards. Bryson's 120 yards 
of total offense is impressive, but he still isn't a viable option for 
Fantasy owners at this point in the season.    

 Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/12/00 
 ""The Edge"" had a terrific Fantasy performance on Monday night, compiling 132 
yards of total offense and three touchdowns in the Colts' big win over 
Buffalo. James will face a Miami squad that gave up 118 yards rushing to him 
back in Week 12, but also kept him out of the end zone. When it comes really 
comes down to it, the Colts could be facing the 1985 Bears' defense and it 
wouldn't matter - James is a must start for the duration of the Fantasy 
playoffs.  

 Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/12/00 
 Manning had a very un-Peyton like performance on Monday night, completing 
13-of-24 passes for only 132 yards and no touchdowns in the Colts' 44-20 win. 
It was the first time this season that Manning was held with out at least one 
touchdown pass in a game. If your team survived Manning's poor Fantasy 
performance, you may not like his team's next opponent - Miami. The Dolphins 
have two of the best corners in the game in Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison, 
so it isn't out of the question for Manning to have another sub-par 
performance. At this point in the season, it is a good idea to stick with the 
former Vols star and hope he can have a more typical Peyton Manning day.    

 Brock Huard , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Huard is expected to miss another game while recovering from a bruised 
kidney this week. Jon Kitna will start again and might make several turnovers 
against an opportunistic Oakland defense.  

 Randy Jordan , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 
 Jordan has a turf toe injury and will miss some practice time this week. He 
will play at Seattle but might be used sparingly.

			Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word
			
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Andy Katz
	ESPN.com
	
	With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere 
between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential 
of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.
	
	NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking 
heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft 
camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of 
talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several 
projections we'll have on ESPN.com.
	
	A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but 
could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing 
in Chicago.
	
	The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a 
chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center 
Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason 
Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard 
Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point 
guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State 
junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey 
forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.
	
	Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next 
month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must 
decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until 
June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and 
Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what 
happens.
	
	ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock 
draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.
	
	
	
	
	Chris Mihm
	
	Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
	
	1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and 
could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets 
could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next 
season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.
	
	2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be 
getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player 
in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. 
Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the 
Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.
	
	3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have 
already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward 
(which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him 
defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to 
return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door 
open for a return.
	
	4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center 
for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next 
in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better 
offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.
	
	5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles 
but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic 
an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last 
season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.
	
	6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on 
Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better 
scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta 
wants a small forward over a big guard.
	
	7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can 
package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be 
solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy 
McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would 
have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.
	
	8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the 
third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, 
but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for 
size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are 
split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.
	
	9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go 
higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce 
during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, 
DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over 
a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.
	
	10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): 
The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their 
three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has 
scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without 
feeling pressured to play him next season.
	
	11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 
11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but 
can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from 
Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much 
different.
	
	12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don 
Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the 
Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a 
foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts 
and in Chicago -- if he shows.
	
	13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to 
take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough 
to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the 
point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching 
because of his leadership and toughness.
	
	14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't 
let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next 
to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go 
higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.
	
	15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power 
forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. 
None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a 
rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the 
Pacers.
	
	16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a 
backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under 
any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind 
Cleaves. 
	
	17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, 
he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit 
all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the 
Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement 
Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs. 
	
	18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers 
need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that 
some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of 
being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.
	
	19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up 
into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will 
catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of 
his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The 
Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.
	
	20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have 
already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off 
the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first 
round, regardless of where he's being picked.
	
	21. Toronto -- Craig ""Speedy"" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have 
already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If 
Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural 
pick for the Raptors.
	
	22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some 
heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical 
players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. 
Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.
	
	23. Utah -- Hanno M""tt""l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with 
picking M""tt""l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end 
up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small 
forward. If M""tt""l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first 
round.
	
	24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point 
guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most 
intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard 
positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the 
Bulls some versatility on the floor.
	
	25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another 
big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor 
together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns 
have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.
	
	26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism 
and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. 
Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could 
still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.
	
	27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave 
reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early 
without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers 
have a history of going younger in the draft.
	
	28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers 
don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to 
jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking 
skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many 
miles left in his legs.
	
	29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's 
where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or 
Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the 
Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.

Harassment Prevention Training

This training is mandatory for all Enron employees employed since the last 
seminar was conducted  in late 1998 or early 1999.  Those who have already 
attended Enron harassment avoidance training will be offered a refresher 
course in avoiding and preventing harassment.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training.  

The dates and times available for the sessions are:


 Friday, Feb 23; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15
  Monday Mar 5; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00

All training sessions will be held in the LaSalle Room at the DoubleTree 
Hotel.
There is a $50 charge for each attendee in the training session."

Tuesday, April 10, 2001 ? ?

 
 

Dear continental.com customer,



We're Changing To Serve You Better
This Thursday evening April 12th 2001, we are launching a new version of our 
web reservations system, eService Online.  This marks the start of an 
exciting new beginning as the reservations platform is 100% provided by 
Continental.

We're making this change because our current product, while good, will not 
provide us with the flexibility in the future to offer the features that will 
make travel arranging easier and to tailor the online Continental experience 
for you.


Here's What You Need To Know:

Your Profile
Your profile information, including your username (dbaughm) and password, has 
been transferred to the new version of eService Online.  To protect your 
personal information, credit card information has not been transferred.  You 
will need to update your profile.

Your Itineraries
Information on your reservations created before April 12th will not be saved. 
If you want to keep a copy for your records, you will need to print them 
prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th.  This change does not affect the status of any 
previous reservations and tickets, but you can not view them in the new 
eService Online.  

Signing In
To enhance security, you will have to sign in for each transaction session to 
reserve and purchase flights.  This means you will have to use your password 
each time.  To have your password e-mailed to you click here.  You are 
strongly encouraged to sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging 
process. 

24 Hour Hold Option
To prepare for this Thursday's release we will be turning off the ""Hold for 
24 hours"" option.  The ""Hold"" option will not be available between April 10 
and April 12.


Here Are Some of the Changes

More eTicketing
The new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets 
(eTickets).  We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by 
Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West 
Airlines (CO2000-2349). 

Aircraft Seat Maps
We rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the 
seat selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating. 

Pricing 
The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on your 
selection of either ""Search By Lowest Fares"" or ""Search By Schedule.""  We 
also added a gold star to denote ""continental.com promotional fares,"" so you 
know for certain when you receive a discounted, online-only airfare. 

Customer Service 
Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now 
handle all support for online inquiries and reservations services. 

While we've made a number of improvements to the overall experience, this new 
version may not, on the surface, appear to offer significant benefits.  These 
changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for 
the future.  We welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  
Based on feedback from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.

Overall, we're confident that you will appreciate the changes and 
improvements and look forward to continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,
Continental Airlines Inc.


This is a one-time update e-mail.  You have been sent this e-mail as a 
registered eService Online user to inform you of this change in service.

If you have questions or comments, or you would like to unsubscribe please 
"
378,"I have received your payment and will be shipping out your package asap.
Please let me know when it arrives by posting feedback for me on ebay

Thanks

There are several issues with this,  the main one being that we get the

It seems the way this is set up,  IBM will piecemeal us and get a lot of work 
without a significant ""get"" for Enron (ie an outsourcing or a bandwidth or

Are there IT and Process issues?  Is Sally involved.  Maybe they are

We spoke to a total of five employees. Two were suggested by Jenny  Lu 
(Vanessa Schultz and Wally Kinden) and three suggested by Joel Henenberg 
(Mary Gosnell, Bill Hare and Connie Sutton). The investigation did not 
uncover anything that would change our determination to accept Jenny's 
resignation. 

Therefore, Effective November 13, 2000,  We accepted Jenny Lu's resignation.  
This was communicated to Jenny  Lu by Hector McLoughlin.  Hector McLoughlin

395,"Hello, sistas-

Just visited with the coordinator of Josephine's House.   Here's some
additional info. - and we have a few questions to answer:

1) I have reserved the place on my credit card - there will be no actual
charge until the day of the event.

2) For a party of our size, they will offer a choice of soup or salad, 3
entrees and 2 desserts.   If we have a special request, we can let her know;
otherwise the choices will simply be from whatever the Jeffery's chef has
cookin' that night.

3) We need to choose either a soup or a salad for our group.    Preferences?

4) At some point, we will need to decide if we want to do hors deuvres in
addition to the three course meal.   She suggested oysters (for which they
are famous) and then some other, non-seafood appetizer.  These would be
served as guests arrive.

5)  She is faxing me a wine list - and would like to have our selection in
advance of the event.   Also, she asked if we wanted beer and an open bar in
addition to wine.   I told her I'd check with you - but that we wouldn't be
a heavy drinking crowd and that wine would probably be fine.    I thought we
might also want to do champagne - either with the appetizers or sometime
during the meal (maybe dessert?) in case we want to give a toast to the
happy couple.

Thoughts, everyone?      -the youngest and fattest

"
400,"An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town:

Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified

I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a 
short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on 
potential acquisitions.  We have identified our target teams for due 
diligence efforts around commodities.  While each person on the list has 
other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted 
to projects as they arise.  I will review this list continually and update it 
as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent 
job as part of a due diligence team.  I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had 
created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG 
acquisition.  We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this 
checklist so that all are prepared.  Let me know if you are interested in the 
names on my list.  Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence 
effort.  

Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business

I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the 
executive summary from the consulting team.  I followed up with Brent Price 
(my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an 
appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  Currently, Todd Hall 
and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.  Todd has 
other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time 
that Todd would have.  Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the 
lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.  She will be returning to 
Houston from the London office by the end of March.  She will be able to 
split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.  Todd will stay 
involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.  We will also 
keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.  Shelley is expected 
to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week 
regarding our plans.  I will keep you posted. "
401,"You have the right Sally Beck.  I grew up around the corner from your dad and 
used to eat Thursday fried chicken lunches at Tattie's house (now your house) 
with Jim and the whole family.  Plus your mom and I used to spend the night 
at each other's houses when we were in elementary school.  I had heard 
through my sister Cara (who interviewed your grandad for a USTA publication) 
that you were heading to Enron upon graduation.  

I would love to visit with you about your experience so far at Enron.  Call 
my assistant, Patti Thompson, at x39106 and let's set up a time to get 
together.  Monday or Tuesday next week would be good.  I look forward to 
seeing you.  By the way, our oldest daugher, age 16, is Meagan Worthing

"
407,"Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving 
to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for 
the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our 
weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for 
Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I 
can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York 
office.  

It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn 
could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London 
office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some 
feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very 
early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to 
Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well 
organized and control minded.  Understands Enron's business.  Managing a 
group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that 
people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are 
a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her 
based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  

Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.  
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would 
definitely represent an Enron point of view.  They have two small daughters - 
she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost 
that way.  

This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.  
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you 
could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally   "
408,"Just a quick note to see how you are doing.  I mentioned your name today to 
Kristin Albrecht.  She is a Senior Director over Risk Management for Enron 
Broadband Services (EBS).  Kristin and I used to work together in Enron 
Americas, and we had lunch today to catch up.  She grew up in Wharton and is 
an A&M graduate, so it occurred to me that you two have at least two things 
in common.  I wanted you to know that I have given Kristin your name.  She 
can be another contact for you here at Enron.  If you are interested in what 
is going on at EBS or want to get Kristin's impressions on rotations within 
or outside EBS, she would be great for you to visit with.  

Drop by soon to give me an update on life at Enron for you.  --Sally "

and all looks fine except for page with world map.  Can we add Portland to 
the map?  That is the true trading location that is missing.  If it is tough 
to do, don't worry about it.  Thanks.  --Sally "
411,"Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that within my team that they see the 
promotion as an indication that the work that we do is recognized as 
meaningful.  All of that helps me in recruiting and retaining talented people 
that make my job easier and more fun!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS 

Enron Global Markets - Coal and Emissions Trading 
The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EnronOnline as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of bringing synfuel on EnronOnline is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread.  

The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal.  

Enron Energy and Operational Services - ENA Solid Fuel Initiative 
ENA started development of a Coal Initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide Enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections.  Because of the culture shock associated the use of the words  'Enron' and 'coal' in the same sentence, consideration was been given to changing the name to DNG (Dense Natural Gas); however, we went with Solid Fuel Initiative.

This initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ENA feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit.  The primary areas are Texas, Florida, southeastern Ohio and the central Rocky Mountain Area.  There are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued:  Brownsville, TX and Brighton FL.  In Brownsville, the Team secured formal Owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the Brownsville Ship Channel.  This approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay.

A 500 MW facility is being considered for Brownsville.  As conceptualized, it will consist of two - 250 MW (net) CFB units (Circulating Fluidized Bed) Boilers. The boilers will be fired by petroleum coke (petcoke) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible.  One of the advantages of locating this facility near Brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity.  There is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity.  As stated the plant is initially 500 MW, but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 MW facility.

The EEOS team is starting to grow and currently includes Hilda Akin & Cheryl Kent, Project Admin Assistants, Bill Fox as PEM, and Paula Solomon as PCM.  As the project develops there will be more team members required.  In addition, as the Florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team.   

eSource 
eSource, Enron's research group, recently posted on its website a Forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies.  These reports are free and available to all Enron employees on the eSource Hot Topics page at http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp <http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp>.  To date, over 1,600 employees have downloaded ""Spending Wisely on Private Hubs"", a report valued at $2,000.  Over 1,100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports, provided by Investext.  The reports, which are updated continuously, are presented in folders by company and industry.  New folders are being added upon request.  To submit a suggestion for a new folder, please complete the suggestion form at http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp <http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp>.  

Watch for the new eSource bulletin, The Source.  It will feature frequently requested searches, tips on finding information, new products, services, and events.

Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's information needs, eSource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to Enron employees.  

Enron Freight Markets 
EFM signed a firm contract with Streamline Shippers Association last week to provide truckload capacity for one-year with EFM's option to extend the contract for up to an additional year.  Streamline transloads international shipments that enter the U.S. through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  Streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country.  EFM will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week.

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties."

Detailed Description:"

PG&E's California Gas Transmission would like to invite you to a meeting to
be held in San Francisco, CA on Monday, October 22, 2001.  We would also
love for you to join us for a welcome lunch and activity on Sunday, October
21.  This will be a lot of fun so plan on flying into San Francisco early if
possible.  (With the airline reliability being what it is, it's a good idea
to arrive prior to Monday morning anyway.)

Here are a few ideas for the agenda:

*	GISB 1.5 - Will the new standards affect your nomination schedules
and processing times?
*	Hourly Scheduling - Is anyone planning to implement this and would
like to perform a demo?
*	Balancing solutions for problems caused by timing issues in the
Intraday 2 cycle.
*	637 Segmentation - How is everybody addressing this?
*	GISB Capacity Release Standard 5.3.2 - possible scheduling issue.
*	Demonstrations of new services being offered by pipelines.
*	Cross Contract Ranking update.
*	Nominations & Contracting Systems best practices/benchmarking.
*	What is our purpose?

Comments regarding these recommended agenda items and other suggestions are
welcome.

For planning purposes, we need to know how many of you will be attending the
meeting, and the Sunday welcoming activity.  Please RSVP by July 30, 2001,

432,"The following individuals have been identified for the training/knowledge sharing that was discussed at this week's meeting.  

Randy Bryan, Mike Bodnar, Legale Black, Richard Hanagriff, Alice Johnson, Dennis Lee and Jim Studebaker 

As discussed, the session will cover the following:  
	1.  Inventory of commonly used Universes and their data structure (4 hours)
	2.  Description of the canned reports that currently exist and how they are being used.  (2 hours)
	3.  Q&A and assistance in developing reports (2 hours).  This was not discussed but I think this would be a valuable use of time.  

The GL directors agreed that along with notifying these individuals that they will receive further Business Objects training, they are to bring a list of needed reports from their respective areas to develop in the days (or weeks) immediately following the class. 

Gas Logistics goal is to develop individuals that can create complex reports using Business Objects and reduce its reliance on IT and Don in developing such reports.  

Please let us know when you think you will be able to hold the session.  Our expectation on timing is within the next six weeks.  Mike Bodnar will be the ""lead"" from Gas Logisitics so please rely on him for support.

way. Tx Rick

PS I stopped down earlier to thank you for a great job on the BOD meeting. 
See you at 4:30."
437,"Rick:

I suggest that you, Ted, D Hardy and I visit by phone in the next couple of 
days to further discuss communication between the various groups involved.  
It would be useful for D Hardy and I to further describe some of the behind 
the scenes conversations that occurred involving the principal groups (ie. 
RAC, Acctg, Logistics, Legal and Commercial) and the sequence and timing of 
those conversations.  I believe it will be most useful for you to have a 
better understanding of the interaction among the groups as this is discussed 
among senior management in the coming weeks.  I firmly believe that the 
Accounting/Commcl. Support and Logistics groups got much to close to 
commercial and were not second guessing some of the key issues.  Some of our 
more difficult conversations and resistance when collecting information came 
from commercial support and logistics, not just commercial.  Given the nature 
of discussions around this issue, it is important that we have this 
conference call some time this week.  Let me know when you have some time or 
alternatively have Karen schedule with Sharon.

On a related note, at some point there was a struggle within Liquids 
concerning control over trading in the Helsinki office (between London and 
Ilkka).  Although the Helsinki office was originally intended only as a 
marketing office, in some respects it evolved into a stand-alone operation.  
I can not see where there was a conscious decision for it to be more than a 
marketing outpost and it would appear the decision concerning the amount of 
control enjoyed by Ilkka and his team came solely down to K Beasley.  I would 
like to discuss this in this call as well."
438,"Just wanted to compliment Tom Moran, Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett for 
all their efforts to help our commercial initiatives. As busy as they always 
are they are a pleasure to deal with and usually supportive of our 
transactions if the deal deserves their attention. "

     ... how about an LBO?

Certain high net worth executives sponsor the deal in conjunction with a
major financial investor such as JPM/Chase or Citibank.  Force the share
trust participants to go along and cut in all management and employees.  It
gets the company out of the spotlight and might have some real attraction
for deal starved investors... esp at this price level.  It could remotivate
everyone and provide a way to recover some of the lost value that had
accrued to the employees over the years.  Obviously, some stakeholders
would do better that others but that's the way it goes sometimes.

Just a thought.

Hang in there.

469,"I am writing you to inform you of an incident that occurred at the NCL
FRACTIONATOR this week. I would like to go into detail on what occurred to
ensure that everyone has a good understanding of what kind of employee is
involved and the potential for further intentional acts like this from this
disgruntled employee. I would like to have some feedback on this to ensure
that we take the necessary means to ensure that we cover all of the basis.

On Wednesday 1/31/01 we had a PSV go off on one of our process vessels due
to a plant upset. I was notified that the incident was minimal with no
spill or Hydrocarbon release which exceeded the reportable quantity. I
quickly drove to the sight and investigated the incident, I found the
information to be true. There was no detectable hydrocarbon, only a small
amount of rust on the ground which was ejected from the inside of the
emergency stack. I notified the head plant operator & requested an incident
report to be filled out, which he has since delivered to me. I checked the
stack chart and noticed only a small release. At this point I felt that
there was no reason to call in a breakdown to the APCD because we had
neither exceeded the reportable quantity, and the equipment did as it was
designed breaking no rules. I then assigned a clean up crew and an employee
to inspect the PSV's and ensure the proper operation of the equipment
involved. All was cleaned up and the equipment serviced properly, and I am
currently going over the incident report with our safety coordinator.

During the clean up on the day of the incident I was approached by our
Utility Operator Clark Layshot who was on during the incident. Clark was
very upset and was pointing the finger at Mark Stringer who was the Head
Operator on duty. Clark said that the PSV had gone off for an hour and had
released over 5000 gallons of NGL. I new this to be untrue for many
reasons, for one I responded quickly enough that the liquid would still
have been there on the ground, the chart showed exactly the time of
starting and stopping of the release which was just a matter of minutes, I
also new because I was on the phone with the others involved on my drive
out to the plant. I listened to Clarks remarks and let him know that I was
investigating the incident and the discussion was ended.

The following day while I was giving a operational tour to Eugene Ogorman,
I was confronted once more by Clark who said he needed to speak to me
immediately, so I excused myself and met with Clark. Clark said that I
could either have 5 hours or 2 weeks, I asked Clark what he meant and he
said that he was giving his notice. I then asked him why when he became
extremely hostile and said in many words that he was very unhappy! He told
me that everyone was liars, that ENRON was a horrible company, that the
facility was going to blow up and how he was going to kick some of the
employees asses. This went on for a while with numerous other extremely
intense encounters. I then notified my boss, Rick Suderman who in turn made
the appropriate calls.

Today we were the recipients of an incident investigation performed by the
SJVU APCD. We were met by Mike Oldershaw of the APCD who typically does our
compliance testing. Mike informed us that his office was notified of an
incident which released for 48 hours NGL through our west emergency stack.
They were also told that the ground was saturated with hydrocarbon and
insinuated that EOTT/ETS operations was trying to hide this.

Myself and Rick Suderman accompanied Mike through the complete
investigation which included inspection of the release sight, inspection of
the operator logs, inspection of the stack flow charts, and an emission
inspection of the components involved. Mike expressed to us that who ever
called in was disgruntled and obviously fabricated a story to try and
create problems for the company. We went over the permit for the usage of
the emergency stack and all agreed that we were not in violation. Mike was
not sure if a breakdown needed to be reported, so he agreed to call us with
the final outcome of this investigation once he discussed it with his boss.

I am happy to say that after all of this Mike Oldershaw called me back and
said that he had talked to his boss and they both agree that we followed
the rules and none were broken. Mike said that we were in compliance and
there would be no NOTICE OF VIOLATION, the equipment did as it was designed
and the operations group worked well in controlling and isolating the
situation. Mike said that he feels very good about what EOTT and ETS is
doing and the approach that we are taking to ensure compliance. I have
since notified Larry Campbell who informed me to call John steenberg and to
send an email to all of you.

If there are any questions please contact me, thanks for all of your help,
Scott"
470,"I contacted Jim Saddler with AcuVac regarding rental rates on his SVE 
equipment (S.A.V.E. systems). He indicated that rental on a single unit would 
be $5000 per month and rental on two units would be $4000-$4500 per unit per 
month. I also contacted Baker Furnace regarding rental of comparable SVE 
equipment and they indicated that rental would be $3000 per month. In light 
of this, I suggest we establish a rental rate for the TW units, as is, at 
$2500 per unit per month. 

I also discussed costs associated with refurbishing old units with John Sachs 
at Baker Furnace. John indicated that they have already replaced the old 
Baker Fax telemetry systems with Sensaphone 2000 systems on several used 
units. He also indicated the various options they have for silencing the 
units. It can be done, but apparently, adding silencers to the blower is not 
a simple modification.

We are set up to move the units to Midland next week, but I think we should 
strongly consider shipping the units back to Baker Furnace for these 
modifications. John indicated that they could turn them around in about two 
weeks. Allowing for shipping time, this would place the units back in Midland 
around June 20th (a more realistic date would be June 30th). A rough cost 
estimate is $18000 ($7000 per unit plus $4000 shipping). I believe this would 
save both time and cost compared to trying to do the modifications in 
Midland. We would also end up with ""good as new"" units. As a compromise 
between EOTT and TW, if EOTT would pick up the costs for the refurbishing 
then TW could lower the rental rate to something on the order of $2000 per 
unit per month."
471,"Larry here is the list.  We have 2 additions on the bottom.  This is the

473,"Randy, I need your assistance with something.  Im trying to determine 
compliance for all the EOTT crude oil storage tanks in the Midland Region.  
Bill told me that you have a spreadsheet of the EOTT tanks showing some of 
the tank characteristics (size, storage, date of installation, state etc). 
Whatever you have, I would greatly appreciate your shaing it with me.  E mail 
works best for me.  

Thanks again.

If you send this to me, I promise to let you out fish me like you did in

474,"Attended the Southwestern Region cross funcitional training meeting in 
Albuquerque.  Gave a presentation to team leaders on the Transwestern system 
about the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and partnership opportunities and 
employee participation .

Attended the Navajo Nation training session for newly adopted regualtions for 
public water systems on the Navajo Nation.  Transwestern has 3 facilites 
which are public water systems on the Nation.  The new regualtions will be 
taken back to each location and immediately implemented.

A presentation was given to the MIdland Region about  monthly R-3 condensate 
reports which are required to be submitted to the Railroad Commission.  The 
status of the field teams participation in the completion of the EOTT tank 
database spreadsheet  was also discussed. "
475,"Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air 
Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 
C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this 
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further 
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was 
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of 
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing 
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide 
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to 
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received 
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, 
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher 
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not 
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by 
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is 
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern 
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this 
turbine at their descretion.

In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a 
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than 
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be 
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple 
cycle.   

  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to 
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the 
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern 
has 30 days to request another hearing. 

Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and 
handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
conference call for sometime next week? "
476,"Larry - I've received a copy of the compliance order.  It assesses a penalty 
of $15,000 per day for each day of violation (May 1996 to September 8, 1997 
or  496 days).  This results in a fine of $7.44 million.  I hope the order 
has a typo and the NMED meant a penalty of ""up to"" $15,000 per day of 
violation. If this is not a typo I see no downside to asking for a hearing 
and a settlement conference. We may do so anyway.  Since we only have till 
mid-July to file the request for hearing which must include very specific 
admissions or denials and the basis of our affirmative defenses, I'd like 
Larry to flesh out the notes below and pull any relevant documentation 
together.....

Dave - let's discuss counsel for this matter in the morning and I'd like to 
make a call to NMED counsel.  I'd be tempted to bring Braddock in even though 
this is New Mexico...

 "
477,"Privileged & Confidential 
Attorney - Client Communication

I just spoke with Mr. Charles de Saillan, Asst. General Counsel for the NMED, 
concerning the referenced Compliance Order.  Apparently the NMED mailed out 
60 of these orders last week.  The NM legislature has adopted a statute of 
limitations under the NM Air Quality Act and the NMED was acting to attempt 
to foreclose the use of this defense.  (Dave - can Mary hunt this new 
legislation down??).

The language in the order assessing a $15,000 penalty per day of violation is 
standard language when the NMED has not assessed a specific figure.  It will 
be a couple of weeks before the NMED will be able to provide us a specific 
penalty.  We discussed settlement and the administrative hearing process.  A 
settlement meeting is not likely to take place soon due to the NMED's 
workload.  We need to have a number from the NMED before the settlement 
conference anyway. We will have to file the request to go to hearing no later 
tahn July 18th.  However, Charlie stated that if the respondent evidenced 
good faith to achieve as settlement the Secretary had the discretion to allow 
additional time to submit a full answer (where we provided all of the details 
of our defense.)

I told Charlie we would be organizing ourselves internally and that we would 
get back to him with some proposed dates for a settlement conference, a 
request for hearing and a request to extend the time in which to file an 
answer - preferably tied to after the settlement conference.

Let's see about dates and Dave or I will call the NMED and submit a letter 
with the three items above.  We want to make sure that the NMED has time 
before the end of the 30 day period to respond to our request for an 
extension on the answer.

479,"John some quick thoughts on agenda items for the meeting with PG&E:

1. Status of the mini filter separator installations at PG&E 
interconnect/delivery/receipt points?  Future thoughts/plans for additional 
separator installations.

2. PG&E customer attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their 
equipment.  Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs?

3. Internal sampling activities.  How far have PCB's spread into the PG&E 
system.  (wipe tests results versus liquids collections). A map would be 
nice   depicting this.

4. Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry 
on the Topock lateral.  Maybe we should have a little presentation showing  
liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral.  Our 
commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible. 

5. We might consider sharing what we've learned from our PCB modeling study 
with Penn State and what our  future plans are.  Another Tranwestern effort 
to  show our commitment.

John, if we plan on opening up our separator, has a decision been  made to 
decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters.  
If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs, we will need to line 
out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems.  Id like to 
discuss possibly not using  Vector for this type of routene activity any 
longer.  There is a company in Farmington, NM (Riley) that can probably do 
the job.  As you know, this decon work is not rocket science and Vector is 
$$$$$$$, although they do a good job. 

Chew on these and if I think of any other additional topics, Ill send them 
your way.....By the way, Earl Chanley is now in Roswell.  FYI in case you 
plan on asking him to attend the meeting........

487,"I was just informed by the Navajo Nation that prior to receiving approval 
from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines, an archeology survey is 
to be performed at each compressor station site.  Be advised that an 
archeologist will be present at sta. 3 on 3/ 9 this friday in the am and at 
sta. 4 on 3/12 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys.  Please 
have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and 
allow access to the facility by the archeologist.  The survey should only 
last 3-4 hours.  

Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal 
once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation  said that 
under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural 
resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review 
the findings before they are required to issue the final report.  She didnt 
think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back 
logs, and personnel, it might.  Ill keep the pressure on.

The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might 
require.  Birds of a feather...  Ill be persistent here also.......and let

505,"As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

520,"The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=

mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Surprise your pals on August 5 with a gift from our Friendship Day

546,"Hi Larry,

We haven't heard from you for a while and wanted to check back with you.  
Have you made a purchase yet?  If so, we would appreciate a reply to this 
message telling us you have already purchased so we will know not to send any 
more follow up messages.

If you are still shopping, is there anything we can do to help you with your 
buying decision?  Our goal is to help you make an informed decision that you 
will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

"
556,"On April 24, 2001, the NYISO deployed code changes affecting Class 1 PURPA
transactions in the billing system and modified bid status flagging in the
MIS.  These changes impacted settlements for 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 -
forward.

There was a code design problem with the PURPA code change that resulted in
an error in the computation of balancing energy for some class 1 units that
resulted in their purchasing their entire day-ahead schedules in the
balancing market.  There was also an oversight in the implementation of the
modified bid status flagging in the MIS such that those bids were not
transferred into the billing system, impacting bid production cost
guarantee settlements for the units with a modified bid status.

The NYISO will be posting supplemental invoices for April 2001 settlements
by 2300, today, Tuesday, May 15th to adjust for the aforementioned issues.
Funds due the NYISO for this supplemental invoice should be transferred
into the NYISO Clearing Account by close of business Wednesday, May 23,
2001.  Funds due Market Participants from the NYISO for this supplemental
invoice will be transferred into Market Participant accounts by close of
business Friday, May 25, 2001.

PLEASE NOTE THAT: Funds due the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements which
were invoiced on May 7, 2001 should be transferred into the NYISO Clearing
Account by close of business Wednesday, May 16, 2001, as scheduled.  Funds
due Market Participants from the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements
invoiced on May 7, 2001 will be transferred into Market Participant
accounts by close of business Monday, May 21, 2001, as scheduled.

Please be aware that as per the ISO Services Tariff any disputed amounts
are to be paid in full.  Upon resolution of the dispute, if it is
determined that an overpayment has been made by the Customer, a refund,
with interest, will be made by the ISO


In order to reconcile customer invoices for the supplemental April 2001
invoice, it will be necessary to net the following versions of the daily
advisory statements:

564,"April 20, 2001

To Market Participants:

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO will premier its

? new website design. The visual
presentation of the site is
being refreshed to convey a bold presence on the Internet and present a clear,
consistent, hi-tech look and
feel to the site. This represents the completion of phase I of the web refresh
project and is part of the
NYISO Strategic Initiatives.

For a period of two weeks (until May 8, 2001), both the new and old websites
will be operated in parallel.
On May 8, 2001 (unless notified differently), the old site will be 
discontinued.
The NYISO has planned
the transition to be as seamless as possible for our Market Participants and
Guests.

Several paths are available to access the new site. Direct links will be 
placed
on the NYISO home page
and on the What?s New page under Hot Topics. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE BOOKMARKS OR
SCRIPT FILES!!!!!!!!!!!! Once the transition period is ended, the NYISO will
rename the server
containing the new website to the address of the old website. With this plan,
Users will NOT be required
to modify bookmarks and/or script files.

The URL addresses for the MIS portion of the web site, the billing statements,
and the LBMP data HAVE
NOT and WILL NOT change. Access to these areas of the site will not change and
Users will not need to
modify any procedures.

What Users can expect to see is consistent fonts, style rules, symbols, 
colors,
etc. This will enhance
navigation and improve the functionality of the site. Phase II of this project
will address site architecture,
file structure, and make substantial improvements to site navigation and data
content. Information
gathered from onsite interviews with Market Participants from each sector will
be used in the
implementation of Phase II changes.

Market Participants should contact their Customer Relations Representative if
they have any questions,
comments, concerns, and/or problems. All others may contact Customer Relations
at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
The Web Refresh Team"

569,"1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project.

Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on 
schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.  
PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of 
separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon 
tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not 
create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, 
according to PG&E, are in place.

PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to 
discuss maintenance issues with ET&S.

Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. 
pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or 
disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E 
will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or 
dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has 
indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce 
costs associated with cleaning the pipe.

2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. 

Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at 
MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round 
of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples 
collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to 
be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels 
north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing 
showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has 
been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be 
collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant 
to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is 
considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.

Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The 
gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas 
Co.  system which is PCB free.

3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. 

West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system 
has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these 
locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to 
have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the 
sampling program.  
Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs 
under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the 
pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the 
bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By 
increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.

It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the 
separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.

4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.

Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter 
separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The 
determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) 
a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of 
the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.
Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) 
have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern 
River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have 
shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this 
location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that 
there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume 
of gas deliveries.

PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional 
filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer 
load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection 
at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express 
additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.

5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.

 a. Siting, Design and Engineering

 b. Cost Estimates 

PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus 
an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next 
week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter 
separators may be proposed for installation.  

The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 
indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have 
not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites 
basis as PG&E presented.

One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions 
of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement 
company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the 
success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the 
cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it 
will be a 2001 project.

6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.

Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic 
sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to 
the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the 
Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies 
to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will 
coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.

7. Other Issues or Concerns.

Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 
2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to 
Transwestern.  

PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 
mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S 
configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.  

8. Next Steps.

The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow 
inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection   
additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location 
of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as 
some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
other business.  "

578,"It has been communicated that the vacation policy has, indeed, been approved by the Board Of Directors.  What needs to happen now is that a true cost estimate needs to be provided to the HR Heads (David Oxley?) so that funding for the system changes can be obtained.

ISC -- please put together a project scope document to configure SAP to do the following:

Vacation accrual will occur for all employees as it does now for new hires their first year.
Only 40 hours of ""automatic"" carryover will be allowed.  Any additional vacation carryover must be approved.
Employees will be able to go into vacation arrears up to their maximum entitlement for the year, plus any carryover.

I know this doesn't cover all of the details, but wanted to give you as much as I knew.  Please let me know when you'd like to get a meeting together to go over complete requirements, and I'll help pull that meeting together.

Payroll -- from a process perspective, it is my understanding that we will take as much overpayment as possible from the final payroll check.  It would probably be helpful to document how that process is carried out, and then put together a proposal on how it could be handled in the future -- TPC?  HR Rep?, etc.

Please let me know if anyone needs any additional information at this time; otherwise, I'll wait to hear from the ISC on when they'd like to get the requirements-gathering session put together.

Thanks.

590,"Michelle,

Our group has been asked by EEL (Liz Barrett) to deploy the attachment survey.  We (HRGIM) would like to ensure the language of the survey is consistent with the policies and procedures of Enron Corp.  Legal (Jon Chapman) has reviewed the document.  Any insight you can provide is appreciated.

 

Regards,
Milton

P.S.  Liz Barrett's comments are below regarding the rationale behind the ethnic descriptions in the survey.

 ""I worked with Jon Chapman on the survey, so it has been comprehensively done over by legal!  The reason why I've chosen these categories are that they are the accepted categorisations by the Commission for Racial Equality, who are the governing body on race relations in the UK, and are aligned to their counter-parts in Europe.  If we do have a legal challenge, we will be asked to provide data in this fomat, rather than the US descriptors which are not as relevant to the European ethnic profile (for instance 'Hispanic' is not a meaningful category for Europe, whereas it is very significant for the US).  I'd prefer to map the US definitions onto the European ones, but to collect the European data in the CRE's format.""  "

592,"Michelle, what about including a provision like the following in the Severance Pay Plan agreement of waiver and release? 
Employee's remedy for a breach of this Agreement by ____ shall be limited to specific performance of ____'s obligations hereunder to make cash payments of the severance benefit described herein, and Employee shall not have a right to any other remedy, including, but not limited to, rescission or reformation of this Agreement.

593,"Michelle, here is a suggested revision to Section 3.4 B which I believe will accomplish the objective we discussed.  We need to draft procedures to be adopted by the Committee. 
B.  If a terminated employee who is entitled to receive a severance benefit under the Plan receives a notification of layoff from Enron in compliance with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, is placed on a period of paid leave of absence or furlough before termination of employment by Enron, and continues on the payroll of Enron for such period, the severance benefit payable under the Plan shall be reduced and offset, in a manner prescribed in procedures established by the Committee, by the amount of pay received by such employee during such period.

The Direct Service payments are not processed through Payroll and I am not aware of the payment schedule.  I believe these payments are handled by the Service Connection.  Can you please work with Irma Alvarez for this piece?

Is the Fidelity Goal Planner the items which were previously set up a a deduction and were converted to Direct Deposit a few years ago?  If so, these payments will automatically be scheduled for payment on tomorrow.

As discussed:

What happens to my wages/salary if the Company files for bankruptcy
protection?

The general rule is that a company that has filed a banruptcy petition is
not able to make payments on any prepetition debts until a plan of
reorganization is filed.

However, there are certain exceptions to the general rule.

Claims related to wages and salary earned within 180 days of a bankruptcy
petition filing (called ""prepetition wages and salaries"") receive a special
priority for upt to $4650 under the bankruptcy code (section 507(a)(3)) and
are usually paid in full as part of the plan of reorganization.  Most
companies that intend to continue operating while in bankruptcy recognize
the need to keep employees working and the potential hardship that would
occur of wages were not paid or delayed.  As a result, most companies that
file a bankruptcy petition, but which inetend to remain in business, seek
the specific authority of the bankruptcy court to make payments on the
priority wage claims immediately so that employees will experience little
or no disruption in their wage/salary payments while they continue working.
Usually this authority is sought at the same time or shortly after a
bankruptcy petition is filed.  For a company that derives a great deal of
its value from its employees, making sure these payments are made in a
timely manner is a high priority.

Thanks for taking a look at this memo that Andre Sarasin of Papiers Stadacona would like to send out to his employees today. Please note that this will be issued in French, so this English translation is not perfect...but it least it gets the main message across. Please let me know what you think--both Peter and Cheryl have approved this. 

Thanks,
Jennifer
x3-9964

The management of Papiers Stadacona met yesterday and this morning the union representatives as well as the staff personnel to answer their questions concerning Papiers Stadacona's situation and its owner's.

Mr. Sarasin repeated that the activities of Papers Stadacona are profitable and he has the conviction that it is in the interest of all parties concerned to continue the operations of Papers Stadacona and the Quebec Mill.

In several circumstances during the last quarter of century, the different owners of our company have had financial difficulties and, in every case, the Quebec Mill continued to operate for the simple reason that it is profitable. Mr. Sarasin believes that the present situation is no exception to the rule.

On the other hand, concerning questionings on the pension plan of employees, we are to be reminded that these funds are completely independent from the Company. Indeed, these are placed in trust with the Royal Trust and no creditor can have access to these funds.

The current situation can evolve quickly, but whatever is the result, our strategy is to fill our obligations, i.e. to make papers and board of quality, to control our costs and to continue to improve our productivity and the efficiency of our mill.

601,"I just got a call from Li Sun.  She is expecting to get her H-1 visa anytime, and wants to make sure that she receives it.  Should we have her contact Tindall & Foster directly?  Also, by law, when an individual on an H-1b visa is terminated, the company is required to provide them a one way ticket back to their home country.  Does that still apply in a bankruptcy?  If so, who will be handling those arrangements?

602,"Michelle,

Kristin Walsh, a manager in Competitive Analysis, is returning from maternity leave on October 15th.  During Kristin's absence, the following changes have occurred in the group, and I just wanted to run them by you before we communicate them to her:
1)  Kristin will only have two direct reports instead of three.
2) Previously, Kristin's team as a whole was responsible for providing ENA (i.e. John and Louise, as well as traders) with competitive intelligence.  Instead of Kristen just overseeing the ENA process as a whole, Kristin and her two team members will have more specific duties, although Kristin will still be the primary point of contact for ENA.  Specifically, Kristin will gather and provide intelligence info for the Gas Team, and Kelly Holman will gather and provide info for East Power, and  Greg Whitman will do the same for West Power.  Robert Johnston, Kristin's supervisor,  and Scott Tholan, BUL, just felt like the level of service that Kristin's team was providing was not adequate because efforts were duplicated and Kristin could not provide enough ""face time"" with the head traders to gather and relay info, as well as directing her team.  

Also,after Kristin's departure, it was learned that Kristen signed a contract for which she had no authority. Although Scott does not think that this has happened before, this particular contract blew up in their face.

Upon Kristin's return, Scottt, Robert, and I would like to communicate these changes to her (not in writing, just verbally), and just reitterate the fact that only Scott has the authority to sign contracts.  Additionally, we would like to tell Kristin that she needs to take a management training class so that she can learn to delegate and oversee responsibilities of the group, rather than micromanaging them.  Please let me know if this is going to create any additional problems, or if I need to take a different approach.  

As always, thanks for your help.
Anne"
603,"I think this is a pre-petition expense. I'm not sure if we can pay. Arguably it falls into the $15000 business expenses limit inclusive of the $4500, i.e. net $10500. Bottom-line, Michelle needs to make a ruling.
 "
604,"Looks fine.

605,"Michelle,

I hope you had a good Christmas.

I would appreciate if you could please let me know
where you stand with the agreement to release both me
and Enron from the obligations contained in my
employment contract.

I have a firm offer for employment that is running out
of time. I would greatly appreciate your help in
resolving this issue as soon as possible.

by email as per our understanding.

606,"Michelle,
We may reap the most benefit by having all the site HR Managers, Site Safety
Supervisors/Nurse Practitioners, Mike Indivero, Tony Bolar Softich(Safety),
Steve Olenik(Safety), Sean Mayer(Construction), Frank Petty(Director of
Construction), Mike Ranz(VP Construction), Bob Black(Manager Of Projects),
maybe a few other home office construction managers selected by Mike Ranz or
Frank Petty in attendance. I think you and Rick need to chair the meeting
because you will lend credibility and importance to the issue. You may even
want to invite whoever is John Gillis's boss(or his designee) to sit in to
emphasize the importance of this issue. Too often I hear ""Enron has plenty
of money"" and ""Thats why we have lawyers"" -the truth being we are the
guardians of our stockholders assets and we have a fudiciary responsibility
to protect those assets for the health and well being of the company, the
stockholders and the employees of Enron Corp. My experience has been that we
do a good deal of back stabbing and finger pointing when HR, Safety and
Construction get together and meet on anything. Liability/Settlement checks
regardless of the amount needs to be an issue along with the improvement of
the employment offer process and who is authorized to make decisions
effecting employment offers. In the end if supervisors or managers fail to
act prudently and in the best interest of the company then there is a
penalty. The penalty being they won't get the opportunity to lose more of
the companies money by making reckless decisions. Thats the approach I would
take with these people. The Weigle case does not need to be looked at like
it only cost us $490.00. This continued reckless disregard we have in our
decision making process is going to hit us big one of these days and we will
replace Foster Wheeler's Blue Island Racial Graffitti charge & settlement as
something the EPC Industry talks about. I may be overreacting here but I've
been in the middle of Nepco's harassment, discrimination other issues for
the last 18 months. Call me if you have any questions. Thanks for asking.

We are wanting to rescind Michael Slayton's offer of employment in Marlin Gubser's group.  He is currently working at New Power and his start date with Enron is December 28th.  He has not given notice because he has an agreement with New Power to stay on his current project until the end of the year.  He has already signed and returned his offer letter. Marlin feels that Michael is a non-essential hire and would like to rescind his offer . Please advise how we should handle this situation.

Thanks,

	Todd Menzing called me up a few days ago to ask if he could send a letter to me about what I understand to be his representation of a former Enron employee against us in an HR matter.  I hadn't heard from him, so I followed up today and learned that he had or was going to send a letter to you.

	Menzing is a former V&E associate.  He called me because he knew me from a case in which V&E was representing a party in a commercial litigation matter, and I was representing an Enron employee in a deposition in that matter.

	Maybe there is an easy, no-brainer answer to what appears to be a potential disqualification issue for both Menzing and his firm (remember the mad cow disease of legal ethics? ) but if you were not already aware of Menzing's prior employer, I thought I'd let you know.

613,"Just got off conference call with Wachovia to review trust arrangement particularly to ensure that this is effective in not triggering tax until time of payment rather than triggering tax at funding of trust.  We think this arrangement does that as long as the following is true:
Funds put in trust should not be paid out until 2002 to provide for ""service period/vesting"" requirement
Must be irrevocable i.e. funds can never come back to employer so need to be careful not to overfund

Also, to keep from being subject to ERISA, need to assume that payments are not delayed until termination.  (IF subject to ERISA, creates ugly reporting/compliance issues and discrimination testing.....)

 The issue of whether to set up a new employer i.d. to hold the trust is a question - might provide more security and protection in the event of bankruptcy but might create tax deductibility issues.  Might be better if we could set up subparts for different employers to ensure tax deductibility.  I will run by external tax counsel with utmost discretion.  

If this is to be used for non-U.S. employees, need to ensure arrangement doesn't trigger taxable event at funding due to local tax law.  May not be an issue.

Are we contemplating including any insiders?

619,"Attached is one of the plan documents that has been revised in the following manner: 
The beginning of Section 3.2 was revised to include a ""subject to"" provision. 
Section 3.4 was separated into two parts.  Part A is the original provision.  Part B is a new provision. 
Using this revised design, every laid off employee, whether subject to WARN, would receive the same net amount of severance benefit, whether a WARN penalty had to be paid by the employer, whether a WARN notice was given in advance of layoff, or whether WARN did not apply to the lay off in any way.

660,"BRUSSELS, Aug. 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The pressure of producing market pulp below cost is likely to provide its own outlet, according to a number of sources. Suppliers from North America's West Coast have been producing in the red for some time now and severe downtime will be forced upon them, providing the sharp slimming of inventories which is required for recovery. One supplier predicted, ""It won't be long before we get better prices and conditions.""
Suppliers in the southern states of the US and eucalyptus producers are suffering similarly unprofitable business. Southern pine is a rarity now in Europe, as the home market proves more attractive. And some South American eucalyptus producers have turned the supply tap off in Italy. But Italian activity has proved a reliable barometer for market direction in the past and it is the Italian buyers who are seeking fixed contracts for two to three months in advance now. This is reported to be spreading north.
There are rumblings in South America about a correction to the eucalyptus price. The weakened dollar means that Latin American eucalyptus priced in dollars is cheap compared with European volumes priced in euros. While producers are likely to wait at least until October for the market to see some post-vacation period momentum in the paper market, the intention is clear.
Major producers of northern bleached softwood kraft have indicated they intend to go no lower than $450/tonne, yet the possibility of $440/tonne in September was not dismissed by buyers or sellers. The FOEX benchmark is still slipping, albeit slowly, and there may be another $10/tonne to go before the absolute bottom is reached. This would drive out the spot market almost completely, in particular as prices in Asia are now at very similar levels to those in Europe. Pulp buying in Asia is said to have picked up thanks to the low prices. One supplier said, ""The spot market in Europe seems more or less to have disappeared.""
The effect of such low prices combined with any pick-up in woodfree paper sales could provide sufficient impetus for pulp prices to creep up again in the fourth quarter, according to one source. But he warned that if higher cost producers were encouraged by this to enter the fray at 100% production, it could pave the way for a rocky 12 months bumping along the bottom.
Norscan inventories are predicted to end August much as they did in July, which would be contrary to the trend for the month and set the scene for falling stocks in the fourth quarter, if demand picks up to anything like normal levels.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Corporate credit quality will likely grow much=

 likely go into default this year as the United States heads into recession=
, according to reports issued on Monday by two top credit rating agencies.=

Moody's Investors Service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 1=

the 22 companies with $66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade. Rev=
iews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit.=20
""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third q=
uarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next =
year,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist.=20
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's said more than 200 companies will default on a=
bout $100 billion of debt this year, compared with 117 defaulting on a reco=
rd $42.3 billion in 2000.=20
It said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated ""BB-plus"" or lower by=
 S&P and ""Ba1"" or lower by Moody's because of their credit risks - will rea=
ch 9.4 percent by year end. Moody's forecasts a 10 percent rate.=20
""The U.S. economy is clearly in a recession,"" said S&P Chief Economist Davi=
d Wyss in a statement. ""Although Standard & Poor's expects it to be relativ=
ely mild and end in early 2002, the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is=
 high.""=20
Both agencies said the Sept. 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a thr=
ee-year slump in corporate credit quality. Moody's blamed 38 reviews for do=
wngrade in September alone on the attacks.=20
COSTS RISE, PROTECTION WEAKENS=20
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons.=20
These include the weakening economy, the inability of many marginal compani=
es to raise cash at tolerable interest rates, share buybacks, debt-financed=
 merger activity, and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlin=
es, insurance and travel.=20
""Many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dr=
y up and be pushed over the brink,"" said David Keisman, managing director a=
t S&P Risk Solutions.=20
Even well-known companies are suffering rating declines.=20
On Monday alone, for example, S&P downgraded McDonald Corp. after the world=
's largest fast-food chain said it will buy back up to $5 billion of stock,=
 at a time S&P said the company's ""growth prospects for the future are less=
 optimistic.""=20
Meanwhile, Moody's downgraded Enron Corp., and warned it may downgrade it a=
gain. The energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confid=
ence, reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two =
weeks, as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business.=20
Puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year, in part beca=
use interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets =
more conservatively.=20
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing=
 costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost busine=
ss revenues,"" he said.=20
Still, through Friday, Moody's has said in the fourth quarter it may downgr=
ade 47 companies, and upgrade just four.

Enron Bonds Stabilize But Market Players Are Concerned

One money manager said he was concerned ""about the fallout and its impact o=
n the company's ability to trade"" energy.=20
The company's bonds already have suffered as a result of the uncertainty. T=
he bonds with a 6.40% coupon maturing in 2006 were offered at a dollar pric=

667,"Welcome to this week's Eyeforenergy Update.  Just to refresh your memories,
this update is sent to you, alternating each week with the main Eyeforenergy
Briefing to let you know of any developments on the Eyeforenergy.com
website, including publication of new stories, whitepapers and special
features, as well as the latest news on our upcoming conferences.

If you visit our homepage www.eyeforenergy.com, you will see that our newest
Featured Content is a special report, commissioned by Norsk Hydro ASA and
produced by the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research
- Oslo.  This takes a look at the current status of climate negotiations and
the Kyoto agreement, particularly after COP7 towards the end of last year.
It's most interesting aspect for Eyeforenergy readers is how it takes a look
at implications for business in terms of compliance, mechanisms and funding,
even for countries which have chosen not to ratify Kyoto such as the USA.
Scroll down the page to read the full report...

On the same subject, early discounted registration is now available for our
CO2 Trading: The North American Market conference, 18-20 June in Chicago,
which already has companies such as DuPont, Entergy, TransAlta, Natsource,
Entergy and Cinergy on board.  Look out for the full program for this event,
which will be published on our website tomorrow.  We can also announce that
the number of industries who will be talking about their energy management
strategies for the first time at Strategy Energy Management USA is growing,
including the likes of International Paper, North Star Steel, Nestl? and
more.  Keep an Eye on future Eyeforenergy Updates for more information as it
becomes available.

Lastly, we are now taking early no-obligation applications for our
forthcoming members only Premium Content subscription area, which will
entitle you to a discount off the already very low price.  See down for
further details...

  <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/dot_clear.gif>	Dear Member,

This is one of our favorite times of the year. With the holiday rush behind us, and the spring still several chilly weeks away, February is a wonderful month to settle down indoors with all those books you've had on your reading list. In this issue of the Readers' Advantage Newsletter, enrich your reading with a closer look at some authors you know, and an introduction to some we think you should know about. And don't forget to look in our Great Reads section, where our fiction buyer, Sessalee Hensley, has made her choice of great fiction titles out this month. You'll find all this and more -- enough to make you almost wish February would last longer -- so cozy up and enjoy this month of reading.	   <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/dot_clear.gif>

Andrea Barrett, Map Studies <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIJ0Am>
""I came to writing fiction late, clumsily, and by a process that still remains a bit mysterious even to me,"" says Andrea Barrett, whose fiction speaks volumes about the ways in which we discover our true passions -- and what it means for Barrett to have found her own. Her latest, Servants of the Map, reveals profound connections between a number of characters who made appearances in her earlier books, Ship Fever and The Voyage of the Narwhal, and is highly recommended reading. We had a chance to talk with Andrea Barrett via email about her writing, her characters, and her latest work, in our exclusive Q&A <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIJ0Am>.

""It's All About the Madeleines,"" by Anne Ursu <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0GNW0A6>
""My novel, Spilling Clarence, is about memory -- or rather it's about remembering, which, I've come to believe, is a different kettle of fish,"" writes Anne Ursu in our exclusive essay. A selection of the 2002 Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers program, Spilling Clarence asks probing questions about the nature of memory -- and why we choose to forget. Read on to find out more about the origins of this very original debut, in ""It's All About the Madeleines <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0GNW0A6>.""

Biography, with Geoffrey Ward <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0HHX0A2>	   <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/dot_clear.gif>	Speaking of...  Exclusive <http://www.readersadvantage.com/newsletter/images/exclusive_sm.gif>
Biography, with Geoffrey Ward <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0HHX0A2>
""Nobody today comes close to Twain,"" says Geoffrey C. Ward, author of Mark Twain, the companion biography to the Ken Burns documentary film that appeared on PBS in January. Perhaps no author in American history has achieved the international recognition of Mark Twain -- both as a writer and celebrity. Ward, who has collaborated with Burns on legendary projects such as Jazz and The Civil War, now presents us with a wise portrait of a writer whose inimitable wit and insight into the human condition have stood the test of time. In our exclusive Q&A, we asked Geoffrey C. Ward a few questions <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0HHX0A2> about his work with Ken Burns, and about the public and private persona of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, a.k.a. Mark Twain.

A Conversation with Anthony Doerr <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIK0An>
""In a lot of ways, writing is a way for me to see other places in the world that I can't physically go to,"" says Anthony Doerr, whose debut collection, The Shell Collector, takes his readers from Tanzania to the American West, from Africa to New England. At 28, Doerr has already visited parts of the world many of us may only know through reading. And in his remarkable debut collection of stories, a selection of the 2002 Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers program, we see what truths there are to be learned when one has spent time as a stranger in a strange land. Find out more in our exclusive interview <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FIK0An>.

Let's be honest, we love chocolate and use every holiday possible as a reason to give and gladly receive the delectable indulgence. But more than any other holiday, Valentine's Day is a great time to give chocolate - not only because of its sweet connotations, but also because of chocolate's historical association with romance. Don't miss our recommendations for some great books to sweeten the gift <http://email.bn.com/cgi-bin6/flo?y=hFVU0EUb180Bvf0FpW0Ae>! And, thanks to our friends at Godiva, read more about the food that has been linked to love for more than 2000 years.

695,"Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Please note Carla McGinley, an Ashford UMC member and friend of mine, is going on a Walk to Emmaus weekend retreat the middle of March, 2002.  It will be held at the JbarJ Ranch in Sealy.  In an effort to help her sponsor Kathy Eason and to encourage Carla we respectfully ask your assistance as well.

Some of you know Carla very well, others only slightly and some not at all; and yet you do know me.  When I went on my own retreat to Emmaus in 1994 I was incrediably blessed then only to realize over the years since the blessing has continued.  We don't always feel the warmest effects of an effort until God chooses it so. I have since served on many teams over the years and each time I am allowed to be present as a person gets time for her/himself I am blown away by the effects of honest heartfelt prayer in action.  Now that Carla has taken the responsibility and position of coordinating the prayer ministry for our church home, Ashford UMC prayer is requested in her name.  

Would you be so kind to either mail or email an encouraging note, bookmark or other thought to me FOR HER and addressed to her so that I can take the messages to leave for her on the walk.  She will not know of these or receive them until she is on the weekend These messages will mean a lot reminding her of the vastness of her brothers and sisters in Christ in prayer; of God's love sent in many forms and will encourage her as she returns to serve the Lord in her famiily, church and the community. Having thoughts from some who know her and SOME WHO DO NOT will touch her I know. These notes will show her as an agape physical form the unconditional love that God has for us.  Her walk will be March so please forward asap to ensure receipt.  I will be participating as an outside 4th day along with her official sponsor Kathy for those of you that have already gone on the walk...join me/us if you l! ike.  

Kathy Eason is her walk sponser. Prayer for Kathy in her support of Carla, the whole walk team, retreatants and their families as well will be the greatest agape (unconditional love gift).  God bless each of you as you take the time to share ideas, a love in Christ thought, a card or a letter of encouragement for Carla as she spends this time away from the daily world and spends it in the Lord with others on her journey.  Nothing brings the heart more encouragement like an unexpected love in Christ message from another person during this time away from the everyday world.

Feel free to ask others that know Carla to join in the messages and forward to me by early March for delivery mid month.

Please notes mail to me for her:

P.O. Box 441150 Houston, TX  77244-1150  (you may enclose a sealed note for her if you prefer)

From 6:00 - 9:00 a.m., the Envision team will re-index the databases.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16
From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

EFET To Set Up Belgian Electricity Task Force

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Federation of Energy Traders said Tuesday 
that it is forming a task force to look into the Belgian electricity market. 
""A number of our members have raised concerns about the trading environment 
in Belgium. This will be examined by the new task force,"" an EFET spokesman 
said.
The Belgian Task Force Electricity will include, among others, 
representatives from TXU Corp. (TXU), RWE Trading, Enron Europe (U.ENE), 
Eneco and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MWD) as well as and an energy 
specialist from the academic sphere. One or two Spanish players may also join 
the group. 
The task force is scheduled to hold its first meeting on May 19, a 
politically sensitive time for Belgium, as it is due to take over the E.U.'s 
rotating presidency from Sweden in June. 
The European Electricity Directive requires member states to have opened up 
at least 26.5% of their electricity markets by 1999. However, according to 
industry groups only 5% of the Belgian market is presently open to 
competition. 
EFET, which has 47 European energy trading companies among its members, has 
already set up a task force to look into the French power market - French 
Task Force Electricity - and a similar group to look at the German gas market 
- German Task Force Gas.

State's Utilities Could Be in Hot Water as Bills Are Due Power: Whether they 
can collect funds for escalating costs is a question that worries Wall 
Street, others.
CHRIS KRAUL
  
09/22/2000 
Los Angeles Times 
Home Edition 
Page A-1 
Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company 
As the meter runs on California's electricity crisis, shock over this 
summer's price spikes is giving way to a new concern: uncertainty over 
whether and how the state's three investor-owned utilities can collect the 
staggering amounts in power costs they haven't been allowed to pass through 
to consumers. 
The unanswered question is how high the bill--now $4 billion and 
counting--will go, and whether consumers will foot all or part of it. And 
that there are no easy answers--perhaps short of an overhaul of the state's 
deregulated power market, or legislation from officials seemingly reluctant 
to act--only adds to the growing anxiety. 
Rate freezes in effect at Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric 
and San Diego Gas & Electric, which serve about three-quarters of the state's 
residents and businesses, are forcing the utilities to borrow an estimated $1 
billion a month to cover their added wholesale costs. Those loans are 
draining the companies' resources and threatening their financial structure, 
analysts say. 
The rising unpaid balance presents a longer-term burden that worries Wall 
Street, the state's business interests and, of course, the utilities. If 
passed along to consumers, the amount could ultimately negate the promised 
benefits of cheap energy that were the reason for being for the landmark 
deregulation of California's electricity industry. But making the utilities 
absorb the entire ""undercollections"" would strike a grievous financial blow 
to the companies. 
The crisis also has created a potential time bomb for shareholders of parent 
companies Edison International and PG&E Corp. Skyrocketing wholesale 
electricity costs are canceling out deregulation's underlying assumption of 
low-cost wholesale energy--and the projected generous retail margins with 
which utilities were to pay off nuclear plants and other uneconomical assets. 
The deregulation law gave utilities until March 2002 to complete the payoff, 
when open-market conditions would take over in their service areas. But with 
wholesale electricity costs where they are, the ""stranded asset"" balances are 
growing instead of shrinking--and posing an enormous potential hit for 
shareholders, who would have to absorb the remaining ""bad asset"" costs after 
the deadline passes. 
Whether the companies' shareholders or ratepayers--or both--end up footing 
the undercollection bill, all Californians could pay in the long run, 
analysts say, if current market problems remain unresolved and the state is 
seen as a less attractive place in which to do business. 
How will it all shake out? Wall Street is as much in the dark as 
Californians, said Lori Woodland, an analyst with Fitch Inc. of Chicago, one 
of three debt-rating agencies to recently lower their outlooks for Southern 
California Edison, PG&E, SDG&E and their parent companies. 
""It's not clear how regulators view this issue,"" Woodland said. ""They may 
permit the utilities to recover their costs [from ratepayers]; they may not. 
That's a big uncertainty, and it may remain this way for months. Meanwhile, 
power prices are very high, and significant amounts of money are flowing out 
the door of the utilities."" 
The uncertain prospects for collecting those billions of dollars also affect 
stock prices, and PG&E in particular has slumped in recent days as the 
implications register with investors. From a high of $31.64 on Sept. 11, PG&E 
shares have dropped to Thursday's close of $23.19 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
Amid the finger pointing and doubts, many wonder if electricity deregulation 
itself could be junked and the state's power industry re-regulated. Others 
suggest that rate freezes be extended indefinitely or hope that the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission now investigating the California electricity 
market will take corrective action to make it all better. 
Although the parties involved all seem fearful of the dimension of the crisis 
and doubtful of any near-term solution, consensus couldn't be less evident 
among the major players on how to deal with it. Although all three utilities 
agree the current market isn't working, they have not come forward with a 
common plan to solve the crisis and aren't working on one, sources say. 
Partial lifting of the rate freezes is advocated by PG&E Corp. and Sempra 
Energy, parent of SDG&E, the first state utility to pay off its stranded 
costs and thus be allowed to fully pass along wholesale costs to customers. 
The state Legislature has since stepped in to freeze SDG&E rates after a 
political firestorm fed by customer protests over bills that doubled and even 
tripled during the summer. 
Lifting the rate freeze would stem the tide of electricity undercollections, 
a sum the utilities realize is not necessarily collectible in the current 
political climate. 
""We have to fix these retail rates, which mask the true cost of electricity 
and which are creating the shortfall,"" said SDG&E President Edwin A. Guiles. 
In San Diego, for example, the average price paid by SDG&E customers zoomed 
from 11 cents per kilowatt-hour last year to 28 cents at its highest point 
this summer, before the Legislature stepped in to cap the rates, bringing the 
average price paid down to about 10 cents. 
So tinkering with the rate freeze could be politically hazardous. 
""The pain we saw in San Diego this summer is something we want to avoid for 
our customers in Northern and Central California,"" said PG&E spokesman Jon 
Tremayne. 
PG&E is expected soon to formally petition the state Public Utilities 
Commission to lift its rate freeze. The San Francisco-based utility argues 
that the $2.8-billion value of its Northern California hydroelectric 
properties, which under deregulation it is required to divest, would erase 
its stranded costs and make it eligible to pass along wholesale costs to 
consumers. 
Southern California Edison's chief financial officer, Jim Scilacci, said the 
utility could possibly be eligible to lift the rate freeze later this year if 
planned asset sales bring high enough prices. 
But with the legally mandated rate freeze in effect in San Diego, observers 
doubt that the state would let PG&E and Edison revert to market prices. 
In response, some consumer advocates are saying, in effect: Let the 
utilities, which ignored warnings of the electricity shortages at the root of 
the summer's price spikes, lie in the beds they made and pay the unforeseen 
costs of deregulation themselves. 
""Essentially this is the result of a deal gone wrong. It's buyer's remorse,"" 
said Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego 
watchdog group. ""The utilities cut a deal, and now they don't like the terms 
of the deal and they want out of it."" 
Somewhat more flexible is Ed Yates, senior vice president of the 
Sacramento-based California League of Food Processors, whose energy-intensive 
industry could be devastated by the full brunt of high wholesale energy 
costs. 
""What frightens us is that the utilities and the state could declare the rate 
freeze over and we'd have a San Diego situation,"" Yates said, referring to 
how the rising summer power costs made some San Diego County agricultural 
products noncompetitive. ""What we want is rate stability. But I don't see a 
solution. There are powerful interests at work who don't agree on the goal."" 
State officials are divided, with some including PUC President Loretta Lynch 
looking to the federal government to impose order. Gov. Gray Davis has 
discussed holding an energy summit next month to try to hash out solutions, 
but no date or agenda have been set. 
""The governor is obviously aware of the problems that California utilities 
are facing and continues to be committed to making deregulation work and is 
calling on everyone involved to act in a responsible way,"" said spokesman 
Steve Maviglio, adding that Davis has set aside much of October to work on 
the problem. 
Lynch made it clear she will be unreceptive to any solution that would have 
consumers absorbing all of the undercollections and that resolving the 
utilities' huge debts must come as part of a comprehensive overhaul of 
California's dysfunctional electricity market. 
""I don't think there is a simple solution. The utilities have a problem, I 
agree, but the resolution is much more complex than having the ratepayer eat 
the bill,"" Lynch said. ""The answer lies in a broader solution of addressing 
the wholesale energy market."" 
Unclear is how long Wall Street would wait for some kind of resolution before 
downgrading utilities' debt, the next step after the negative outlook 
revisions. 
""There are obviously many challenges presented to the power industry,"" said 
Standard & Poor's David Bodek. ""The costs are very high and at the end of the 
day have to be borne by someone. If it's the utilities, there are financial 
implications that could impact credit quality."" "

744,"Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must 
make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak 
demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with 
porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are 
working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The 
problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply 
enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated 
market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than 
prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and 
Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in 
California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the 
market.

It looks like we finally have a date to talk with some folks at EBS about

I've decided to settle for a conference  call. I hope you are available this 
Wednesday, May 3, 2000 at 3pm Houston time to speak with Matt Harris and some 
broadband folks.  If you can't make it don't sweat it but if you can that 
would be great!  The call should take no more than 1 1/2hrs.  Dial in 
instructions are as follows:

749,"Dick - In order to get the project moving, we are suggesting a pre-meeting 
with CSUF personnel and a subsequent (same day) meeting with PG&E. Next week 
is out for me, and I know that you are at Long Beach through the 19th of 
October. Let me know of your availability from the 20th on. 
You and Bob can determine who should attend from your side. Among other 
topics, we will be discussing the EIR issues, the construction site & 
schedule, and our day-to-day contact at CSUF. 
We are recommending a meeting at 9 AM with CSUF and a meeting after lunch 
with CSUF and PG&E. 
The Enron contingency will include Richard Crevelt, Implementation Manager; 
Rob Cone, the CSUF Substation Project Manager, Jeff Dasovich, Enron Corp 
Regulatory Affairs, and myself.
If Adrianne can make a conference room available and arrange for lunch at the 
faculty dining room, we can make this a very productive day indeed. Thanks,

All Parties -

We are re-sending this message from yesterday, regarding the February 7
meeting.  I apparently did something wrong with the addressing, and many of
the messages were ""returned to sender.""

I am re-sending it, just to be sure that everyone receives notice of the
February 7 meeting.

   CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOCUMENT
   PER CPUC RULE 51

INTERESTED PARTIES:

Based on discussions with a number of parties, we have determined that there
is general support for a one-day informational Gas Accord II Workshop on
Wednesday, February 7, 2001.

Accordingly, PG&E will host an informational meeting on February 7, in San
Francisco.  We have shortened the workshop, from two days to one very full
day, and will focus on the major issues and proposals.  Attached is our
suggested agenda with topics listed by their associated section in our
December 2000 comprehensive Settlement Proposal.

The February 7 Workshop will start at 9:00 a.m. and end around 5:00 p.m.  We
will be meeting at PG&E headquarters, in Conference Room 300, 77 Beale
Street, San Francisco.  We will not be providing lunch at this workshop due
to spending restrictions.  However, we hope to provide coffee and water.

At this point, we also would request that all parties to reserve February 21
and 22, 2001, on their calendars, for the next workshop and feedback
discussion on PG&E's December 2000 Settlement Proposal.

We look forward to meeting with those of you who can attend on February 7.
Also, we continue to be available at any Party's request to meet
individually to go over the December Settlement Proposal in detail.  Please
feel free to contact either of us, and we can make the necessary
arrangements.

we try and co-ordinate a conference call?

761,"I wanted to follow-up with everyone following yesterday's meeting. 

It appears to me that we need to develop (1) a better analysis of the four 
market models - AGL (Steve M), Columbia of Ohio (Janine), Socal Gas (Jeff), 
NICOR (Roy) - based on some key elements and (2) the key Influence parties in 
Illinois with 5 layer Influence Circles that we need to be thinking about in 
this discussion.

It would be great if we could get this to Laura for distribution by end of 
day Friday (realize it's tight).

Key elements for Market Models --

1. Direct Access Allowed?  For What customers?  What timeline?
2. Upstream Capacity resolution - assignment or otherwise?  Are there assets 
left to optimize
3. Retail pricing - Fixed price vs. PBR (how?) vs. something else?
4. Role of Wholesale Outsourcing Agent (would ENA sell to marketers or 
utilities or both?)
5. Other Issues

Thanks,

771,"Pact With PG&E Eluding Governor 
Power: Davis says obstacles include a debt that is double Edison's. Others 
cite an aggressive corporate culture as an impediment to state purchase of 
grid. 
By DAN MORAIN, NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers


?????WASHINGTON--As he attempts to finalize a settlement with Southern 
California Edison, Gov. Gray Davis said Monday that his effort to rescue a 
more recalcitrant Pacific Gas & Electric has been short-circuited by issues 
far more difficult than those raised by the state's other two ailing 
utilities. 
?????PG&E's debt could be as much as $8 billion, Davis indicated--twice the 
red ink of Edison, which Friday reached a preliminary agreement to sell its 
transmission lines to the state for $2.76 billion to pay off some of its 
staggering debt. Davis acknowledged that the Edison deal would mean nothing 
unless he was able to reach a twin pact with PG&E. 
?????Seasoned utility watchers see PG&E's stubborn negotiating posture as 
partly a bargaining ploy and partly the result of underlying business issues 
at the San Francisco company. 
?????Some cite a more aggressive corporate culture at PG&E than at Edison 
that has left PG&E alone on a precarious pinnacle, with bankruptcy on one 
side and partial dismembering by the state on the other. 
?????Brian Youngberg, senior utility analyst with the Edward Jones investment 
firm in St. Louis, said PG&E ""has historically pushed the envelope more in 
certain situations and that probably reflects their corporate culture. 
They're just sticking to their guns."" 
?????While Edison appears to have rejected bankruptcy law protection as an 
option, PG&E has not. 
?????Although Davis did not specify the size of PG&E's debt, he said it is 
""more than twice the size of Southern California Edison's."" As part of the 
deal between Davis and Edison, both sides agreed that the utility's debt is 
about $4 billion, sources close to the talks have said. 
?????""We are making progress"" with PG&E, said Davis, attending the annual 
National Governors Assn. conference in Washington, D.C. ""I want people to 
understand it is a far more complicated transaction. . . . It is just going 
to take a little longer."" 
?????Officials at PG&E and its parent, PG&E Corp., declined to publicly 
discuss the company's stance, citing the sensitivity of the negotiations. 
Company spokesman Ron Low said only that ""we expect to meet again this week. 
There was no time or date set yet."" 
?????San Francisco lawyer Michael Kahn, one of Davis' energy advisors, said 
the parties ""had contact over the weekend"" but he declined to elaborate. 
?????""We in the governor's office would very much like to reach arrangements 
with them and don't want to say anything in public that spoils the 
negotiations,"" he said. 
?????PG&E's hard-nosed bargaining stance is no surprise to Wall Street 
analysts and consumer advocates who have watched the utility's aggressive 
moves to shed its hydroelectric system, now blocked by state law, and to 
recoup past electricity and other costs. 
?????""It could be a negotiating tactic,"" said Lori Woodland, an analyst with 
Fitch Inc., the credit-rating firm that was the first to drop PG&E and 
Edison's debt to junk bond status. 
?????""PG&E has the largest piece of the pie"" in terms of uncollected 
electricity costs, Woodland said. ""It could also be just the thought of 
having to sacrifice their assets to pay for what ended up being flawed public 
policy."" 
?????Consumer advocate Michael Shames contends that PG&E might believe that a 
bankruptcy judge would allow the utility to sell some assets and restructure 
its debt in ways that would be preferable to anything the state is offering. 
?????""On the other hand, if Edison and [San Diego Gas & Electric] do sign on, 
then PG&E almost has to or risk the wrath of the governor and the Public 
Utilities Commission for the next seven years,"" said Shames, executive 
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. 
?????Edison is more comfortable in the role of regulated utility than is 
PG&E, said Mike Florio, a lawyer with the Utility Reform Network in San 
Francisco. 
?????""PG&E really seems to hate PUC regulation and wants to get as far away 
from it as it can, even if it means taking the company into the tank,"" said 
Florio, who is on the governing board of the California Independent System 
Operator, which runs the transmission grid owned by the three utilities. 
?????The utilities have amassed more than $12 billion in debt as they paid 
record sums for wholesale power last year, but were barred by state 
regulators from passing those costs on to California consumers of 
electricity. 
?????The level of debt is a fundamental part of the negotiations between the 
Davis administration and the three private utilities. At least part of that 
debt ultimately will be passed on to consumers. While Davis says he opposes 
rate hikes, his plan would restructure the rate system by propping up rates 
in the coming years, even as electricity costs may fall. 
?????Davis on Friday announced the outlines of an accord in which the state 
would buy Edison's share of the transmission grid for $2.76 billion. He said 
he hopes to make the deal final by week's end with Edison and Sempra, the 
parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric. 
?????Davis, meanwhile, is scheduled to meet today with U.S. Energy Secretary 
Spencer Abraham to outline his plan to take over the transmission grid. The 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must approve the state takeover of the 
grid, and FERC Chairman Kurt Hebert has been quoted recently as being 
skeptical of the plan. 
?????""Some people in Washington see this as more of an ideological 
statement,"" Davis said. ""As a governor, I see it as a practical solution. . . 
. Clearly, we have to persuade lots of people in Washington that what we're 
doing is the right thing."" 
?????Davis expressed optimism that the Bush administration would approve the 
transfer. Davis and other governors attending the conference met with the 
president for about 45 minutes at the White House on Monday. 
?????In his opening remarks, Bush repeated his desire to give the states more 
authority, saying ""real change comes from the states up."" 
?????Davis noted that he and other Western governors are hoping for federal 
aid to overhaul the transmission and distribution systems for electricity and 
natural gas system. 
?????""If we're going to have a strong economy,"" Davis said, ""we have to have 
the electricity to power it."" 
?????Davis, chairman of the Democratic Governors Assn., was scheduled to 
attend a $5.5-million fund-raiser Monday night for the Democratic governors 
in Washington. He will then leave for New York, where he will hold personal 
fund-raisers and confer with Wall Street analysts Wednesday about the state's 
energy situation. 
?????Meanwhile, Duke Energy North America on Monday suspended a lawsuit it 
had filed against Davis. The company said it reached an ""interim settlement"" 
to sell power to the state at the same below-market prices that it originally 
had agreed to supply to Edison and PG&E under long-term contracts. 
?????Duke sued the governor after he used emergency authority to seize the 
Duke contracts and similar contracts signed by other energy companies with 
the two utilities. Davis' action prevented the Power Exchange, the state's 
now defunct electricity market, from liquidating the contracts after Edison 
and PG&E defaulted on multimillion-dollar payments. 
?????The agreement reached Monday between Duke and the state expires April 
30, a Duke spokesman said, which should give the parties enough time to reach 
a more formal settlement. 
?????Power Exchange officials, however, are pressing ahead with their 
$1-billion claim against the state. Under California law, the state must pay 
reasonable value for private property seized under the governor's emergency 
authority.

772,"No.  The decision would have prevented the Commission from implementing the 
legislation that prohibits direct access, at least during the time that 
Legislature and the direct access coalition work together to try to come up 
with a compromise to continue to allow direct access.  So all this means is 
that the prohibition still has not been implemented and there currently is 
nothing before the commission to implement.  Sure would have been nice if the 
commission had passed it, though.

"
773,"LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Secretary of State Bill Jones has bolstered calls by top Republican legislators for an independent audit of the state's long-term energy contracts and purchases in the spot market. 

Such an audit could eventually lead to renegotiating some of the $44 billion in contracts signed by the California Department of Water Resources, Jones said at a press conference Monday. He was joined at the event by former California governor George Deukmejian. 

""Certainly it would be of benefit to the state based on the prices it paid to have some of those contracts renegotiated, though we have to follow the law like any other party,"" Jones said. 

In recent weeks, Jones has called on California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate possible conflicts of interest posed by consultants hired to negotiate contracts who also owned stock in energy companies. The state Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating the matter, and the federal Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating whether any stocks were traded by state employees using insider knowledge. The attorney general hasn't officially said if he is investigating. Under state law, energy contracts could be void if a conflict of interest was found to exist during their negotiation. 

""Some will say there are already many investigations underway, but a comprehensive audit conducted by an independent accounting firm is an entirely different matter,"" Jones said. ""The attorney general's office isn't trained and equipped, nor is it their responsibility to perform such a comprehensive business audit."" 

The CDWR, which started buying power in January in lieu of the state's three cash-strapped utilities, has come under fire in recent weeks for buying too much power under long-term contracts and for locking in market-peak prices for up to 20 years. The CDWR has signed $44 billion in long-term deals and spent about $9 billion on spot purchases. 


Senate, Assembly Republican Leaders Request Audit 


Jones, who hopes to run against Gov. Gray Davis next year, said he supports a letter sent by Republican leaders to State Controller Kathleen Connell in mid-July requesting that she arrange an audit of the state's energy spending. 

The letter, sent by Senate Minority Leader James Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, and Assembly Minority Leader Dave Cox, R-Sacramento, asks that Connell consider arranging and paying for an outside consulting firm to determine if power contracts and purchases were prudent and if they will necessitate electricity rate hikes. 

Connell's office verified that she received the letter and said she was preparing a response. 

""We're responding to all the questions in the letter; we are definitely answering the questions. Check in later this week,"" said Lisa Casalegno, Connell's press secretary. 

The letter, a copy of which has been obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, singles out two topics in addition to prudence and rate hikes. Those topics include how the price of energy was calculated and whether or not energy consultants pose a conflict of interest. 

According to the letter: ""How does the Administration arrive at the price of energy purchased through the long-term contracts? Are these figures inclusive of variable factors that can impact the potential price of energy? What is the true cost for the consultants with whom the Administration has contracted for electricity purchases? What oversight and accountability precautions have been taken to ensure that there is no conflict of interest?."" 

Connell has said in recent months that she fears the state's energy purchases will jeopardize its general fund as well as prospects for a $12.5 billion revenue bond sale in October to fund long-term power contracts. Last week, Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, asked the Assembly to hold immediate oversight hearings to investigate the state's energy-related activities, saying he had ""serious concerns regarding several of the administration's actions."" 


Governor's Office, CDWR Say Audit Unnecessary 


A CDWR spokesman dismissed calls for an audit as being politically motivated, noting that spot-market power prices have declined markedly since the contracts were signed. 

""We're in a good position: we've avoided blackouts this summer and we have a reliable injection of energy, and that was our goal,"" Oscar Hidalgo said. ""Everyone's trying to turn over a rock, but the bottom line is, we're seeing a market that's been well in control since June."" 

Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio agreed that an audit wasn't needed. 

""These have been the most scrutinized contracts the state has ever entered into,"" Maviglio said. ""Besides, as a matter of course there will already be an audit for all CDWR spending by the State Auditor's office.""

SBX 78 (Polanco) - The Governor's office called a meeting earlier today of
the business community to discuss a strategy for moving SBX 78 out of
Appropriations and off of the Assembly floor.  The Governor asked that the
business community try to get support from Republicans.  Assemblyman
Leonard, who was the lone Republican to vote for the bill yesterday, is
meeting with Republicans now to try and get their support.  It is widely
held that his rationale for voting for the bill was because he was concerned
that if the bill did not get out in its current form, liberal Democrats
would have amended the bill to look more like the original bill. This is
likely the reason why they need Republicans now.  Assembly session begins at

Astronomical damage awards set a bad precedent

?		?		?
?		MODESTO, Calif. - Now high is up? ?
		?
		That's the  question that thousands of giddy personal injury lawyers are 
asking  themselves in the wake, of two astronomical punitive damage awards 
handed  out by California juries within three days of each other in July.  ?
		?
		In one of the judgments, Modesto jurors ordered Ford  Motor Co. to pay $290 
million in punitive damages to a young man whose  mother, father and brother 
were killed when he tipped over his 1978 Bronco  on Father's Day 1993. ?
		?
		At the time of the accident,  Juan Ramon Romo, then 19, had been driving for 
a lengthy period of time,  so long, in fact, that everyone else in the Bronco 
- his mother and  father, a brother and two sisters had fallen asleep. Going 
slightly over  the speed limit on an interstate highway, Romo attempted 
illegally to pass  another vehicle on the right. ?
		?
		When the other driver  decided to move back into the right lane, Romo swerved 
left and rolled  over. His mother, father and brother were killed; he and his 
two sisters  survived. ?
		?
		The $290 million judgment in the Romo case  was the second largest ever 
entered against a U.S. car manufacturer, yet  it received little media 
attention outside the immediate Modesto area.  ?
		?
		Hardly surprising, perhaps, since only three days  before a Las Angeles jury 
had set the punitive damage bar impossibly high  by ordering General Motors 
to pay a staggering punitive damage award of  $4.9 billion. ?
		?
		By way of a yardstick, that amount  surpasses the combined Gross National 
Product of Afghanistan and Albania.  Almost obscured by the astonishing 
generosity of the jurors in Los Angeles  and Modesto, was a salient point 
that still sends shivers through  corporate defense lawyers around the 
country: By any objective criteria,  neither Ford nor General Motors appeared 
to bear any responsibility for  the accidents. ?
		?
		In the Los Angeles case, Patricia  Anderson, her four children and a family 
friend were stopped at a red  light in her 1979 Chevy Malibu on Christmas Eve 
1993. A drunken driver  traveling at 70 mph slammed his car into the Malibu's 
rear end. The  collision ruptured the Malibu's gas tank and ignited the 
spilled fuel.  Mrs. Anderson's four children suffered severe burns.  ?
		?
		When police tested the drunken driver he registered a  blood alcohol content 
of 0.20 - twice the legal limit for drivers in  California. ?
		?
		Similarly, in the Modesto case, driver  error and misjudgment on the part of 
Romo clearly appeared to be the cause  of the accident. ?
		?
		But Romo's lawyer, Lawrence Drivon,  immediately blamed the deaths on the 
Bronco, which he said was susceptible  to rollover, and had a defectively 
designed roof. ?
		?
		Yet  the Bronco exceeded all federal safety standards for roof strength in 
1978  by more than 100 percent and, in fact, exceeds the 1999 standard by 
more  than 30 percent. ?
		?
		Romo's Bronco also exceeded all  federal rollover standards for 1978 model., 
and federal accident data show  the Ford Broncos rollover rate was no higher 
than that of other SUVs.  ?
		?
		It's open to question whether the Bronco had been  properly maintained prior 
to the accident. The vehicle had been on the  road for 15 years, had numerous 
changes in ownership and had nearly  200,000 miles on the odometer. ?
		?
		In addition, Drivon  engaged in conduct that borders on jury tampering - 
mailing to each juror  a copy of his book, 'The Civil War on Consumer 
Rights,"" whose main thesis  is that large American corporations, like Ford, 
are attempting to close  ""the courthouse doors"" to average Americans by 
pressing for judicial  reforms. In the book, Drivon devotes an entire chapter 
to Ford's alleged  misdeeds. ?
		?
		In part because of Drivon's behavior, a  California judge granted Ford's 
motion to set aside the punitive damage  part of the verdict and ordered a 
new trial. Among other things, he cited  improper discussions among the 
jurors that prejudiced deliberations.  ?
		?
		But Ford could be entering double jeopardy with a new  trial. Drivon has 
indicated he will seek to raise the initial punitive  award threefold to more 
than $1 billion. With a sympathetic jury, that  could happen. ?
		?
		Damage award, of a few hundred million  here and a few hundred million there 
are still unusual, but California is  a national trendsetter. ?
		?
		If juries elsewhere start  emulating the ones in Los Angeles and Modesto, our 
now booming economy  could well begin to sputter. ?

Because the prices are based on L3Day NYMEX prices, when two out of three

risk for November.  [For your information but not for the filing - We have a 
big position for November so we need to get this pushed off until December or 
we could lose alot of money].
By basing the caps on heat rates from 1999, the ISO assumed that this was the 
proper test period.  This is not a good test year given that generators lost 
alot of money in 1999.

813,"Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must 
make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak 
demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with 
porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are 
working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The 
problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply 
enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated 
market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than 
prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and 
Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in 
California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the 
market.

816,"Jeff,

Attached is a file that contains an analysis that Bob Badeer asked me to do 
for you.  The results are displayed on the ""graphs"" page in two graphs:

1. This (top) graph shows a typical portfolio that the utility might want to 
use to cover its short position.  I have displayed here a representative 
average monthly peak load shape for the year (it is acutally the CAISO avg 
peak load for the previous 12 months).  We have assumed that the utility has 
available 15GW of capacity (""utility-owned resources""), and that the 
remainder will be served through one of four types of contracts: a 10-yr 
fixed price, a 5-year fixed price, a 1-yr fixed price, or ""monthly"" prices 
(i.e., spot or balance of the month type prices).  We have then allocated the 
net short position among these four contracts in varying amounts, assuming 
that the utility would not want to be over-exposed to any one term.

2.  This (bottom) graph shows peak prices (using an average of NP and SP) for 
the next five years (1) for the four contracts listed above (""Monthly"" is 
simply our forward curve) and (2) for a weighted average price assuming the 
allocation shown in the first graph.  We note that we have assumed a cost to 
generate for the utility's resources of $40/Mwh.

Hope this is somewhat clear.  If you have any questions, please call me at 
503-464-8671.  Thanks.

817,"I recommend reading CAISO's response.  This letter was reported in last

I am told that BPA does not consider this letter confidential even though it 
is labeled as such by CAISO.

Many of the  CAISO ""backpedal"" statements made re: claims of strategic 
bidding would apply equally to other importers.

818,"Appeals court declines to order energy price caps


Updated: May 29, 2001 - 12:22 p.m.
SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court declined Tuesday to order federal
energy regulators to cap wholesale electricity prices.

The decision by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
came hours before California Gov. Gray Davis was to urge President Bush in
Century City to cap wholesale power costs, which have been spiraling out of
control.

The panel, in a brief statement, said last week's appeal by state Senate
President John Burton and state Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg does not
warrant ""intervention of this court.""

The lawmakers, both Democrats, were joined by the city of Oakland in their
appeal to the 9th Circuit.

""The citizens of California are suffering immediate irreparable harm as a
result of FERC's abrogation of its duty to establish just and reasonable
rates for electricity,"" they wrote to the 9th Circuit, which has
jurisdiction over FERC.

The lawmakers said California's looming threat of continued blackouts ""are
an imminent threat to the health, welfare and safety of every California
citizen.""

The suit came after more than a year of wholesale power prices reaching
historically high levels. In December, prices in California reached $200 per
megawatt hour -- and they have skyrocketed to as much as $1,900 per megawatt
hour during peak times since then.

The Bush administration ardently opposes price caps and President Bush has
declined Davis' requests to urge FERC to impose strict caps.

Vice President Dick Cheney, chief architect of the administration's energy
plan, has said capping prices would not increase energy supplies or reduce
demand.

""We get politicians who want to go out and blame somebody and allege there
is some kind of conspiracy ... instead of dealing with the real issues,""
Cheney has said.

Cheney criticized Davis, a Democrat, for what he called a ""harebrained
scheme"" to use the state's budget surplus to buy power because California's
two largest utilities face enormous financial problems.

For the short term, the Bush administration has approved Davis' request to
expedite permits for new power plants and has ordered federal facilities in
California to reduce energy consumption 10 percent this summer.

Sacramento and the White House appear locked in a high-voltage war of
rhetoric over energy policies. There is broad bipartisan dissatisfaction in
Sacramento with Washington's response to California's energy crisis -- the
result of its own 1996 deregulation rules.

Last month FERC did order a one-year cap on electricity sold into California
during power emergencies, when power reserves fall below 7 1/2 percent. The
agency did not set a price and also required the state to join a regional
transmission organization, which could limit California's ability to control
its own power grid.

Davis called the plan a ""Trojan horse,"" and state power regulators dismissed
the cap as inadequate, saying it would profit power generators at
ratepayers' expense.

In addition, Davis and state lawmakers sharply criticized FERC for
considering requiring the state's power grid operator to add a surcharge on
power sales to pay generators the money they are owed by the state's two
large financially strapped utilities.

The case is Burton v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 01-70812.

833,"""The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San 
Diego"" (April 2001) 
PWP-082 by James B. Bushnell and Erin T. Mansur
Retail electricity rates in the San Diego Gas & Electric service territory 
more than doubled over a period of three months during the summer of 2000. 
Much of this increase was subsequently rescinded through a retroactive rate 
freeze. We examine the impact of these events on overall consumption levels 
in San Diego. We find that average electricity consumption decreased by 
roughly 55 MW, or 1.6%, between mid-July and the end of August. Demand was 
reduced by over 6% in the late afternoon and late evening. Because of the 
uncertainty about the duration and the credibility of the rate increase, 
these results should be viewed as a lower bound on the demand reductions that 
could be achieved through pricing incentives.

846,"Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt 
Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief
Thursday, May 31, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/31/M
N231235.DTL 
Sacramento -- Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern 
California Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at 
the expense of its biggest customers. 
The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial 
customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion 
back debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users 
would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt. 
Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but 
supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and 
should shoulder the costs it created. 
""We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these 
problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any 
problems,"" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). 
Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put 
Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help 
restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency. 
Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP 
lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt. 
The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into ""core"" and 
""noncore"" users. 
SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS
Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core 
users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would 
be those using more than 500 kilowatts. 
Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers. 
But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy. 
Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long- 
term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar 
panels, on contract with the utility. 
That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of 
the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of 
electricity. 
Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to 
buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to 
make themselves energy self-sufficient. 
The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy 
customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market. 
During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users 
would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would 
shift exclusively to the big users. 
Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be 
given what is called ""direct access"" to generators so they can negotiate 
cheaper rates. 
Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users 
because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells. 
Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so. 
EDISON 'ENCOURAGED'
Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out 
details of the plan. 
A spokesman for Edison said he was ""encouraged"" by the talks. 
""I haven't seen a finished product or a plan,"" said Bob Foster, a senior vice 
president with Edison. ""They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and 
trying to find a solution."" 
Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there 
is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity. 
""We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will 
experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years,"" said D.J. Smith, a 
lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. 
""When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another 
potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy,"" 
Smith said. 
Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and 
Technology Association: ""What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying 
the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. 
They don't want voters to pay because they vote."" 
CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 
said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business 
interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto 
residential and smaller commercial customers. 
""I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public 
Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big 
business end up costing more for residential and small businesses,"" 
Rosenfield said. 
The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of 
the transmission system that loops electricity around the state. 
Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that 
for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value. 
Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state 
purchase of transmission lines. 
In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the 
transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset. 
In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to 
either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, 
for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

850,"Most folks probably listened in to the press conference, but for those that 
didn't here's a summary of the ISO's proposal to FERC.  The description of 
the proposal was vague and general, and Winters tends to speak in run-on 
sentences, so if I've gotten anything wrong, please chime in.

$100 cap for ""old"" generation; ""new"" generation would be exempt.
FERC would require generators and SCs to contract forward for at least 70% of 
their power.
For those that meet the 70% requirement, they will be exempt from the $100 
cap, and the $250 cap will apply.
Winters believes that the 70% requirement, coupled with utility-controled 
gen, will result in the IOUs scheduling about 85% of load into the forward 
market.
Load and supply that deviate from schedules and go to the real time market 
will be penalized (details to be ""ironed"" out).

The ISO is supposed to make the filing at FERC today."

858,"FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like ""they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?""  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the ""unnamed sources"" sort, ""industry sources"" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me ""are there any alternatives to deal with this mess.""  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the ""green only"" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.

"
869,"With the first round of RTO filings and responses complete, it is a good time 
to step back and review the highs and lows that occurred in 2000 and lay out 
our plan going into 2001. 

A. 2000 Key Facts --

1. FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS.

It does not appear that FERC (in its current form) will modify its standing 
policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let 1,000 
flowers bloom.  While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a 
different position, we have seen no signals that anything will change.  Faced 
with this policy, as the initial RTO filings made clear, almost all utilities 
are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic 
transmission assets.  Accordingly, most of the proposed RTOs do not remove 
the fundamental problem - the Native Load exception.

2. THE MIDWEST CAN'T MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST.

The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO.  The three big 
utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd, 
IP, and Ameren (probably 40% of total load in initial MISO).   Key problems 
for the MISO include (a) MISO's not-for-profit status (key IP claim), (b) 
parties interest in taking energy east (key ComEd need), and (c) fair 
retention of 3rd party wheeling revenues (Ameren want).    Meetings with 
regional stakeholders (public power, industrials, State PUCs) have been 
productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred 
option, however we await action from the FERC.  MISO is also telling everyone 
that can listen that if the big three pull out, it probably won't continue.  
While the MISO process is very open to the public (not so with the Alliance 
RTO), neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the 
details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met.

3. SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED - NOTHING.

Rather than take a major step forward, Southern and Grid South (SCANA, CP&L, 
Duke) have initially filed non-compliant RTOs.  Grid South does nothing to 
advance a market, much less provide transmission service in a 
non-discriminatory fashion.  In fact, Grid South simply takes the current 888 
OATT and ""combines"" the three utilities for wheeling through purposes.  

4. PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERC'S SHINING LIGHT.

PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was 
necessary (rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the ""right 
example"").  PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order 2000 in 
that filing.  PJM is also expanding.  So far, Allegheny Power and DQE have 
agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called 
PJM West.  In terms of market coordination, PJM has been publicly reluctant 
to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools (PJM, 
NYISO,  NE-ISO, and Ontario IMO).   The other pools are not getting very much 
accomplished in their efforts.  For example, NE-ISO has indicated that it 
won't have the Day-Ahead market ready until 2003 at the earliest.  

5. ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME.

ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail 
access (pilot program beginning next summer).  The rules are still being 
structured.  We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines don't 
overwhelm good market structure.   Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading 
our efforts and are very active.  

6. SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG

In a surprise move, the actions so far in Grid Florida, while certainly not 
perfect, appear to be moving in the right direction.  The FL PSC has gone 
from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right.  
Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during 
this Legislative session; Enron will be involved.

B. 2001 Steps - 

1. FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION.

FERC will have new leadership some time in early 2000 (if we can get a 
President).  Enron is developing a coordinated political plan (Capitol Hill, 
media, Administration, industry allies) to impress upon the next 
Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue 
to drive wholesale market reforms.  Without a stronger mandate, it may prove 
difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of 2001.  More importantly, it 
will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail 
wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight.  In those RTOs 
that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception, no 
amount of meetings or filings will change the parties.

2. COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK.

It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to 
ensure that Enron's objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs.  
The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to 
coordinate day-to-day activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no 
opportunity is missed.  This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs 
of the commercial teams.   We continue to have at least one person dedicated 
to each RTO market.

NYISO   -  Howard Fromer
NE-ISO  -  Dan Allegretti
IMO   - Aleck Dadson
PJM  - Tom Hoatson
MISO/Alliance - Jeff Brown / Dave Mangskau
Grid South - Tom Chapman / Joe Connor
Southern  - Joe Connor
Florida  - Dan Staines
SPP  - Ron McNamara
ERCOT  - Robin Kittel

Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out.  
Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June / July to also work on wholesale 
market issues.

3. PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS.

NE-ISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January 
15, 2001.  While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration 
matters, not much progress has been made to date.  Moving power between the 
pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling 
rules.  FERC is aware of these problems.  Again, FERC has not done anything 
to mandate compliance with Order 2000.  We have deployed an additional 
resource in Houston recently to help support Enron's involvement in the tight 
pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all 
developments as close to real-time as possible.

4. CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES.

The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for 
ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO.  We continue to 
advocate our agenda (to anyone that will listen).   This work is time 
consuming (much spent listening to ""junk"" from monopolist Transmission 
Owners) and detailed.  Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs 
initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our 
resources.

5. FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT e-trans.

Project e-trans has resulted in a new business consortium - 
etransconsortium.com.  This combination of APX, Cal PX, and Alstom ESCA has 
developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the ""market 
front-end"" for any RTO (e.g., day-ahead market, transmission exchange, 
etc.).  Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates 
our policy objectives.  We are now turning our attention to finding the right 
Grid Operator.  We are in discussions with National Grid, American 
Transmission Company, MISO, and PJM (although they may want to do something 
very similar).  The goal remains the same -- to have a fully functioning 
entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use 
this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action.  I will be taking 
a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in 2001.

6. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION 
DIVESTITURE

Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets 
through direct access and divestiture.  It will take (1) non-discriminatory 
transmission access, (2) retail choice, and (3) generation divestiture to 
enable a fully thriving wholesale market.  Of course, additional market 
openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California.

I hope this helps put some framework around our activities.  If anyone wants 
to discuss this in more detail, I'd be happy to meet individually or as a 
group.

Markets towards building the paper and steel commodity markets and less so on 
the outsourcing product, I just wanted your opinion on whether this is a deal 
we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed.  I 
believe that Rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other 
priorities they would like to transition the deal to EES.  Ultimately, the 
value (TCV, earnings, up-sell, resume) would benefit Enron more in EES than 
ENA.

potential value of this company.

I don't see it in the best interests of Enron to be transferring assets below 
a reasonable market value between business units.  You can trust that I will 
be keeping the Energy Capital Resources team's feet to the fire on the 
realization of this value if you do not purchase the company.

(I'm confused!)"
914,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

932,"I think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in Desk assignments 
and responsibilities.  With that said, I am listing some of the current 
issues that I have seen, that will need to be addressed quickly.  Most of 
these issues are none of my business, but since I see unpathed gas I thought 
you two might want to dicsuss these issues.

Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we 
stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get 
this assigned?  I can find old
   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let 
me know.

Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for 
ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1.

MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and 
Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with 
transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it 
stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I 
thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.

Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:

 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left 
unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed 
appropriately.  Someone
  needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, 
that were nominated for January.

 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This 
issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot 
allocate was is
  not pathed and nominated.  

 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point 
specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 
10,000).  This is a pathed    pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the 
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this 
transaction, we are not legally covered.    Carlos was handling this pipe in 
Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan?

HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December 
and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back 
next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return.



Pat  -   The following  was my recollection of the assignments for Dec 1 to 
the present.  You might want to confirm with Mary Smith and then you can 
proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned 
issues.

Hank Eisenhours duties were split :

Mandey -   Handle all long term HPLC expense issues:  undeveloped contracts, 
December flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues.

Carlos  -  All offsystem transactions for ENA and HPLC in Unify and all 
offsystem paper and electronic noms on Intrastate Pipes.  Ami and Stacey
  also handle some.  There is a lot of confusion here.  I found unpathed gas 
for December.  We'll need to address this one quickly.

HPL Transports were all split by zone.  Each Logistics rep is responsible for 
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in Unify.

HPL Operational seems to be left unassigned. 

I think most of the desk assumed that Carlos took over Hanks 
responsibilities.  The assignments above are my recollection only."

937,"FYI

This is a reduction in total capacity from 528,000 to 400,000 at Station 809.

HPL has typically been running about 180,000 to 200,000 mmbtu through Station 
809 in August.  We can pull more gas off of the A-S line at Swan Lake to keep 
our throughput around the 175,000.  

My original conversation with EPFS was that the capacity would be limited to 
around 400,000 mmbtu total during the maintenance.  Station 809 will be down 
through the weekend and we will get a better picture of how much we can move 
without 809 running.  I will visit with EPFS on Monday and see if we can get 
the volume bumped up (to 400,000) and adjust on Tuesday as necessary.

If you have any questions please call.  36449.

955,"How bout getting me on a Wed PM flight to Hou. on Jan 10 and back to Omaha on 
the Fri afternoon flight on the 12th?  I need to be in Houston at the office 
until at least 3:00--can I still get a flight better than the late one?  DF"
956,"I note in TW's bullets for 12-22 that TW did the ""Cal Border Backhaul"" deal 
with SW Gas.  The last I heard about it, the deal had cratered.  I had 
serious reservations about doing the deal as it was initially described to 
me, which included a Cal border sale of ""surplus"" gas and a backhaul for EES 
on behalf of SW Gas.  My probems were (1) the issue of possible or apparent 
affiliate preference and (2) the need for adequate documentation of ""surplus 
line pack.""   My last guidance was that a deal like this might be doable, but 
only if we could document the ""surplus"" and if Stan signed off on it.  What 
happened?  Does the deal involve EES???  Was that raised with Stan and 
Danny?  The bullets don't mention the identity of the ""shipper"" that the 
backhaul was done for.  Please respond.  DF "
957,"As I understand the situation, Plains and Tri-State have indicated their 
intent to close the merger.  Tim's best intelligence is that a June 1 closing 
date is the best they can hope for and it may be late June or later.  Also,  
until the deal actually closes, there is always a small chance it could come 
undone.  If we get Gallup in service May 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust 
between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in.  
Has Courtney got this covered?  I suspect he's been thrashing around so much 
on locking in the swap that it hasn't been on his radar screen.  

I think we should formally notify ECS that we expect them to negotiate a 
favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and 
the merger closing.  (the difference between the $.038 and .067 rate was 
about $200,000/ month as I recall, so this is worth some real $$$)  Also, we 
ought to remind Courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for 
us if the merger goes south for some reason.  I drafted a letter  awhile back 
that could be updated for this purpose.  Susan, assuming Steve and company 
agree, could you follow up on this (I'm having Martha email it to you).  The 
contract requires us to notify ECS by March 1.  Thanks.  DF

961,"In our pre-filing discussion, we explained the awarding of call options as 
follows:

Because call options are only sold after we have tried to sell the underlying 
capacity and there were no takers at max. rate or an acceptable price, there 
is really only 1 variable -- the total rate (consisting of the option 
component and the strike price).

The call option is posted for a specific quantity, start date, etc.  There 
are no other variables.  It's just price.

From our discussions with Mike Coleman and crew on this topic -- I think is 
it absolutely key that we keep the award variables to a minimum.  My take is 
that the transmittal letter referring to highest price is the right way to 
go.  The concept in the tariff about posting the evaluation criteria 
(implying that there are more variables) could kill the deal.

978,"I read Wednesday's NGPL order (RP00-18-002) as applying only to NGPL due to 
their unique restrictions and tariff rules.  I do not read it as forcing the 
rest of the industry (i.e., us) to use the floor rate as the reserve price 
for negotiated index rate bids and ordinary recourse rate bids.  I think we 
can still determine the reserve price on a prearranged deal like the ENA deal 
based on our good faith valuation of the upside provided by the index 
mechanism.  I.e., on that type of deal, we can determine that the index 
mechanism is worth ""x cents"" to us and require a discounted recourse rate 
bidder to bid more than the floor plus x cents to win.  Agreed?  

Note that NGPL whined that the unique rules they are subject to place them at 
a competitve disadvantage to the rest of the industry (i.e., us) on this 
issue.  The commission didn't say anything about that, implying to me that 
the rest of us are still free to do what NGPL cannot do.   DF  "

"
1009,"The attached files contains our daily volume requirements for 7/6 and  the
following day(s) as listed .    In each file there are three  worksheets
labelled as follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\July00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':

Please note that for the month of July '00 CES is purchasing additional 
volumes
of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate deal.  The
volumes shown here are entirely separate from the aforementioned deal.

1033,"Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."""

I don't have any firm bids but I have the following information.  

In order for Sequent to purchase gas from us they require some sort of legal document showing that Enron has title to the gas.  She won't be able to purchase gas from us until next week.  Their notional bid for gas at the hub is Nymex - $0.03.  

I received Oxy's gisb contract this afternoon and have forwarded it on to legal for review and comments.  I ask for a notional quote this afternoon.  My contact had told me he would have a notional quote this afternoon.  However, he has been in meetings since 2:00.  I will call back tomorrow.  They have inquired if they could by the gas in the ground and manage the transportation agreement so they would have the daily flexibility.  I told them I didn't think that was possible but I would check.  I also told him that we could possibly offer some daily flexibility with a daily deadline.

That's today's news.

1035,"Just a few comments on the new letter to Bridgeline:

In Paragraph 2, ""reasonable efforts"" can often lead to additional disputes when actually administrating the gas deal, such as price arbitrage between Bridgeline's price and the spot gas market prices.  Could we add some flexibility to sell that inventory in-place to a third party so that additional fuel and injection fees will not be deducted from the third party's bid?  Bridgeline waiver to other transport claims could be a problem unless Bridgeline just agrees to cash-out the transport imbalances at the NYMEX - $0.05 price, otherwise they will want us to transport at least the 6,212 Dth of interruptible transport imbalance gas to a delivery point.  How about using the following:

	...ENA will attempt to remove its gas from Bridgeline storage or arrange for an in-ground transfer of the storage inventory during the month of July....Bridgeline agrees to purchase residual gas and cash-out ENA's firm and interruptible transportation imbalances in accordance....

Also in Paragraph 3, instead of confirmation numbers the numbers are actually contract numbers (i.e. used three times).

Call me if there are any questions,

"
1038,"I had a letter that needed to be sent out today so I left early.  This is what I need and you can tell me what the process is.

ENA purchased gas from TDC (sitara #1143983) in the month of December 2001 on NGPL.  It appears that we scheduled the gas on an NGPL IT agreement to the NGPL LA Pool.  At the pool, it appears that we made some sales 
	Deal 1184526 Cornerstone Propane, L.P.
	Deal 1184587 MidAmerican Energy Company
	Deals 258085 and 315861 to Enron MW, L.L.C.  - desk to desk deals.

Did Cornersone pay ENA for the gas?
Did MidAmerican pay ENA for the gas?
How do these desk to desk deals work?
Did any of this goes go to cash out or did ENA go short and cash out?

Not a rush but I would like to have an answer by next Friday if possible.

Thanks

Chris,
Please call me once you have looked at these questions and let me know
what additional questions we should ask Dominion.  Thanks.

1041,"I am in receipt of several faxes from Dominion Transmission Inc which inform Enron of DTI's intention of not crediting gas from listed meters/producers to Enron's pool.  Per Dan Baney of DTI, the listed effective dates are dates as of which gas will not be credited.  In some cases, they are taking back gas previously allocated to the pool. 

While DTI is asking for a signoff from Enron agreeing to these statements, we have not sent any back.  I have forwarded all of these to you for handling along with the many other issues between Enron, DTI, and the affected producers.

1042,You're right Chris; Dominion is charging .0721 for parking.
1043,"Bill agreed to provide us this information during the Dominion conference call.  I think we knew most of this, except that another penalty refund is going to need to be addressed.

Shemin, I forgot to flag the language in one of the Asset Management sale agreements that we just copied that talks about waiver of claims and who needs to pay in the future.  Sorry.  This agreement may change the VNG refund decision that we talked about a few days ago.

1044,"Rita,

I am told that Sonat indicates that we owe them at least $879,000 for October 2001. The values you provided do not indicate this large amount. Can you please verify and let me know.

1045, 
1046,"To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

1049,"Heidi, the volume of 100dth on k65403 to CGV1-34 is being cut because of 
capacity allocation at mkt-34, you do not have any primary contracts to that 
area.  Please call Chris Germany for more information.

 - Press Release -- CES-NPC                     063000.doc"
1058,"Introduction

In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide, we have 
upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we 
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your 
products.

This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days. 
Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade.

Summary of New Features

Multiple Children - A ""Child"" product can be the ""Parent"" of another Child 
(multiple links in a chain) and different types of links can be placed 
against a single Parent.

Static Product Bar Prices - When you change a price in the Product Bar and 
hit the ""+"" or ""-"" button, the price stays - it does not reset to the amount 
in Product Properties until you logout.

Sorting - You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on 
the title of the field. For multiple sorts, hold down your ""shift"" key.

Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis 
relationship identified. (e.g. The Product bar might before have said: ""Basis 
Link - Parent"" and now would say ""Stand Alone, Parent"").


Detailed Feature Descriptions


Multiple Children

The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together 
in a long chain. For example, Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product 
B, which is in turn linked to Parent Product C.

Warning: Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a 
chain, system performance is degraded by large chains. This is because when a 
customer attempts a transaction, the database must ""lock"" each and every 
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request. The 
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the 
locks. ""Vertical"" chains (multiple parents and children in one long link) are 
much slower to process than ""Flat"" chains (One parent with many children). 
Large vertical chains should be avoided. 

Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the 
same parent. For example, Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent 
Product B. At the same time, Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link 
to the same Parent Product B. Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated 
Basis link and a regular Basis Link.


Static Product Bar Prices

The new version of EnronOnline provides for ""sticky"" Product Bar price and 
volume changes. When you change a number on the Product Bar, it does not 
reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you 
have logged out. This makes it easier to update prices, volumes, spreads or 
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the ""+"" or ""-"" buttons. 

One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it 
reduces repeated price movements. With the old version of Stack Manager, if 
the price delta was too small, traders would often repeatedly hit the price 
movement buttons. Each of these price changes must be communicated across the 
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth. This makes it harder 
for customers to transact with us - each time they try, a new price update 
moves the price, resulting in an increased transaction failure rate. Entering 
an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price 
movement button means that fewer (but larger) price movements are necessary, 
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure 
rate.

You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices - a new field 
for Offset to Last Trade. This allows you to update the offset for Products 
which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu.


Sorting/Selecting

The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting 
functionality over the old. You can now choose any field heading (Type, 
Location, Reference Period,  etc.) and sort by that item. You can do multiple 
sorts by holding down the shift key. Example: If you select Type and then 
Location while holding the shift key, you will see your products sorted first 
by Product Type and then within each Product Type, by Location (in 
alphabetical order).

If you right click on the Product menu, you can choose from the same sort 
criteria, plus you can select ""Sort by Web Order"", which allows you to see 
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the 
website (note however, that a customer on the website might be also seeing a 
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing).

When you select products, you can drag your mouse while holding down the left 
mouse button as always, but now you can also hold down the <ctrl> key while 
making your selections. This allows you to highlight products which are not 
necessarily adjacent to one another.


Parent Products and F/X Products

One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its 
treatment of how parent products are displayed. The old version showed the 
type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar (to the left of 
the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs). The new version 
does not show the type of link. This is because the new version allows for 
more than one type of link on each parent product.

Some traders may notice that  their  products which have f/x links are now 
identified with a stylised ""fx"" in the Product list. This is to enable easy 
identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the 
parent, rather than managed individually.



Assistance

As always, if you have any problems with any EnronOnline functionality, 
please contact the 24 hour Help Desk (Houston: 713 853 4357, London: +44 (0) 
20 7783 7783, Australia: +61 2 9229 2300).


General Feedback

If you have any comments on the new functionality, or suggestions for further 
functionality, please call David Forster on 713 853 1861. If you had 
previously suggested new functionality which didn't make it into this 
release, rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard 
to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your 
requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager.

1067,"Chris,

What's going on?  I just got back from a much needed spring break -- I spent
a few days in Cancun -- what a place!  Nashville's been treating me pretty
well.  I've been seeing this one girl up here for a while.  She's really
nice, but I'm sure that it's only going to be a short-term thing.  How about
you?  Are you still seeing Ingrid?

Have you been going out much with Jim and Merideth?  Well, hopefully you're
still keeping up with the singles scene, because I'm going to be spending
the summer in Houston, and I'll need a drinking partner -- preferrably
somebody who's as much of a light-weight as I am.

Let me know how everything is going.  I should start work the 21st of May,
and I'll give you a call when I get into town.

Talk to you later,

Chad

Actually it is not a new truck.  Had 33,000 miles, Ram 2500 3/4 ton, 4 x 4,
360 Magnum Motor.  Infinity stereo, bucket seats, nerf bars, tool box, bed
liner, camper tow package, 5 speed manual.  Oh, it is dueled out through one
catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound.  Makes me want to
race!!!  I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well.  Now,
Debbie wants it.  I gave $16,900 + tax.  It is very clean and is Sandalwood,
Driftwood or something of that nature in color.  Almost silver.  I have to
pick up old gray over at Jerry's.  Debbie said, it is going to be hard on me
to sale my old dodge truck.  I said Yep, had that truck longer than I have
had most of my women.  I really need to engage brain before articulating!  I
am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before
rain.  One thing is for sure, the economy is not faltering on my account.
Dow Stock is back up over $33.  Hooray, hoorah!
Needs to go to $41 and then I will be happy.  I spoke with Gerald and he
said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad's place.  We need to
change the lock and place posted signs at the gate.  I may want to put some
steers or heifers up there.  I am going up soon and having the tractor
fixed.  Reggie said he will pay us soon.  He also still wants the tractor if
we can hold on to it.  First come, first serve.

When is the wedding?  We're set for 11/01/01.  Be sure to take your sweety
out on the balcony tonight and gaze at the full moon.  It was sure beautiful
coming up last night.  We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket
and watch for the space shuttle.  I had a couple of hickies on my neck the
day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns.  Just
jealous.

My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate
within the four year period.  She still has some sort of scholarship but I
am not for sure how much it pays.  She is going to be a kinesiologist,
sports injury therapist.  I think she just wants to be able to touch
football players legs.  She will be 20 on 11/03.  I am really proud of her.
Cindy said Jaime has grown up very much.
You should e mail her sometimes.  I am sure she would like to hear from you.

1115,"Steve Stonestreet at CGAS did verify that metered production on CGAS is ""attached"" to the AS (aggregation service) contracts, and from there you would schedule it to a transport contract or into the IPP contract.  CGAS and Dominion work very similar when talking about metered production.

I would be happy to include you on the schedule below that I email to Jim and Pete showing this activity.  Let me know.

1123,"These are my notes on flowing gas.  Tetco will be the problem pipeline.  I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it.  I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00.  I'm using the following formula

	MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price 

They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem.  It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.  I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.  If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.

Who knows what volumes are going to be?

1129,"I forget and you are so wonderful.  Who do I talk to about capacity release?

"
1130,"To ensure everyone is on the same page for maximum dispatch.

80,000 for Hopewell Dispatch:

10,000 nom'd on Secondary FTS TCO contract. Secondary nominated to reserve 
place in the queue
20,000 Hopewell Transport (idle right now, if TCO constrains, will need 
inground storage transfer with CGV)
7,000  Leach to Richmond Transport (pending release)
30,000 to 50,000 Dayton Transport (secondary transport, depends on available 
capacity from Dayton, and if TCO lets it flow)

67,000 to 87,000 Possible TCO transport.

We should get an IT discount rate on TCO (CES had 1.5 to 3.5 discount rate 
last summer). We had to use IT several times last summer.


40,000 for Calp Dispatch:

40,000 Calp Transport 
May need Broadrun gas, if TCO contrains. John Hodge is talking to Brian Adams 
at TCO to have Leach as receipt point before July 7th.


Like Joann says below, we will need a game plan and especially one for the 
weekends. Every Friday afternoon, we will meet with Robin/Dick to clarify TCO 
transport availabilty, TCO flow constraints, and supply sources to meet this 
maximum dispatch load.

Thanks for everyone's help in getting the Cogen's 
running!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"
1138,"Answers to your quetions:
Yes; no; maybe

Just kidding....
Interconnects for Calp and Dayton handled the same...just add those meters to 
the sell tkts to CES and the buys are the delivery points.  Don't path the 
actual contract in Unify...When we hold that capacity and EDI, we'll path in 
Unify.... We don't get the bills from TCO  in January for that contract.  Get 
em in February (when we hold the capacity).  They are set up in Unify but we 
won't actually use....We are providing that service for those guys.

Try  your best for trueing up the transport tkts and the CALP and Dayton tkts 
in Sitara.  Impact is on P and L for the desk daily and later on for the 
(O/A) operational analysis where the accountants compare what we estimated 
our costs and revenues for the desk were and what they actually came in 
at.......We know January will be messy...

Go ahead and true up the PAL agreement to match physical flow......

BUY/SELLS with ENA and CES.  We talked at the beginning of the month about 
this.  Sales/buys  to/from ENA on the CES reports and sales/buys to/from CES 
on the ENA facilitation by location reports should just be pahted as 
buy/sells.  (hopefully should be done already......)

1148,"Just for your information--this may highlight the reason for the difficulty 
for the East Region dividing its transportation usage tickets by contract 
number.  For the entire month of May, the Central region's transport p&l 
report is 20 pages long (and that's after splitting up transport tickets by 
contract number); the West report is 34 pages long; and the East + Market 
East report is 90 pages long without splitting transport tickets by contract 
number.  If the East began breaking up usage tickets by contract number, it 
could result in a five to seven fold increase in tickets.  

Any thoughts ?

"
1151,"I met with Jeff Kiester of DTI yesterday regarding the storage offering they 
have on the market.  They have 3 Bcf storage capacity and 30,000dt/d of 
FT-GSS up for bid by 2/12/01. However there will be up to an additional 10 
Bcf of storage capcity available before 4/1/01 depending on additional 
turnback.  All of this capacity is utility turnback mainly, East Ohio, 
National Fuel and RG&E.
Potential uses for DTI storage:
1.  Desk use - If we buy the storage without the transportation we would 
inject and withdraw at SP.  If we do submit a bid, I would recommend that we 
try to incorporate free intramonth injection capability, effectivly giving us 
a no-notice type service that we could use to take physical positions in the 
cash market.  The current park/loan rate is $0.07 /dt/d, it seems we utilize 
this 2-3 times a month.
2.  VNG - AGL could want to look into adding storage to the VNG portfolio,  
the drawback is that the PL1 line has no excess deliverability, VNG's need is 
more a peak day issue.
3.  Partner with EES - Paul Tate from EES also sat in on our meeting, he 
expressed an interest in looking into potential partnering oppourtunities 
with the East desk regarding markets on TCO and DTI.  This storage offering 
for example could be something we partner on.  I plan to meet with Paul at 
the beggining of next week to discuss further (Dick I will check with you on 
your availability).

Jeff also indicated there will be more transportation capacity turned back in 
the near future.  There will be a posting for 75,000 dt/d of Lebanon - Leidy 
capacity coming out in the next few weeks.  

Market view on capacity release:
With the utilities turning back transportation, the economics of the capacity 
release market will change.  The utilities have historically released 
transportation in the summer months for $0.05 or less (as low as $0.01) in 
order to recover something from their asset.  DTI will now be the marketer of 
the turned back capacity.  Historically the pipeline has been very reluctant 
to sell capacity below max rate in the winter and less than 50% ($0.12 at 
current rates) in the summer.   Jeff indicated that his view is that capacity 
values will increase slighly this summer and significantly next summer due to 
the new power gen load coming online 2002.  As part of DTI's last rate case 
settlement FT-GSS holders can no longer release transportation in the summer, 
that went into effect last summer-00.  Although the capacity release market 
was a little tighter last summer it did not significantly drive up capacity 
release prices in the summer-00.  My view is that two of the three power gen 
loads will be interuptible and therfore will not sigificantly increase the 
overall load factor of the system.  The bottom line is that DTI is competing 
with capacity release and I feel there will be enough capacity release 
available on the market this summer to force DTI to sell it's capacity below 
50% of max rate.  However capacity release prices may increase next year as 
more utilities turnback capacity and the new power generation may be in the 
capacity release market.

Market View on Basis on CNG for Summer 01 & Summer 02:
With the increased load and potentially low storage inventory level going 
into this summer, basis could be strong vs historical prices. However, with 
the inception of M&NEP delivering 400,000dt/d into the Northeast last year 
CNG basis (summer strip) was less than $0.20 in Jan-00 and Feb-00,  even 
though the April 1 storage inventory level was the lowest since 1996.  In 
1996 CNG Apr-Oct strip traded as high as high as $0.31 in Feb-96 and dropped 
as low as $0.21 by May-96.  DTI summer load is averages 2.5 - 3.0 Bcf, I 
don't think the 100,000dt/d load of the new power gen load will be 
significant this summer considering the additional supply coming in from 
Dracut.   However with American National Power Inc (34,000Dth/d) and El Paso 
Gas Services Co (139,000dt/d) both coming online in 2001, that have 
contracted for around half of the Dracut supply, this may cause sumer basis 
prices to increase from current levels (Apr-01-Oct-01 strip $0.33) this 
summer and depending on storage inventories 4/1/02,  Apr-Oct-02 basis may be 
also get stronger.

1155,"Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience 
at Enron and what can be done to make it better.  That's why Enron wants to 
check your pulse.  In fact, we've changed the name of last year's ""Excellence 
Through Communication"" employee survey to The Pulse.  This new name more 
accurately captures the purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis helps us 
correct problem areas so we can continue to make Enron a great place to work.

Starting Monday, October 16, you will be asked to provide input into Enron 
and your work environment.  We would like to have 100% participation across 
Enron, because the only way to make things better is to know where we need to 
make improvements.


Will be available:  Monday, October 16 - Friday, Oct. 27
Will be located at: survey.enron.com

There are a few things you should remember about The Pulse:

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.  You can complete your survey 
at your desk via the intranet at survey.enron.com.  If you prefer, special 
computer kiosks will be available in some of our larger offices and group 
computer terminals will be available in smaller field offices.  We want to 
provide you with the most comfortable environment possible, as your 
participation is of vital importance to Enron.
2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best to 
cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action preventative 
processes that will help identify smaller problems before they become major 
ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are 
collected in the survey -- your active role will help us identify the best 
solutions.

In last year's survey, employees identified several problem areas regarding

1156,"Chris,

Still trying to get Ashland straight.  Thanks for the information yesterday.
Enron, Ashland are TCO are all of the same accord, in that all are saying that
the gas came from Enron and not CES.  The problem is that CES has paid Enron
for this same 1022 per day for those three months.  This is what we have
confirmed with TCO as well...that CES did not make these volumes available to
Ashland, either.

We are showing that Enron invoiced and that CES paid $79,125.80 for 31,662 
dths
for these volumes in January, $87,442.34 for 31,682 in February (s/b 29,638 
dth
but we were invoiced and paid for 31,662) and March was $86,491.86 for 31,682
again.  This makes for a total refund due CES of $253,059.99 for these
volumes.  This could be paid along with the storage imbalance sale to Enron 
for
$183,339.00 for a total of these two transactions of $436,398.99.

Thanks for your attention to this.  Call me if you have questions.

Jan-March.  If you need any more information, please let me know.
thanks for your help.

1159,"Chris,
As we discussed, please get with Brenda Fletcher and set this up as a demand 
to pay the .0153 storage fee, since the pathing does not allow me to pay 
through the Volume system.  As long as it is on the deal, it will show up in 
Settlements and I can pay.  Also, I need it done from January 2000 to current.

Thanks,

"
1163,"Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term

Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

1169,"John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Party""  buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did 
on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power.  Not a big deal for 
October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again 
for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party 
gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.

Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your 
transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel 
and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what 
the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on

1226,Are you getting married!!??
1227,"According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: 
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price  and the transport expense?

"
1228,"We sold directly to Clinton for the term of our deals.  Clinton (Latrove) 
should have pulled directly from Power Gas Marketing's pool.  The Power Gas 
Marketing supply deal ends Oct 31st and the local production deal ends Nov 
30th and then we will be out of the local production business.  We've tried 
to tell everyone but I bet you still get phonecalls until we are out of it.  
Sorry.

1229,"It is over with.  The addendum may or may not be signed and its a seperate document and I will personally pay for all legal cost incurred regarding the addendum.  But the other documents are in route to me, i get it, i sign it, you and donny sign it, i send it back, waaaala!!  The lawyer told that once the documents are filed with the courthouse then everything becomes ours (I don't call the lawyer anymore because her time is ""billable"")  I don't think its that simple though.

Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of NiSource, INC.  MHP currently operates 2 facilities.  The Moss Bluff facility in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La.

I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.  I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline."

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 
for the month.  

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will 
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has 
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat 
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure 
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not 
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's 
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. 

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly 
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

1261,"We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons."
1262,"Please terminate the following CNG contracts effective 6/30/2000.  For June, 
we released this capacity to Energy Express.  Boston Gas recalled this 
capacity effective 6/30/2000.  I changed the deal tickets in Sitara.

1268,"Doug, 

This is a recap of my understanding of our damages calculation in the Calpine 
matter:

For the year 2000, EPMI relied primarily on the contract with Oxychem to 
fulfill its obligations to LCRA.  EPMI paid $1 per kilowatt month for a total 
of $1.2 million for capacity under the Oxychem deal.

In addition, we had costs and expenses to supply energy to LCRA when it 
exercised its option. [Doug, I need to revisit our calculation here to make 
sure I understand it. Ed, this is information that I will need to supplement 
for you.]  We also paid liquidated damages on, as you recall, two occasions, 
when we could not physically supply power.  I received documentation from 
Mike Curry that shows LDs of $55,821.50 for 5/12/2000. We are attempting to 
locate documentation of the other day for which we had to pay LDs, but you 
believe it would have been a similar amount.  We also discussed the issue of 
additional damages caused by LCRA's ability to select an 8 hour peaking 
option rather than a full 16 hour on peak day.  EPMI would generally need to 
purchase a full 16 hour piece in order to fulfill LCRA's 8 hour peaking 
option.  EPMI could then attempt to sell the extra 8 hours, but could only do 
so on the spot market and typically at a substantial discount over what EPMI 
could have sold the full 16 hour piece.  The process of pulling documentation 
to show what we used to fulfill the days when LCRA selected the peaking 
option, and what part of the remainder of that piece we were able to resell 
(and at what price) is a very labor intensive process, which we currently 
have underway. You estimate that this ""scaler"" issue resulted in 
approximately $250,000.00 additional damages, which we will confirm as we are 
able to locate the documentation.  Your estimate of total damages related to 
the year 2000 is $1 to 1.5 million.  [I need to clarify whether this is in 
addition to the $1.2 million capacity charge.]

For the year 2001, we are primarily relying on the Frontera contract.  We 
paid Frontera $6.2 million for the year.  We do not know how much of the $6.2 
million we will be able to recoup from sales to LCRA and others, because we 
do not know with certainty what the price of natural gas will be and how many 
days LCRA will exercise either the daily 16 hour option or the 8 hour peaking 
option.  Thus, we can, at best, estimate what our total costs will be for 
2001.  Thus far into the year, LCRA has only exercised its option a handful 
of times.  Your approximation was 5 times.  This results in minimal recovery 
based on sales to LCRA.  When LCRA has chosen not to exercise its option we 
have gone into the spot market to sell the power.  Our records indicate that 
we have sold the Frontera piece, when we could, and have recovered a total of 
$515,084 from 1/1/2001 through 4/18/2001.  ( This is from a schedule provided 
by Eric Saibi.) For the remainder of April 2001, we can estimate perhaps  an 
additional $129,408.  (I arrived at this figure by taking the average profit 
per mwh for the 1st half of April and applying it to the last 8 week days of 
the month).

Assuming that LCRA will exercise its option for most of the months of May, 
June, July and August 2001, we can arrive at an estimated recovery as 
follows:  Taking an average natural gas price of $5.00, our variable costs 
for purchase of energy from Frontera will be $41.29 per mwh, and our variable 
costs for sales to LCRA will be $56.70; thus, we will recover approximately 
$15.41 per mwh sold to LCRA.

There are 89 weekdays from May 1 through August 31.  LCRA is expected to 
purchase full 16 hour days at times and choose only the peaking option at 
times (8 hours).  We can blend this amount to average 12 hour days.  $15.41 x 
100 mw x 12 hours x 89 days = $1, 645,788.  We may be able to sell the 
remaining half days when LCRA selects the peaking option on the spot market 
at a reduced price.  If we are able to sell these 8 hour blocks at an average 
profit of $5.00 per mwh, we will recover an additional $178,000.  We may 
occasionally  be able to sell weekend hours during the summer months. Again 
assuming an average of $5.00 profit per mwh, we might recover an additional 
$272,000 ($5.00 x 100 mw x 16 hours x 34 days).  

We expect that LCRA will not exercise its option as often during the months 
of September through December.  Using similar modelling, we can expect to 
recover perhaps an additional $750,000 to $1 million for the remainder of the 
year.  

Using these estimates we anticipate that we will recover approximately $3.75 
million of our expenditure of $6.2 million, for a total loss of approximately 
$2.45 million for the year 2001.  Because of the imprecision of our ability 
to estimate future variables, we should call this estimated damages of $2 to 
2.5 million.

I understand that we do not have our cover for 2002 finalized, but that we 
can expect losses similar to 2001, although perhaps a little lower.  For 
purposes of estimation at this point, we would forecast a loss of $ 1.5 to 2 
million for 2002.

Doug, Please review this damages discussion at soon as you can, and then call 
me with any clarifications.  Thanks.

Here's a list of things that I came up with that I believe we need to 
prioritize and act on.  I'd like to discuss it with you during our meeting on 
Friday.  Please think about it this week and let me know what I've forgotten 
- or any other ideas you might have.  I've also attached the beginnings (very 
rough - needs a LOT of work still) of a business plan.  Please review it and 
let me know what you think.  Here's the list:

1.  Finish business plan - what are our goals?  How do we achieve them most 
efficiently? etc.
2.  Review current coverage strategy, i.e. who are we calling, how often, 
what have results been, etc.
3.  Determine exactly who our key targets should be (most likely industrial 
in my opinion).
4.  Get our marketing materials in order:
 a.  QSE pitchbook; and

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522."

EPMI has established an ERCOT LSE account (agreement) on its own and separate from EES's.  There has been zero activity on the account.  As for the IT issues, we contracted with a company called ESG to facilitate all communication (software, etc) for the LSE account.  The ESG contract is assignable and the people at ESG are eager for that to happen.

As discussed, attached is the model for the City of Mesa deal. Here is the 
summary....

ENA is currently selling gas to the City of Mesa at a fixed price of 
$3.74/mmbtu.  It is a 1 year deal that began in August of 2000 and expires in 
July 2001.
City of Mesa wants to use the value in this contract to buy down an new index 
(physical delivery) deal that begins August 2001 and ends January 2002.
They are willing to raise the price on the existing deal to about $4.50/mmbtu 
and use the value to discount the new floating index deal about $.30/mmbtu

The summary page is the best place to start and probably has all the info you 
need for your analysis.


Again, the orginators (Dave Fuller and Jeffrey Oh, Portland) are looking to 
transact on Monday (Jan 22).

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will touch base with you 
mid-morning on Monday.

Thanks in advance,

1308,"? Over the weekend, Gov. Davis and Senate Polance made an informal agreement 
whereby Senate Polance has agreed to sponsor the SoCal MOU bill.  Polanco is 
a Democrat and is  currently suffering through a personal scandal and as a 
result, it is  reported that his political career is essential dead.   
Polance is planning to run for mayor of Los Angeles rather than run for 
another Senate term.  

? The bill is expected to be introduced in the new extraordinary session, 
beginning today or tomorrow.  The bill would first go to the Senate Energy 
Committee.  Sen. Bowen, the chair of the committee, strongly opposes the MOU, 
so the bill is expected to remain in committee hearings for some time.  The 
longer the bill is involved in committee politics and changes are made, the 
likelihood of a SoCal bankruptcy increases.

It's a cocktail party so the attire is business casual to semi formal.
The date is Saturday, December 2nd.
Entertainment will once again be provided by the band; 8th Ave. Instinct.
(I will be collecting suggestions for a new name for the band :)
Start showing up around 7pm - That's close to when the band will start.
We're thinking more along the lines of an acoustic session this time in an
effort to avoid any Grinch's a.k.a. Pigs.
No cover.  *We're just asking that everyone bring a bottle of their own
boos.*  We'll provide the mixers and some boos of our own.

Here is our address and directions for those of you who did not make it to
the last party...
4802 SW Vacuna St., Portland.   Ph: 503-246-1700
If you're coming from Portland go South on Barbur Blvd. towards Tigard.
Turn Left on to Capital Hwy.  Go up less then 3/4 of a mile (Capital Hwy.
turns into 49th St.) and see 7-11 on right hand side.  Our street is 4 or 5
streets after 7-11, on the left.
Turn Left on to Vacuna St.  (If you get to PCC Sylvania, you've gone too
far.)  Our place is the 4th house on the right side.

I'd love to see all of you there.  We're hoping for a turn-out like our last
party so again, feel welcome to bring whoever.
See you then, if not sooner!

CEOs Speak on the Strategic Importance (or Lack Thereof) of Information
Technology in the Energy Industry
By: Jon T. Brock, Director, Strategic and Competitive Intelligence

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Four CEOs participated in a panel entitled the ""CEO Mega Panel: View From
the Top"" at the 48th annual EEI/AGA Energy Information Technology Conferenc=
e
in Phoenix this week.  The moderator was Charles Bayless, former chairman,
president and CEO of Illinova.  The remaining three CEOs included: Keith
Stamm, CEO, Aquila Energy; Dr. Matthew Cordaro, president and CEO, Midwest
ISO; and James Pignatelli, chairman, president and CEO, UniSource Energy.


ANALYSIS:  This panel was diversified in a very interesting manner. The
conference organizers did a good job in getting a cross-section of the
energy industry in transition.  The trading organization specialist was
represented with Aquila, the ISO specialist was represented with the Midwes=
t
ISO, and the vertically integrated utility was represented with UniSource
Energy.  Each panelist was asked what role information technology (I/T)
played in their respective organization.  Their answers may surprise you.

Dr. Matthew Cordaro of the Midwest ISO went first.  Dr. Cordaro stressed
that I/T was very critical to the operation of an ISO, saying ""it is=20
essentially
the foundation of the ISO."" He mentioned that the Midwest ISO had started
from scratch and would have to be able to handle hundreds of thousands
of transactions every week in a real-time operation.  Among the=20
responsibilities
that the Midwest ISO is entrusted with are: monitoring the congestion on
the grid and taking appropriate action, preventing gaming through market
monitoring, settlement processing (who owes who what), and handling the
dispute process.

The Midwest ISO signed a contract with the Regional Transmission Organizati=
on
(RTO) Alliance on July 20 of this year to deliver an integrated control
center system (ICCS) that, when complete, will provide $50 million in=20
infrastructure
for the MISO.  The RTO Alliance, which consists of ALSTOM ESCA Corporation
of Seattle, Open Access Technology International (OATI) of Minneapolis,
Perot Systems of Dallas, Texas, and TenFold Corporation of Salt Lake City,
Utah, will deliver an electricity transmission system that will enable
MISO to match electricity demand with available transmission. The hardware
and software in the ICCS project will support MISO's operational functions
including transmission planning, reservation, scheduling, real-time monitor=
ing
and control, settlement and billing.  Dr. Cordaro also stated that Lodestar
was involved in the MISO and that communications had been outsourced to
AT&T Solutions.

Keith Stamm of Aquila Energy went next.  Keith began by clarifying Aquila's
focus as trading: owning very little assets in a high-volume, low-margin,
high-volatility business.  I/T is very important in the trading business.
Real-time information must be known and disseminated appropriately to
the right individuals.  Keith believes that one of Aquila's strategic asset=
s
and strengths is its risk management system.  Aquila strives for a real-tim=
e
calculation of risk.

Aquila Energy, a subsidiary of UtiliCorp United, Inc., has been a surprisin=
g
winner in the trading marketplace this year, showing a 113-percent growth
since last year with $9 billion total revenue for the past six months,
of that $55 million in trading revenue compared to $18 million in 1999.
The EBIT was $34.2 million vs. $9 million a year ago. Aquila has gathered
top traders and intellectual, financial, and risk management personnel
to enthusiastically participate in the power marketing race.

Keith mentioned a recent alliance with five other companies =01* including
top traders AEP and Duke Energy =01* as an investment step Aquila perceived
was necessary to keep pace with trader tycoon Enron and other online tradin=
g
platforms. The Energy Trading Consortium (Duke Energy, AEP, Aquila Energy,
Reliant Energy, Southern Company Energy Marketing and El Paso Energy) is
in progress to create an exchange that the participants hope will reap
benefits from the transaction cost, liquidity, volume and speed of exchange=
.
This consortium differentiates itself from EnronOnline by bringing many
buyers and sellers to the platform as opposed to one-to-many.  Another
competitor recently launched is e-Speed's TradeSpark.

James Pignatelli of UniSource Energy went last and had some controversial
statements concerning information technology.  James stated that I/T in
the vertically integrated utility is not strategic, at least not at the
present time.  James believes that I/T will become strategic someday (in
the deregulated market).

James claims getting frustrated with platform switching in the I/T arena.
He mentioned pulling in his I/T folks and saying, ""Let's switch the=20
distribution
network to DC power and once the public has bought new appliances, we'll
switch back to AC."" While James' comments may have been controversial with
the more than 500 attendees and approximately 50 energy CIOs in the audienc=
e,
he does have a point.  The vertically integrated utility's core strength
is to generate power and distribute it to ""captive"" customers reliably.
While some I/T systems (like outage management and SCADA devices) may
be strategic in this sense, the other parts of I/T are questionable and
could be candidates for outsourcing.

James claims to be working on B-2-B and B-2-C initiatives at the moment.
His vision for B-2-C is a smart chip in the residence that has access
to instantaneous pricing information.  The residence will ""buy"" electricity
for itself from the most efficient supplier and it will be able to reduce
load, thereby reducing the T&D utility to a simple conduit for service.


James and Charles Bayless both were involved in New Energy Ventures prior
to its sale to AES.  In 1997, Tucson Electric invested $3 million in NEV
and Charles Bayless (then Tucson Electric's chairman, president and chief
executive officer) and James Pignatelli (Tucson Electric's senior vice
president and chief operating officer) served on New Energy Venture's=20
administrative
committee.

It is interesting to view the different parts of the energy marketplace
as it unbundles and the profound impact that is occurring on the associated
I/T systems.  If one were to stop and think about it, deregulation could
not occur without the complex I/T systems that are employed today in the
marketplace.  I wonder what Thomas Edison and Samuel Insull would have
thought about an unbundled electric marketplace.  It is, in fact, undoing
their design of an integrated electric system constructed for operational
efficiency.

Ministers urged to back Lamfalussy report
Financial Times - March 21, 2001
By Peter Norman

The European Banking Federation, representing 3,000 mainly private-sector
banks in the European Union, yesterday urged an immediate end to the
institutional wrangling holding up agreement on the Lamfalussy report on
faster financial market legislation in the EU, Peter Norman reports from
Brussels.

Ambassadors from EU member states meet today in Brussels to try to resolve
the three-way squabble between the council of ministers, the Commission and
the European parliament over the powers each institution should cede to
enable the EU securities committee, proposed by Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy,
to enact legislation. EU finance ministers will discuss it tomorrow evening
in Stockholm before the EU summit on Friday and Saturday.

Writing to each finance minister, Maurizio Sella, the federation's chairman,
said any delay would damage development of European financial markets


Liberalisation of financial services tops summit agenda
Financial Times - March 21, 2001
By Brian Groom

Liberalisation of financial services will be Britain's priority for this
week's Stockholm summit, the government said yesterday as it rejected claims
economic reform in the European Union was going too slowly.

Tony Blair, prime minister, suffered a setback, however, when Lionel Jospin,
his French counterpart, said he would resist early deadlines for full
liberalisation of gas and electricity.

A dispute with the French would overshadow the summit of EU leaders on
Friday and Saturday, which comes as Mr. Blair prepares to call the general
election, expected on May 3. Britain wants full liberalisation of energy
markets by 2003.

Alastair Campbell, Mr. Blair's spokesman, rejected claims by the European
Round Table of Industrialists that there had been little action since last
year's Lisbon summit on issues such as liberalisation of energy, postal
services, financial markets, air traffic control and creation of a
union-wide patent.

""Those who say the impetus is not for economic reform and that there hasn't
been progress have got it wrong,"" he said. ""We think Europe has got the
message on economic and social liberalisation. Stockholm is about
accelerating the change.""

He said 2.5m jobs had been created in the EU last year. Denmark and the
Netherlands had joined Sweden in overtaking the US for the percentage of
homes with internet access: the EU average had doubled to 28 per cent
compared with 47 per cent in the US, with Britain on 41 per cent.

EU investment in information and communications technology had outstripped
the US as a proportion of gross domestic product for the first time last
year.

Mr. Campbell said faster liberalisation of financial services would help
investors, the finance industry and consumers.

Britain wants the Lamfalussy group's report on financial reform implemented
by the year-end, but it is caught up in a dispute over jurisdiction between
member states, the European Commission and European Parliament.

Mr. Blair and Wim Kok, the Dutch prime minister, published a joint paper
calling for action to close the gap with the US on biotechnology. Other
British objectives include a business-led taskforce to address skills gaps
and moves to improve mutual recognition of professional qualifications,
lighten regulation on small business, cut air traffic control delays and cut
car prices.

* The government was accused yesterday of trying to ""rig"" a Brussels
competition inquiry by organising a write-in campaign by MPs.

Opposition Conservative MPs were angry after discovering the Department of
Trade and Industry had supplied a ""core script"" that MPs and others could
use to lobby the European Commission to approve a Pounds 60m (Dollars 86m)
regional venture capital proposed by Gordon Brown, chancellor.

The Commission is likely to approve the scheme, but Mr. Brown has accused
officials of dragging their feet.


Crisis-hit Argentina continued to dominate credit derivatives trading on
Tuesday....
Reuters - March 20, 2001

LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Crisis-hit Argentina continued to dominate
credit derivatives trading on Tuesday, almost knocking the Federal Reserve's
decision on U.S interest rates due later in the day off its perch as chief
talking point.

The price of five year default swaps for Argentina widened out to
1,000/1,200 from 950/1,050 at the start of the week, traders said. The move
was even more dramatic at the shorter-end of the curve, with one-year credit
protection on Argentine debt being quoted at 1,200/1,300 from 950.

Credit default swaps, the most active part of the credit derivatives market,
are insurance-like tools that enable investors to juggle exposure to the
risk of an issuer defaulting on a debt or loan.

The resignation of economy minister Ricardo Lopez Murphy after just two
weeks in office has heightened a political crisis in Argentina that
threatens to spill over into other emerging markets. This follows Lopez
Murphy's efforts to lift the economy out of recession with a searing
austerity programme aimed at raising investor confidence.

Domingo Cavallo, the architect of Argentina's embattled ten year-old fixed
exchange rate regime, was named his successor.

With Cavallo yet to set out his policy programme to cut $3 billion off the
Argentine fiscal deficit and tackle the country's crisis, it remained to be
seen how the U.S. market would open.

""For Argentina, the liquidity has just dried up on the default swaps. What
offers are out there are distressed,"" a New York based trader at a U.S. bank
said.

Events in Argentina hit the rest of the emerging markets asset class. ""Latin
America generally is better bid and offers are few and far between,"" a
broker said.

Among the other sovereigns affected was South Africa. ""The five year default
swap is at 185/235 and the three year is at 125/175, and that's more than
10% worse than last week,"" he added.

BACK IN EUROPE

Trading conditions elsewhere were described as relatively thin, but if
traders were keeping their powder dry ahead of the U.S. FOMC meeting, they
weren't saying.

In Europe, the story remained one of default swap prices on corporate debt
edging inwards and edging outwards on telecoms debt.

""The general trend for European corporates for the past week has been one of
prices trading lower, with bids being hit and offers being lifted,"" a broker
said. ""We're talking small, mind,"" he added, ""maybe 2-3 basis points tighter
below a price of 50 and around 5 bps at 50-plus.""

Five year default swaps on BASF traded at 21/28 on Tuesday from 23/29 on
Monday. The German chemical group posted better than expected fourth quarter
earnings last week and is forecasting double-digit growth this year and
next.

Not so the embattled telecoms sector. On Tuesday morning five-year default
swaps on the debt of British Telecom widened five basis points from Monday
to a bid/offer spread of 162/169, before settling back to 160/165.

In comparison, the spread between BT's February 2006 euro-denominated bond
has a mid-rate yield spread of 125bps over 3-month Libor, while the December
2005 dollar bond was 145bps over Libor.

Five-year default swaps on the debt of France Telecom were cited by the
dealer at 158/165, unchanged since Monday, and 155/165 on Deutsche Telekom,
also unchanged.


CREDIT DERIVATIVES MAY SUBJECT INVESTORS TO UNEXPECTED RISKS
Moody's - March 20, 2001

New York, March 20, 2001 -- In a new special report outlining potential
risks in credit default swaps, Moody's Investors Service says that if credit
events are defined too broadly, a credit default swap may pass along the
risk of loss following mere credit deterioration instead of the risk of loss
following an actual default.

""Investors often assume the risk of a synthetic investment, by way of a
credit derivative, is equivalent to the risk of a cash investment in the
same credit. However, if not structured carefully, the synthetic investment
can be riskier than the cash investment,"" says Jeffrey Tolk, a Moody's
analyst and author of the report, ""Understanding the Risks of Credit Default
Swaps.""

Among Moody's key sources of concern are the prevailing standard definitions
for ""credit events."" Under a credit default swap, losses to investors are
determined synthetically, based on credit events occurring in a reference
credit. Thus, investors' risk is driven largely by the definition of credit
events in the swap.

The broader the definition, the broader the risk, according to Moody's.


SOME STANDARD DEFINITIONS ARE BROAD

Moody's report includes a detailed look at the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association's (ISDA) widely referenced ""credit event""
definitions.

""In some critical areas, ISDA's current definitions are broader than the
market's understanding of ""default,"" and could, in some cases, increase the
risk of loss by triggering payouts for events that are not actually
defaults,"" says Tolk.

""An obligation that has been restructured to defer principal payments may
not technically be a default if the lender has been properly compensated.
But ISDA would nonetheless define this as a credit event,"" he says.

Conversely, under ISDA's definition of ""obligation acceleration,"" a credit
default swap investor might suffer a loss although an investor in the
underlying cash position would suffer no loss.

OTHER SOURCES OF RISK: VALUATION DISCREPANCY, MORAL HAZARD


In addition to ""credit events,"" Tolk cites the risks that arise from the
difficulty of valuing defaulted credits to determine the extent of loss to
investors under a cash-settled credit default swap.

""Calculated losses may vary based on liquidity, market conditions, and the
identity of the parties supplying bids. In analyzing a credit default swap,
Moody's looks carefully at the methods and procedures for calculating loss
given default,"" he says.

The report also says that investors should be aware of moral hazard - the
inherent conflict of interest that exists because the sponsoring financial
institution determines the timing of a loss event as well as how much loss
is imposed on investors.

""The sponsor's incentive is to construe 'credit events' as expansively as
possible and to calculate losses as generously as possible,"" says Tolk.
""Moody's considers these factors carefully when rating securities supported
by credit default swaps.""

Tolk believes that these risks can be addressed by tightening the credit
event and loss calculation provisions, increasing transparency, and
providing more objective mechanisms for verifying loss determinations.

The capital markets have an enormous capacity for absorbing credit risk, and
this capacity has only been partially tapped by the credit derivatives
market. In Moody's opinion, for capital markets investors to participate
fully in the growing credit derivatives market, the risks inherent in credit
default swaps should be more precisely defined, more transparently managed,
and more readily quantifiable.


How traders in capacity can make rapid new connections
Financial Times - March 21, 2001
By Alan Stewart

Online trading exchanges have been set up in many sectors of commerce, and
telecommunications is no exception. But while some exchanges focus on
physical goods, such as car components or hospital supplies, the telecoms
version is dealing with something more intangible - bandwidth.

A number of online exchanges have been set up to trade in bandwidth,
matching buyers and sellers via bid and offer prices, and taking a
percentage of the price paid. According to research by Arthur Andersen, the
telecoms market will be transformed by bandwidth trading.

The bandwidth being traded may take the form of physical circuits linking
two cities, or the data packets and voice calls sent over them. A recent
Europe-wide survey by Andersen revealed a market in flux, but one which
believed in the inevitability of bandwidth commoditisation.

""Online bandwidth trading exchanges have arrived in response to a need,
because of a bandwidth glut,"" says Simon Forge, principal telecommunications
analyst at UK consultancy OSI. ""For some of the latest networks going in,
people are claiming petabits per second - that's a billion megabits per
second.""

Exchanges have been set up by Arbinet (based in New York), Band-X (London),
and RateXchange (San Francisco) - see accompanying stories. Other exchanges
already running or being set up include GlobalTeleExchange (GTE in
Washington), Asia Capacity Exchange (ACE in Hong Kong), International
Telecommunications Clearing Corporation (ITCC in Dubai), and eSwitch
(Sydney).

Buyers and sellers of bandwidth are linked up through interconnecting
facilities at the switching hubs of the exchanges. RateXchange has nine of
these in the US, plus three in Europe, while ITCC intends to have hubs in
London, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, New York, and Miami.

The exchanges stress that these connections mean that bandwidth trades will
be able to be carried out in seconds. At present, it can take up to three
months to arrange a trade, with most of those arranged not actually taking
place at all. According to investment bank CIBC World Markets, Dollars 16bn
in revenues (20 per cent of the wholesale bandwidth market) may be traded by
2004.

Andersen says the bandwidth market has suffered from a lack of liquidity and
price transparency, combined with a paucity of offers and bids on the
exchanges. The company believes, however, that the presence of big energy
companies, such as Enron and Williams, in bandwidth trading is stimulating
the appetite of customers for greater product innovation and pricing.

Bandwidth is expected to follow a shorter timeline to liquidity than any
other current traded commodity. Although the detail of the emerging market
has still to be defined, Andersen expects 'city-pairs', that is, two named
cities connected by fiber optic cable, to form the basic product.

Jon Merriman, president and chief executive of RateXchange, foresees four
market segments becoming involved in bandwidth trading within the next year.


""The first are the energy merchants, the second the telecommunications
companies as a business line, the third the financial houses, and the fourth
the pure commodity players,"" he says.

""A fifth market segment - and this is longer term - will be large
corporates, who'll want to trade and optimise their use of bandwidth,"" says
Mr. Merriman. ""It'll become a treasury function at some point for large
companies. That's at least a year down the road, but there is interest right
now from some large corporates.""

Andersen points out that energy businesses, such as Enron, Williams, Aquila,
El Paso, TXU, and Dynegy have made significant investments in backbone,
customer and skills development in the last few years. Those companies'
presence has had a considerable influence on the growing bandwidth market.

Steve Elliott, chief executive of Enron Broadband Services (EBS) Europe,
says the communications market needs to become much more open and robust,
and that this will change the supply and demand dynamics. ""It's already
moving that way,"" says Mr. Elliott, who stresses that EBS does not see
itself in competition with bandwidth exchanges.

""Exchanges exist in all the markets we participate in, and they're an
overlay to the actual market itself,"" he says. ""We're not an exchange, nor
are we an 'independent player' at the exchange level, nor a bulletin board
type of facilitator. We're a market maker, a principal in all transactions
that we do, with contractual terms and physical delivery obligations.""

EBS is creating pooling points to provide physical interconnectivity between
bandwidth trading principals. Although EBS's plans for doing business in
Europe are still at a fairly early stage, the company has set up a pooling
point in London, to provide bandwidth trading between the US and Europe.
Further European pooling points are in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dusseldorf,
Frankfurt, and Paris.

Enron Online

Bandwidth-related commodities have recently been added to the Enron Online
web-enabled e-commerce platform, where the company posts its prices and
carries out commodity trading.

""Enron Online is the largest e-commerce web platform in the world for buying
and selling commodities,"" says Mr. Elliott. ""We've transacted a notional
value of over Dollars 380bn since its inception around a year ago.""

""The energy companies are all copying Enron, which is a very progressive,
rather fabulous company,"" says Marcus de Ferranti, co- founder of the
Band-X. He points out that Enron is leveraging its own network into its
trading, and thereby becoming a kind of telecommunications company in its
own right.

Mr. de Ferranti suggests the other energy companies are desperately trying
to get into the broadband revolution, having seen Enron's share price double
on the announcement of broadband.

""They're coming along in a frenzy, trying to copy it and leverage their own
infrastructures by sticking fiber along the top of their gas pipes, and
sticking cables along their electricity highways,"" he says.

But how do the telecommunications companies view bandwidth trading
exchanges? Do they see them as speeding up the commoditisation of bandwidth,
leading to a deterioration of prices?

""At the most senior level, the telecoms companies are attracted by what
we're providing,"" says Anthony Craig, chairman and chief executive of
Arbinet.

""As you come down, some see it as a threat, or even say that we're a
catalysing force for commoditisation. I find that on the verge of ludicrous,
because bandwidth is commoditising anyway,"" says Mr. Craig. ""Anything that
commoditises needs a more efficient process to manage the product. We're
responding to commoditisation.""

As for the future, the online bandwidth exchanges may face some of the
pressures which have caused problems for other B2B (business-to-business)
marketplaces.

US analyst International Data Corporation (IDC) foresees a challenge for
bandwidth trading companies in collecting fees, and believes exchanges may
suffer payment defaults.

IDC warns also that profit margins could dwindle as bandwidth costs fall,
taking margins with them.

""I suspect that bandwidth exchanges will have a relatively limited window of
opportunity, during which time they will make good money,"" says Ian Beeby,
UK managing director of US consultancy Wireless Facilities.

Mr. Forge at OSI agrees that some of the exchanges will go out of business.
However, he argues: ""Long-term, this is something that's here to stay.""


Watchful eye on energy traders
Financial Times - March 21, 2001
By Anthony Cox

After the sharp falls in their shares since last summer, telcos worldwide
might despair at the threat from US energy traders, such as Enron, to
revolutionise how capacity on carriers networks is bought and sold - further
depressing the prices operators can charge for bandwidth, their staple
product.

In two to three years, real-time trades on bandwidth, for immediate
delivery, will be possible. These will replace, at least to some extent, the
drawn out negotiations between operators when selling space on their
networks to one another.

But if new trading models will exert downward pressure on bandwidth prices
by increasing transparency and ironing out market inefficiencies, an
environment where bandwidth is traded through purpose-built exchanges has
its benefits to operators.

""In the short term, it will provide a more liquid channel for selling spare
capacity,"" says Stuart McIntosh, vice president of the Boston-based
consultancy Adventis. Longer term, it may have an impact on how operators
manage the roll out of their networks, he says.

Leasing capacity in the short term will become increasingly attractive, and
operators will opt more and more to buy or rent capacity from their rivals,
instead of building their own infrastructure.

Bandwidth trading may also increase volumes for operators by creating new
sales avenues: ""Exchanges open up new segments in the market, many of which
you wouldn't do business with if it was down to personal relationships,""
says Cecilia Herslow, carrier manager at Telia UK.

Further, operators could benefit from lower sales costs, as the expense of
setting up long-term capacity deals between operators is replaced with lower
per trade costs at the exchanges, says Martin Smillie, vice president for
marketing wholesale at KPNQwest.

He notes, however, that the operator will incur costs to set up and maintain
trading capability, whether on its own behalf or via third- party trading
houses.

Some 94 per cent of carriers expecting a liquid, traded bandwidth market to
emerge within three years, according to research by Arthur Andersen. A
market for derivatives, which could eventually dwarf the primary market,
will follow close on the heels of a market for physical bandwidth.

Two types of bandwidth exchanges are emerging: those that trade bandwidth
capacity on specific routes - say London to New York, so-called routed
capacity; and those that trade data and voice minutes, usually via internet
exchanges, such as Arbinet and Band-X.

According to Ciara Ryan, a senior manager in Arthur Andersen's bandwidth
trading team, the routed capacity market will be the most significant in
terms of revenues for operators, due to increased pressure to find new
channels to market the capacity they own on these routes.

""Owners of capacity are eager to sell their bandwidth as quickly as
possible, without destroying margins completely,"" he says, noting that
bandwidth prices are falling by up to 70 per cent annually on transatlantic
and European routes.

Several routes, or city pairs, will provide a yardstick for the prices for
capacity between other cities. Capacity on these other routes will trade at
a discount or a premium to those that have become the benchmarks, says Mr.
Ryan.

Some loss of margins may be an acceptable trade-off for more efficient
markets and possible higher volumes of traffic for operators, particularly
since bandwidth prices are expected to come down in any case, due to
capacity oversupply. Turn to next page

From facing page

But bandwidth exchanges' impact on pricing could be more significant: ""The
whole pricing structure is potentially at risk,"" says Nigel Pitcher,
director of marketing at UK-based carrier Fibernet.

If spare capacity is sold on an anonymous basis to an exchange, the
operator's existing 'list price' customers could pick up the same capacity
at an exchange at a knock-down price, while unknowingly remaining with the
provider they had originally, he says.

This could cause bandwidth prices to fall dramatically.

Downward pressure on the price of capacity would be increased if large users
were to curtail existing relationships with their operators altogether,
buying direct from the bandwidth exchanges.

This threat is dismissed by telecoms industry players, however: ""There is no
reason why large telecom users could not lease bandwidth today under most
regulatory regimes,"" says Ian Beeby, managing director of WFI, a wireless
telecommunications consultancy.

Mr. Beeby notes that most large corporations have spent the last years
trying to outsource their telecom networks and that they are unlikely to
change direction now.

The extent to which operators either embrace the new status quo or reject it
may define their success in an environment where long-term bandwidth
contracts are being replaced by more immediate trading models: ""Carriers
will either take on a very pro-active approach or a more defensive
strategy,"" says Ms Herslow at Telia.

If a player does not move fast enough a ""penalty of ignorance"" may result in
some operators losing the first mover advantage, suggest analysts. This, in
turn, may result in a loss of competitiveness relative to other players,
fuelling consolidation among global carriers, says Christian Jepsen, the
founder of Pangea, a pan-European carrier with a focus on Scandinavia.

""Ultimately, there may be three to four global carriers and only a handful
of regional ones left,"" he says.

In anticipation of significant changes in the market, Pangea is already
establishing a separate sales team to focus exclusively on capacity sales
via bandwidth exchanges.

In an increasingly complex market, telecommunications operators have no
choice but to explore new ways to exchange telecom capacity. The sheer
number of telecoms players now means that bilateral agreements between
carriers will become increasingly obsolete.

Internationally there are some 2,000 carriers. If they all were all to lease
some capacity from one another, nearly 2.5m interconnects, contracts and
settlements would be required across the industry. Avoiding a proliferation
of contracts alone is likely to change the way operators deal with one
another on bandwidth deals.

Although it is too early to see the full implications of bandwidth trading
on today's telecoms market, operators are keeping the developments under
very close review.

""Bandwidth trading may prove to be a interesting idea which simply did not
make it - but it would be rash to conclude that today,"" says Mr. McIntosh at
Adventis. He also warns that the US energy players could leverage their
experience of establishing trading in the energy market to carve a
significant niche in the telecoms sector.

This is borne out by recent developments: energy operators Williams and
Enron are understood to have joined forces recently with AT&T, Sprint,
Global Crossing and Dow Jones to provide the first index for routed
bandwidth capacity. ""If I were in a telecoms company, I would be watching
the energy traders very closely,"" says Mr. McIntosh.

need to go through the process outlined below.

[News item from Reuters, March 20] The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=

Analysis: Since the start of deregulation in the early 1990s, FERC's variou=
s=20
positions on how competition should unfold across the country have been=20
fairly consistent. Despite its changing members, as a whole the five-member=
=20
commission (with two positions currently open) has taken a ""hands-off""=20
approach to its regulatory role, preferring instead to allow free market=20
forces to drive competition in the energy industry. In fact, Curt H,bert,=
=20
appointed as FERC chairman in January by President Bush, told me in an=20
interview during his tenure as a commissioner that he envisioned a time whe=
n=20
FERC would step out of its regulatory role altogether. However, significant=

structural and philosophical changes within the FERC have surfaced since=20
January, dovetailing with the departure of former chairman James Hoecker. A=

e=20
debate over whether or not to take this controversial step seems to have=20
exposed some inherent dissension within FERC at the very time when the futu=
re=20
leadership of the commission has been cast in doubt. =20

At the House of Representatives meeting on March 20, H,bert, a Republican,=
=20
reiterated his objections to price caps. Chairman H,bert has maintained his=
=20
long-standing opinion that wholesale price caps have done and can do=20
""long-term damage."" In January, H,bert told me, ""I have seen no evidence th=
at=20
price caps will have any positive impact in creating a balanced market.""=20
Although still generally opposed to wholesale price caps on a federal or=20
regional level, H,bert is willing to consider them as one possibility among=
=20
other short-term resolutions to the ongoing market problems in California.=
=20
Reuters reported that H,bert said at the hearings that ""such controls are n=
ot=20
a long-term solution and would discourage the industry from building more=
=20
power plants to supply the West."" Rather, H,bert believes that power=20
generators need the financial incentive to build new power plants, both in=

California and elsewhere. H,bert was quoted at the subcommittee hearings as=
=20
saying, ""Market prices will increase supply and reduce demand, thus=20
correcting the current imbalance. Capping prices through regulation or=20
legislation will have exactly the opposite effect.""=20

Despite H,bert's opposition to wholesale price caps, fellow Commissioner=20
William Massey, a Democrat, asserted that California and the western region=
=20
were in such a state of disrepair that a temporary ""time out"" or price cap=
=20
was needed to let the market stabilize. ""The commission must act forcefully=
=20
and decisively to reassure market participants, policymakers and consumers=
=20
that jurisdictional wholesale markets will produce consumer benefits and ju=
st=20
and reasonable rates,"" Massey said. In addition, Massey reportedly also sai=
d=20
that ""such a price cap could be calculated on a generator-by-generator basi=
s=20
at each generator's variable operating cost, plus a reasonable capacity=20
adder, perhaps in the range of $25 per megawatt hour."" Massey reiterated th=

severity of the crisis in California, noting that whereas wholesale power i=
n=20
the state cost $7 billion in 1999 it increased to $27 billion in 2000 and=
=20
could exceed $70 billion for 2001. =20

Rounding out the commission's divided opinion was Commissioner Linda Key=20
Breathitt, a Democrat, who said that all possible options should be analyze=
d=20
and debated. Breathitt did not specifically mention any preference for pric=
e=20
controls.=20

Chairman H,bert's stand against price caps is shared by Energy Secretary=20
Spencer Abraham and seemingly the entire Bush administration. In fact,=20
Abraham said that price caps on wholesale energy will ""discourage investmen=
t=20
in new generation at a time when it is most needed"" and drive power produce=
rs=20
to other regions of the country (and further away from California). The=20
Energy Secretary reportedly issued an even stronger statement against price=
=20
caps during a Senate hearing on the electricity crisis in California. ""The=
=20
only action the administration will not take is the implementation of price=
=20
caps,"" Abraham said. =20

Another House of Representatives Energy and Air Quality subcommittee hearin=
g=20
is scheduled for later this week. Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, a Texas=
=20
Republican, noted that the subcommittee will work toward deciding whether o=
r=20
not legislation regarding wholesale price caps should be developed over the=
=20
next few weeks. =20

This is not the first time that clear schisms have become visible within FE=
RC=20
over major issues facing the energy industry. The commission also became=20
divided regarding the scope of regulation regarding regional transmission=
=20
organizations (RTOs). FERC's December 1999 vote on the Alliance RTO=20
illustrated dissension within the commission and the divergent philosophies=
=20
that the FERC commissioners hold regarding how the industry should be=20
regulated. Then-Commissioner H,bert was of the opinion that the Alliance RT=
O=20
met FERC guidelines for RTO formation, and was the sole member who=20
successfully pushed for voluntary rather than mandatory participation in an=
=20
RTO. However, H,bert stood as a minority. The other three commissioners at=
=20
FERC at the time (Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt) preferred to wield a tight=

transmission policy. While H,bert supports the ownership of RTOs by utiliti=
es=20
and letting free market principles rule, the other commissioners at FERC=20
appeared to support only passive ownership of RTOs by utilities.=20

Meanwhile, speculation continues that President Bush will soon appoint Pat=
=20
Wood III, chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), to the=
=20
position of FERC chairman. H,bert was named chairman in February by Preside=

There are two ""Republican"" openings to be filled at FERC by President Bush.=

As noted, presently H,bert is the only Republican among the current three=

Moreover, as political drivers continue to impact the structure of FERC, th=

believe that the government (including FERC and the Bush administration)=20

prices. Speaking from a non-partisan point of view, some economists now=20
question whether=01*and not just how=01*deregulation of electricity markets=
 should=20
occur at all. For instance, Alfred E. Kahn, the Cornell University economis=

Caminus and Altra Energy Partner to Create
Full-Service Trading Software Provider=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] Software company Caminus Corp. (Nasdaq: CAMZ) anno=
unced it would buy the software operations of privately held Altra Energy C=
orp. Caminus said it would swap 1.975 shares of its stock and pay $30 milli=
on cash for Altra's software business. That values the deal at about $62 mi=
llion, based on Caminus' closing price of $16.05 on Oct. 12.=20

Analysis: The announcement that Caminus and Altra Energy are joining forces=
 represents major news for the energy industry, particularly impacting thos=
e companies that are involved in the trading sector. On their own, both com=
panies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche=
. Now that Caminus is acquiring Altra's software suite, which is primarily =
focused on the natural-gas trading sector, the synergy between the two comp=
anies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved=
 in energy trading. Essentially, Altra has two core businesses-an energy tr=
ading exchange and a software business. Caminus has entered into an agreeme=
nt process to purchase only the software side of Altra. Altra has a highly =
regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily fo=
cused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operatio=
ns. Together, the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greate=
r participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges.=20

Let's first establish the business models of these two companies so that we=
 can fully appreciate the synergies that the new partnership will create. U=
p to the point of this partnership, Caminus and Altra were not considered d=
irect-line competitors, as Caminus' business model focused on risk manageme=
nt while Altra focused on the actual energy transactions. However, there we=
re components of the companies' businesses that certainly overlapped. Camin=
us Corp. has created a software suite that helps utilities and gas producer=
s trade energy commodities in exchanges such as EnronOnline, TradeSpark, Ho=
ustonStreet, etc. Altra's software, which is used in the same energy tradin=
g portals, focuses on natural-gas transactions.=20

Headquartered in New York, Caminus, which went public a year ago, is a prov=
ider of software solutions (and consulting services) that help a wide range=
 of participants in the energy market to manage their risk factors associat=
ed with energy trading. Toward that end, the company offers two software pa=
ckages:


Zai*Net software solutions, which ""enables energy organizations to effectiv=
ely trade and manage energy transactions."" Zai*Net has been designed to add=
ress a wide range of energy commodities, traded instruments and associated =
risks and was designed to interface with both proprietary and third-party s=
ystems.


Nucleus software systems, which were designed specifically to meet the trad=
ing, risk management, scheduling, and accounting needs of utilities, genera=
ting companies, power pools, gas and oil producers, processors, pipelines, =
and other energy market participants. In other words, the Caminus Nucleus s=
ystem provides a tool for energy traders to organize, track and manage thei=
r various energy transactions from generation to end-user delivery. One of =
the advantages to the Nucleus software is that users can evaluate assets an=
d market positions in real-time and consequently determine acceptable risk =
levels.=20

Recently, Caminus added the Storefront product, which is a Web-based tradin=
g application that helps customers to increase trading volume and reduce tr=
ansaction costs by publishing bids and offers on the Internet. Also, just t=
his week at the Power Mart conference in Houston, Caminus unveiled a new so=
ftware product known as FrontOffice?, which gives traders of energy physica=
ls and traded instruments the ability to see how a potential deal will affe=
ct a portfolio before committing to the transaction. According to company r=
eports, approximately 80 percent of Caminus' revenue comes from software li=
cense sales. In addition, Caminus also has a consulting service that focuse=
s on risk management services for energy clients.=20

One reason that Caminus has gotten a good share of industry attention latel=
y is its efforts, along with other software companies, to establish a commo=
n standard for moving transaction data from energy trading platforms to tra=
nsaction / risk management systems. A few months ago, Caminus established t=
he Energy Trading Standards Group with HoustonStreet, and has since generat=
ed interest in some 30 companies to participate and help create universal s=
tandards for energy trading. One of the key objectives of the Standards Gro=
up is to help determine which technology should be used as the standard pro=
tocol for energy trading platforms. The technology committee is reportedly =
working on a beta version of XML standard for physical power transactions.=
=20

In September, Caminus formed a strategic partnership with Lodestar Corp., w=
hich primarily provides billing software and load forecasting solutions. Un=
der the partnership, Caminus and Lodestar will work to integrate and jointl=
y market their respective wholesale and retail energy billing, transaction,=
 trading, and risk management systems to create what they are calling a ""St=
raight-Through Processing (STP)"" environment for vertically integrated ener=
gy companies.=20

By comparison, Altra Energy is a private company located in Houston that pr=
ovides software systems primarily focused on managing the transactions and =
physical movement of the gas and pipeline segment of the industry. Altra re=
portedly has the largest base of systems in the gas segment of the market. =
Some of the specific features of the Altra software include scheduling of d=
irect access load, generation dispatch, regional transmission organization =
(RTO) connectivity, integrated OASIS reservations, and North American Elect=
ric Reliability Council (NERC) checkout and billing. Altra boasts a custome=
r list of about 100 clients, mostly in the gas sector but also including po=
wer and multi-fuel companies. Altra's software product suite includes trans=
action management tools known as Altra Gas, Altra Power, Altra Pipeline and=
 Altra Web, which all facilitate the exchange of a particular commodity.=20

According to Caminus, the value of acquiring Altra's software suite is to c=
reate an offering of integrated applications that can be applied to both ga=
s and power traders. Further, the exchange of customers should benefit both=
 companies. Caminus will have the opportunity to sell its risk management s=
ervices to Altra's customer base, and in turn gain the opportunity to sell =
Altra's new generation of systems to Caminus customers.=20

The European market is arguably the top focus of Caminus Corp. In fact, Cam=
inus believes that the global market for energy trading is presently ""explo=
ding."" According to Caminus CEO David Stoner, the global market for wholesa=
le energy trading, which consists of the European market, is six to eight t=
imes the size of retail markets. Consequently, a typical therm gets traded =
a number of times in Europe before it actually gets sold to an end user. In=
terestingly, about 30 to 40 percent of the companies to which Caminus has p=
rovided risk management consulting services are U.S. companies attempting t=
o expand in the European wholesale trading market. Caminus consultants help=
ed write the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) for the British go=
vernment, due to be implemented by the end of 2001 or early 2002. Although =
smaller than the U.S. market, Britain has been experiencing privatization a=
nd various levels of deregulation since 1983, providing valuable experience=
 and depth. Besides the U.K., Caminus has been active throughout Europe in =
Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Germany, and the Nordic countries through N=
ORDPOOL.=20

Earnings for Caminus have been fairly strong up until recently, when fallou=
t from the events of Sept. 11 began to impact the company's business. For 2=
Q 2001, Caminus reported that its total revenues increased 58 percent to $1=
7.7 million, compared to $11.2 million for 2Q 2000. Specifically, revenues =
from the company's software license fees increased 61 percent to $7.5 milli=
on during the same quarter. However, for 3Q 2001, Caminus lost $369,000, or=
 2 cents a share, on revenue of $14.7 million, due primarily to the fact so=
me license sales that were expected to close did not. Specifically, Caminus=
 says that much of the revenue from its license sales is booked during the =
last month of each quarter. Given the impact that the events of Sept. 11 ha=
d on many companies, a large part of this anticipated revenue was not booke=
d as scheduled.=20

Moving forward, Caminus says that the addition of Altra's software should r=
esult in an increase of its 2002 revenue guidance by about 40 percent. Cami=
nus also expects the partnership with Altra to increase its 4Q earnings to =
27 cents a share, compared with a previous estimate of 23 cents a share, al=
though analysts are still projecting 19 cents a share for the fourth quarte=
r.=20

Deregulation has opened up many new opportunities for generation companies =
to trade and market power in new regions. However, with these opportunities=
 come considerable risks. Hence, creating this balance between risk and opp=
ortunity in the energy trading space is the market niche in which Caminus a=
nd Altra operate. However, the software market in the energy trading space =
is becoming increasingly competitive. Every month, new competitors in this =
space emerge, so it is difficult to offer a comprehensive list. However, so=
me competitors that also seek market share in the niche now occupied by Cam=
inus / Altra are Allegro Development, KWI and SolArc (to name just a few).=
=20

Moreover, competition in wholesale trading should continue to gain momentum=
, regardless of the status of deregulation in a particular state. The whole=
sale market is without question far more attractive to traders than the ret=
ail market, and as I mentioned power is often traded many times on the whol=
esale market before it reaches the end user. Thus, consolidation within the=
 energy-trading software space should continue, and I would expect Caminus =
to proceed with further acquisitions once it integrates the Altra software =
into its service offerings.=20

directly to Houston legal. I'll take care of that.  But after my recent visit 
to Houston, and discussions there with you and others, I just want

attention!

Regarding the March 21st meeting -- I appreciate all of your responses
regarding the rescheduling request.  While some of you were amenable (in
fact it worked better for many of you), it was not doable for a
significant number of members, in particular some who had already made
their travel plans.  As such, we'll go ahead with the meeting as
original scheduled on the 21st.  My apologies to those of you who will

1373," FYI, the highlight of this morning's Senate Energy Committee hearing
is the tentative alliance between Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith in favor
of regionwide price caps.  You'll receive a fax of his press release this
afternoon.

 The essence of the agreement (which has not been reduced to
legislative language) is that Smith is agreeing to support regionwide price
caps while Feinstein is agreeing to force California to raise retail rates.
In other words, the price cap would only apply to a state that allows its
retail rates to rise to allow utilities to pay their bills.  But Feinstein
got Smith to agree that there should be flexibility for states to determine
how and when wholesale rates will be passed on to ratepayers.  I seriously
doubt that this whole proposal will become law, but if it does, I would
expect the CPUC to thoroughly abuse this flexibility.

 In her plea for the proposal, Feinstein said that: ""I agree that the
CPUC was wrong to not allow long-term contracts.""

 Secretary Abraham and Chairman Hebert were strongly opposed to price
caps.  When asked about the Feinstein/Smith proposal, Abraham noted that he
hadn't seen anything in writing, but that, to the extent the proposal
includes prices caps, the Administration would not support it.  This was
obviously an awkward situation for Abraham because he was essentially
dumping on the proposal of a fellow Republican; nevertheless, he did it.
Abraham said that his most important mission is to keep the lights on, and
that price caps don't increase supply or decrease demand, so he's against
them.

 One of Abraham's arguments against price caps was that it would
discourage Canadian and Mexican sellers from selling into the U.S.  Bingaman
expressed strong skepticism that Mexico has much to offer, but Abraham said
that he has had talks with his Mexican counterpart on this subject, and that
every little bit helps.

 Senator Cantwell briefing endorsed the Feinstein/Smith effort, but
it did not appear that she has yet studied it.  Senator Craig said that he
is ""fundamentally skeptical"" about price caps.  He said that they have no
history of success, and that they are a distraction from working on the real
solutions.

 Locke testified in favor of ""short-term, interim [seems redundant to
me], wholesale price caps.""  He wants to base the cap on the cost of
service, and then add a reasonable rate of return.  He said that if you set
the cap high enough, it will not discourage new generation.  He also noted
that NW suppliers are out tens of millions of dollars on sales to California
for which they have not been paid.  Counterbalancing Locke, Governor Marks
(sp?) of Montana testified against price caps on the ground that it
discourages new generation.  It's worth noting that, of the 11 western
governors, only the 3 coastal governors support price caps.  The other 8
sent a letter to Bush opposing price caps.

 Hebert took the opportunity to speak out of a single RTO for the
West.  He made similar remarks yesterday at the Commission open meeting when
they were discussing the order to increase generation output in the West.

 Please call me if you have any questions.

1382,"Attached you will find the draft of the Response of the Group to the Motion 
for Relief from Stay filed by the Debtor.  As an initial caveat, we have 
prepared this as the scrivener for the Group.  Like the rest of the Group, we 
have not specifically reviewed the substance of this with our client and we 
reserve the right to suggest changes based on our client's comments, as we 
expect the rest of the Group will.  In addition, we have the following 
comments:

1.  In carefully analyzing the Motion for Relief from Stay as part of 
preparing this Response, we became convinced that the Debtor meant that the 
preliminary injunction was to remain effective and does not intend to grant 
general relief from stay as to the Federal District Court action.  It seems 
to us that the Debtor is basically saying by this motion that we should 
proceed in front of FERC, but nobody has the prerogative, without seeking 
further relief of stay from the court, to proceed outside of FERC to resolve 
the charge-back issues.  Accordingly, we did not feel it was appropriate to 
address this issue in the response.  The Group may want to consider 
approaching Debtor's counsel on this issue.

2.  Technically, by asking the Court to include the Amendment 22 proceeding 
as part of the Relief from Stay, we are expanding the relief.  We have tried 
to soft sell this issue as was suggested by the Group to suggest that this is 
simply a related proceeding that is required to go forward to grant complete 
relief as part of the Debtor's motion.  If the Debtor objects to the expanded 
relief, the court will likely not grant it because it was not specifically 
the subject of the motion.  We probably need to lobby Debtor's counsel to 
help get this accomplished without the requirement of filing an additional 
motion for relief.

3.  Check Exhibit A to make sure that all parties are listed and the 
appropriate counsel is listed.  I am trying to simply list the ""bankruptcy"" 
counsel so that Debtor's counsel knows initially who to contact if there is 
any question relative to a party.  We have not intentionally left anybody 
off.  If someone is missing, it is inadvertent and we will certainly add them 
to the list.

If there are others of your Group who should receive this, please forward it 
to the other members of group.

We have set up a conference call at 12:15 E.T. to discuss this matter.  The 
dial-in number is 1-800-569-0883.  The confirmation number is 5096040.  If 
you have any questions prior to that time you may contact Carl Eklund in New

Please note that this revised calendar for the most part  
reflects?cancellations of meetings of work groups whose work has been  
temporarily suspended.? The areas of primary focus for the near term are  the 
congestion model and work on suspension of existing transmission agreements  
among Filing Utilities and the corresponding transfer payments and conversion 
of  rights.? Those working?in these areas may schedule additional meetings  
in April as needed.? There will be?one additional area of work during  April, 
which will involve taking an integrated approach to dealing with issues  
around tort liability, commercial liability, and credit worthiness and 
credit  risk.? Gary Dahlke sent out an e-mail?on this topic some weeks ago 
to  the people who participated in the Stage 1 work on the Agreement 
Limiting  Liability.? So far there are no scheduled meetings?for this 
additional  work effort, but we expect there will be some meetings scheduled 
during the  month of April.
?
Please be assured that the areas in which work is being  temporarily 
suspended?will be addressed; it is just a matter of marshalling  everyone's 
resources in the near term to the most critical tasks.

Thank you all very much for your helpful comments and  suggestions.

 I would have responded to your message sooner, but it has taken me
these several days to recover from it.  I am surprised and disappointed for
myself and the rest of us here.  You have been a mainstay of the energy
practice and indeed the entire industry for the several years that you have
been out here, and it is difficult to imagine carrying on without you.  Your
legal skills, knowledge of the industry and honest and honorable approach to
dealing with people have, frankly, made you indispensable and irreplaceable.

 That being said, I am happy for you.  I know that you hail from New
England, and you must be glad to be returning.  Western Massachusetts is a
lovely place, and you will be able to pick from any number of attractive
college towns, such as Northampton and Amherst, within an easy commute of
Holyoke.  ISO New England is fortunate to be getting you, and I know you
will thrive there.

 I hope that you will keep in touch, and I look forward to our paths
crossing in the near future.

1397,"There are increasing requests for IT development resources for databases and 
websites within the group.  There are two issues involved regarding this 
activity:  Enron Networks is now charging for such development, and the 
production of these many and various projects leads to high maintenance needs 
and projects are often abandoned after short use.

If you need a new database, it should be developed in one of the desktop 
applications that everyone has - Word, Excel or Access. Such 
documents/databases can be shared on the O: Common/Public Affairs drive.  If 
your needs are more complex than these applications will support, or if your 
needs are more global, an effort should be made to fit the data into the 
Project Tracking database.  Contact Elizabeth Linnell for this global 
database. 

Products/information to be published to the intranet should be placed on the 
existing Public Affairs intranet site. Having multiple sites is confusing to 
our customers and an ineffective use of resources, as well as expensive to 
develop and maintain.  Contact Earlene O'Connell regarding additions to the

1409,"Netiquette.  What's that?  

Well, in case you didn't know, Netiquette is the proper use of e-mail.  
Because we all spend a large portion of our day communicating with customers, 
vendors and co-workers via e-mail, here are some tips to help you polish your 
e-mail skills and send you on your way to Netiquette success. 

Short & Sweet
Keep your messages concise and to the point.

Cluless In . . .
The subject line can be a couple of words or a short phrase that gives the 
reader a hint to the contents of your message.

ARE YOU ANGRY?
The use of UPPERCASE text is the equivalent of yelling in the world of 
e-mail.  Lower the case and, thus, your e-mail voice.

Are You Still Angry!!!??
Watch out for excessive punctuation like exclamation points.  If something is 
important, put it in words, not exclamation points.

We Can Become Too Attached
Think of your reader and, whenever possible, put your message in the body of 
the e-mail rather than in an attachment.

Does Everyone Need To Know?
Be careful when you send replies to ""all recipients"" of an e-mail.  Ask 
yourself if everyone really needs to see your response.  If not, you'll be 
using up disk space, cluttering inboxes and slowing the mail servers 
unnecessarily.

Spellcheck Is Your Friend
Like printed documents, e-mail deserves a review to assure that grammar and 
spelling are correct.

Privacy On The Net?
There is no such thing as private e-mail.  Never send anything by e-mail that 
you would not want to see on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper.  There 
are no security guarantees with electronic mail.

Eyes Only In Cyberspace
Avoid sending any confidential or sensitive information via e-mail.  
Remember, it's very easy for someone else to forward messages you considered 
confidential.  Even messages sent as ""Confidential"" can be copied.

Quick Tips -- Refine Your Skills
Long paragraphs are hard to read.  Break them up into smaller ones of two to 
three sentences.
The use of abbreviations should be minimal.
When sending e-mail outside Enron, keep it plain and simple.  That means no 
elaborate use of formatting tools, such as bold, indent, etc.
Your e-mail signature should be the same one you use on printed documents.
Address people in business e-mail the same way you normally would in person 
or in a letter (e.g., Bob: or Ms. Smith:)
Sarcasm is dangerous to use in e-mail.  Remember, e-mail does not convey 
emotions."

a better job of managing company expenses.  Ask Kevin Hannon, CEO of Enron

1437,"CONFIDENTIAL  ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT

Sue, Joe, Mary:

As you can see from my other email, I took a wack at supplementing the 
EPSA/WPTF comments with some additional stuff on hyrdro.

I will try to get Tim Belden's read on whether my insert is important or not 
to include but I would appreciate your feedback too.

Re: EPSA's draft: It is very good.  My only comment is that, beginnign on p. 
3,  EPSA should more directly attack the concept of economic witholding.  
There really is no such thing (or it really is not different that physical 
witholding).  If you raise your price above the opportunity cost in the 
market, your buyer will go to that other resource and thus you won't be able 
to economically withold.

Re: WPTF, I am not sure what to say.  I apologize that I had not read 
carefully before our 1 pm call but the version I reviewed has some issues. I 
just don't think it will be received that well by the FERC staff. Other than 
amplifying the credit issue (probably in there at Sue's request) I am hard 
pressed to know why Enron would support it seperate from EPSA.

"
1444,"Mary,  I looked into your idea regarding using an index price approach along 
the lines of the tariff that was approved for EPMI's market based sales to 
PGE in Docket No. ER99-364-000.  I agree that the current situation is quite 
similar to that.  thus, since the current proposal is similar to one that has 
already been accepted, the matter is less controversial than I originally 
thought and I do not think that this would entail much additional research.  
Nor do I think that we necessarily need to pre-screen this with FERC since 
that would delay the filing.  I would therefore revise my RCR projection to 
$5,000 to prepare the filing and suggest that we simply file it.  (I would 
let you know if I think it is more complicated once I dig in.)

FYI, I ran this through Dan, and he agrees with the foregoing.  As before, 
however, we cannot get FERC approval within the time frame contemplated by 
the RFP.  I agree with you that the conservative and preferable (from a 
legal/regulatory perspective) way to proceed is to make your proposal to PGE 
subject to FERC approval.  Since time is of the essence, let me know when to 
begin, and we'll jump on it right away.  Ron

1463,"It has come to my attention that there has been some confusion regarding the 
Lobbying Questionnaire that I sent out on Feb. 20, 2001 and which is due on 
March 9, 2001.  Please note that it is NOT necessary to gather your expenses 
attributable to your lobbying activities rather I just need an allocation of 
your time/hours spent engaging in such activity during the year 2000.  I 
apologize for any confusion.  Thank you - Tara Rafter"

1465,I agree.
1466,"Thanks for the information.  It will be very useful to the team!

"
1467,"Thank you for your timely response to FERC's data request.  To date, I have 
received responses to questions 2-8.  The only oustanding items are responses 
to question #1 and a portion of #4 (unit identifier).  It is understood that 
the responses for #1 will be availalbe after September 15 and the additional 
information for #4 will be available this week.  We will look over your 
responses and call you if clarification or additional information is 
necessary.  We will treat as you requested #2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 as Confidential.

You were correct is responding only to the WSCC.  We did not purovidea 
separate data requests to Enron Wind.  In not doing so, what information are 
we missing from our data requests?  Please e-mail me a response to this 
questions.  For any other concerns please continue to use e-mail or contact

Here's the Outage information for LV. 

Let me know if there are quesitons.

1469,"In the Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation, 
March 2001, the FERC Staff stated that its proposed mitigation proposal is 
designed to apply only to approximately 5% of the market that remains in 
real-time and not to the bilateral and forward markets.  In addition, the 
December 15 order only established a reporting requirement for sales into the 
ISO and PX spot markets exceeding $150/MWh.  Under the order, the refund 
potential closes after 60 days of a utility filing its cost justification 
unless the FERC issues written notification to the seller that its 
transaction is still under review.  Note well that this does not entirely 
insulate EPMI concerning long term deals because the FERC's December 15 order 
is still pending rehearing and parties can appeal that order once the 
Commission rules.


"
1470,"Here's a copy of what we filed at FERC today.
"
1471,"Here's my solution.  FERC should tell the Cal ISO to file the stakeholder 
developed congestion management proposal arguing that it has been agreed to 
in the stakeholder process and that the ISO Board has no authority to do 
something else because they are not properly constituted.  We could also 
argue that the FERC should order the ISO executives to hire a consulting firm 
that will propose a slate of candidates and argue for a government similar to 
what has been proposed for RTO West.  This will help us in ultimately putting 
the West RTOs together.


"
1472,"Christi - Cara has E-mailed a number of questions to Linda and Kelley.  If 
she doesn't hear from them by tomorrow morning, can Cara and I have a 
conference call with you at 11:00 a.m. Pacific time so you can birddog people 
and get some answers?  In the meantime, if Cara E-mailed you the questions, 
would you answer any you know the answers to. Thanks.

1478,"  Thank  you  for  your  interest!!!                          
Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in  ""How to Collect Money Judgments""   .            '  s6  
If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and  why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income   .
If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.
You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.
Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.
""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""
The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between  200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money
Judgment debt   . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more
Judgments take its place.
We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.
With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.
By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.
The income potential is substantial in this profession.  We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year  . Some choose to operate out of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.
Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.
Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
  92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time   .
One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.
The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.
Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:
Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)
8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.
You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.
You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.
Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)
When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.
Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)
Quote's from several of our students:
Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course.  My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars   . Your
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened
doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.
Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of
judgments he is working on.
After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""  I am now making $2,000.00 per
week  and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now.""
After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""  I am now making $12,000.00   per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""
Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months""
From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:
With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.
None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!
If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.
  Please call us at  1--4 0 6 --6 5 2 --0 1 9 4  ..
We have Service Support   staff available to you from 8:00am to
9:00pm (Mountain Time) 7 days a week   . If you call this number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.
Thank you for your time and interest.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

 Here is a sample of just a few of the letters we receive every week 
thanking us for what our product has done:    
  ""I am astounded! The day before I started taking the GH1, 
I took blood tests. Then I began using the GH1 as directed. 
After 8 weeks I took blood tests again. 
My IGF-1 level (evidence of GH) showed a 70% increase! 
Furthermore, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144! 
I definitely feel better overall and certainly have more energy. 
To say the least I am very impressed and pleased with GH1. 
My ""biological"" age is now that of a 40 year old!"" 
-Dr. A. Zuckerman M.D., age 60, NY 
""A year ago, my blood pressure was 180/120 and I was on blood 
pressure medication. I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1. 
After a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80-- 
and I haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!"" 
-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA 
""After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher 
level of energy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision 
were enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and 
it seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill 
at the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and 
a change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, 
I only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra 
karate workout just to expend all the extra energy!"" ""After 6 months on 
GH1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down to 65! Also, my stamina has 
increased, as well as my energy and sex drive--this product is GREAT!"" 
-Dr. Richard Boyd, 78 years old, Harvard Clinical Psychologist, CA 
""As a straight-ahead bicycle racer, I used to have to wait a minute 
and a half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where 
I could sprint again. After a month on GH1, I can now sprint again 
after only 45 seconds! GH1 cut my waiting time in half!"" 
-Ed Caz, age 40, Fresno,CA 
""When I heard GH1 would reduce body fat increase lean muscle WITHOUT EXERCISE, I couldn't believe it--but in just a few months I lost 4 inches around my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--even though I gained 10 pounds! Also, after 4 months, my fine vision returned. I no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print."" 
-Larry Baker, age 54,Oceanside, CA 
""I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now. 
I have been under great stress in my business. 
I believe that taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 has had a big part in keeping 
my energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst 
of discouraging circumstances. Last week I came down with a cold. 
Colds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. I am progressing through those stages but more quickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. 
My muscles seem to have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more energy 
when I go out walking."" 
- Carolyn Munn 
""I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that 
I try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending 1,000 US dollars a month and needed 
a doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-Aging 
Formula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections. 
Thank you Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!"" 
-Rita Mills McCoy 
""I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested, 
in my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my levels 
dropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti-Aging 
Formula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its normal 
coloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of this 
without having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taking 
few sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow! 
-Alan Ross, 43 years old 
GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1 
available on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH. 
  WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)?   
Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which 
is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the 
endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically 
similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few 
hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones 
secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout 
the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. 
Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. 
The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously 
dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their original 
cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to 
store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the ability 
to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. 
Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. 
When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the 
all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance 
which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the 
proper dosage amounts. 
GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, 
melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are tiny 
chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate 
the activities of the vital organs. The word ""hormone"" is derived from a Greek word 
meaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the 
effects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other 
hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly 
reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including 
making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also 
helps restore hair color and hair loss. 
  
THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?   
Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its production 
gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls about 14% per 
decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is not new, 
its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and physicians 
have been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. 
Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only the medical 
profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another problem has been 
that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only 
effective administered through injections. However, a new technology developed by 
Anti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. 
  
  GH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61 
Growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. 
The amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. 
This results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age 
of 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, 
200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the ages 
of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in SDS, 
or Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disease called 
aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. 
Healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. 
Those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include 
an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen. 
After numerous clinical studies, the following was determined 
after 6 or more months of GH therapy: 
 _ Improved memory 
_ Regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and other organs 
_ Increased sexual drive and performance 
_ Increased fertility 
_ Enhanced immune system 
_ Quicker wound and fracture healing 
_ New hair growth and color reparation 
_ Sharper vision 
_ Improved exercise performance and tolerance 
_ Increased muscle mass without exercise 
_ Reduction of cellulite and fat 
_ Increased stamina and vitality 
_ Reduction in high blood pressure 
_ Improvement in sleep 
_ Anti-aging 
_ Wrinkle reduction and smoothing 
_ Decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol 
_ Increase in HDL (good) cholesterol 
_ Strengthening of bones 
  
 IS GH SAFE?    
GH has been successfully used in the medical community 
for over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years. 
Edmond Klein, M.D. and L. Cas Terry Ph.D., tested over 
800 individuals and reported in their 1995 study that 
GH had substantial benefits and no side effects.

1503,"Imagine how wonderful it would feel to help a large number of children in your area and making $4,000 to $12,000 per month doing it?                   {s13

Helping needy children and parents AND at the same time supporting your own family very well financially.

Every day in your community there are single parents struggling to make ends meet and wondering where the money will come from to cover their children's basic expenses.

Most of these parents are hard working people who just need help from the person who has a legal responsibility to give it to them.

Every day a large number of parents call us for help in collecting their child support.  Many more than we can possibly handle.  We need the help of caring and dedicated people who would like to enter a new high paying prestigious profession.

The court has decided how much these parents are to receive but the caseloads are so large that the results are that there is over $32 Billion dollars worth of uncollected Child Support in the US today and this amount grows by millions every week.

If you would be interested in helping us, then we have all of the training that you will need to start a new business in this high growth profession of ""Child Support Processing!""

We have the resources available to you to help you track down deadbeat parents and force them to pay what they legally owe, without ever having to come into contact with them!

We have the most extensive Computer Data Bases in the world for the processing of Child Support.  Our databases allow you to track down dead beats, find their assets and then collect the child support, which is due.  These powerful databases will be available to you if you choose to join us.

You can do what private investigators do, legally, and for a fraction of what it would normally cost! And you can do it from the comfort of your own home office!

More details about our Child Support Collection Course:

Child Support Collection has reached epidemic proportions, $32 billion nationally; state agencies are simply too understaffed!  State agencies are typically very happy when we assist a parent.  We find the dead beat and their assets and the state agencies are pleased to use their government powers, working with us, to collect the back child support.

Our Child Support Collection course teaches you to how locate the DEAD-BEAT parent, their assets, employment, bank accounts and how to collect on those assets.

The manual supplies the forms, brochures, and child support business methodology.

We also have the most powerful reporting capabilities at your disposal to help you track down dead-beat parents.

Unpaid child support is an epidemic . . . and you can be the cure!

As our national and local media remind us every day, millions of custodial parents are struggling to raise their families without the child support to which they are entitled. In fact, you or someone you know is probably tackling this problem right now.

This Child Support Collection Course teaches you to recover your own child support payments. Or you can learn to help others in need, earning about 25% to 30% of what is collected.  That translates to $4,000 . . . $8,000 . . .even $12,000 earned each month collecting for others! You'd be hard-pressed to come up with any other legal business opportunity that allows you to earn such a significant income while performing such a valuable community service.

Not only do you have the potential to make thousands of dollars a month recovering delinquent child support payments, you'll also ""earn"" the gratitude of custodial parents and their children who are finally receiving the money they're due!

You might be thinking a successful child support recovery business would require a difficult time commitment or a lot of expensive equipment. Not at all! You can make thousands of dollars each month, part-time or full-time, working from your home, with only a telephone and a home computer!

This course places you at the leading edge of a major national trend, namely, privatizing the recovery of delinquent child support payments. Whereas the government succeeds only one fifth of the time in this area, well-trained private parties are doing four times better!

And remember every time you recover a payment, you can earn 25% to 30% of what you find!

We provide step by step instructions for you to follow, enabling you to collect all back-owed child support for yourself or anyone else you choose. It is not necessary to have in-depth legal knowledge or even a college education.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, absent parents in the United States have a big bill to pay: $32 billion in delinquent child support payments. That is over 15 million cases, with 1.5 million new cases added every year. More than half of court-ordered child support cases become delinquent at some time, and in more than one fourth of cases, no payments are ever made.

Children deserve and need the support they have been awarded, but government agencies aren't offering any real help because they are totally over whelmed.. In fact, the agencies are so flooded with requests that they only collect about 18% of the child support money they go after. In other words, the government typically has an 82% failure rate! No private business could survive with that kind of record, and the impact on children can be devastating.

Statistics show that after a divorce, an absent parent's available income goes up 43%, while the custodial parent's spending money goes down 20%.

With your help, children in need have a four-times-greater chance of receiving the money they are due than if they relied on the government for recovery.

One mother has told us that working with the government to find an absent parent ""is like beating your head against a brick wall. The frustration and futility you feel are enormous. Agencies crawl at a snails pace, and authorities often lose files or seem to make no progress with a case."" But this same mother's outlook changed after reviewing our course: ""I would have given anything to have this knowledge years ago. This is the best $149.00 I have ever spent.""

1534,"Applied Finance - May 31-June 1, 2001 
in EB552   Cost:  $700.00

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but 
rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals 
contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with 
insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work 
that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to 
Enron's transactions.
R A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the ""deal space"" and 
how the financial principals discussed  relate to  Enron deals.
R The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron 
deal.

1535,"Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on

So what's happening today?  Are you involved in ranking stuff, like Kim?
That's all so much fun.  I think Armin and I should have a ranking meeting,
he would get some low marks in the courteous office behavior..when he gets
stressed he turns into...ISOLDE!!!! Maybe if I threaten his bonus he would
work to improve that one little imperfection.  And of course I need no
improvement in ANY catagory, I'm just perfect (I'm sure he will agree..ha ha
haaaa).  Angus would get the best rating from both of us, he is perfect in
our eyes.

I think Angus may be in trouble with the workers though...i let him out to
do his business while ago and the workers had their lunches sitting out, I'm
afraid to ask them if he helped himself to their food...he's really bad
about that!  He got on my desk one afternoon while Armin and I were outside
and dined on some M&M's that were in a cup on my desk...there were only like
5 in the cup and when we came back in, I found one partially licked one on
my desk and one on Armin's...of course he was sick that night.

We are finally getting warmer wetter again, oops that's weather in english.
I was able to take off my coat at lunch time, hopefully tomorrow the
thermals can go too.  I hope Julie has been having better weather in
Prague...but I think not.  Have ya'll heard from her?  I thought she might
call us since she's on the continent...

Did you tell her about talking to your parents?  She told me that she told
you her secret.  Were you surprised?  I actually guess who it was, but I was
surprised!  Last I heard she didn't know their status....did she ever find
out?

Well, write me!!!!

1554,"Hey guys!  It's been a long time, I hope everyone is doing well especially since I know it's the end of bid week and it's Friday.  Just thought you might enjoy some of the things I've learned since I've been here about the English language.   Hopefully they'll give you chuckle.  

There are differences between British English and American English that I've noticed so far:

Pants are ""trousers.""  Don't make the mistake that I did:   I wrote, ""Black Pants, Brown Pants, Khaki Pants"" on my dry cleaning inventory to turn into the dry cleaners and got reminded that I was turning in ""trousers"" not pants with a smirk.  ""Pants"" are what they call underwear here.  Also, I almost fell over in my chair laughing one day when a girl in my group said ""PANTS!"" and hit her hand on the desk when her computer crashed.  Apparentely, it's the equivalent of saying ""CRAP!""

I went to the grocery store around the block and I was looking to buy some orange juice.  On the outside of some of the containers it said ""with extra bits"" and some said ""no bits.""  I was puzzled until my boyfriend explained that it was ""with pulp"" or ""without pulp.""  

When I go to restaurants I have to remember that fries are ""chips"" on the menu (even at McDonalds), and chips are called ""crisps.""  If you want to get a baked potato it's called a ""jacket potato.""    And if you want mashed potatoes, just say ""mash.""  One of the favorite dishes at the pubs (not bars) here is ""bangers and mash"" which translates to sausages links and mashed potatoes.  

Here are a few more of the oddities:

You don't stand in line here, you ""stand in queue.""
Trash cans are ""bins.""  It's amusing to hear someone say, ""I don't want it- just bin it.""
Country boy or redneck types are called ""wide boys"" or ""barrow boys.""
When you spell things out loud, Z is pronounced ""zed"" and H is pronounced ""haitch.""
Cross walks are ""zebra crossings""  since they are signified by white stripes on the road.  (Pronounced ZEB-bra, not ZEE-bra)
Panty hose are called ""tights"" regardless of their thickness.
Good  is pronounced ""goote.""
Yards no matter how big or small are all called gardens regardless of the fact that they're not growing any vegetables in them.

Well, I guess that's about it for the English lesson for today.  I hope you are all doing great and I'll try to do better about sending updates.

Cheers!  ( ""Thanks"")
Angie"

It's like he's building up an immunity to the allergy medicine.  He's just miserable anytime he's at the house - obviously, that doesn't help a relationship.  So, starting tonight (?) they are going to move outside.  I'm gonna have to get them one or two (probably one) doghouse.  I'm so depressed about the whole thing.  Rayfael feels bad too, but it's important he not be near death anytime we're together.  He feels like the bad guy.  And I feel like a bad father!!!  I can't bear to think of their cute little faces staring in the french doors wondering what they did wrong!

I'm getting paid back for all the nasty things I said about Barbara Dillard and her dogs!!!  I want  you to move back and let Mr. Bean and Greta live with you and Angus!!!  Nextdoor!!!  (the house is still for sale! - $269,000 list now, down from $314,000).

1562,"I don't know if you got my email, I sent it to the office.  Here's what it said in case....

""Connie --

Actually, they reacted very well - or at least as well as can be expected.  They were sad, but not horrified or anything.  They respect me and know that it's not a choice.  It was just so weird, because I did not have any agenda or intention on telling them that at that point, we were just talking about stuff (and drinking) and I just told them.  And I told them, you can't be totally surprised by this - and they said no.  They had questioned it before, but had not wanted to offend me by asking.  At the same time, they were holding out hope that it wasn't true.  But now they know.  They didn't really have alot of questions or anything, but were just accepting of it.  I'm very happy to have it off my chest.

Sorry to hear about your stomach!!!  That doesn't sound fun at all.  I had a pretty bad hangover yesterday, because I drank profusely before durning and after the whole outing myself to my parents ordeal.

Scott""

So, maybe you already read that.  Anyway, is Armin getting alzheimers???  I don't have any big plans for the weekend.  I actually have a couple of dates, but nothing major.  I've made a couple of new friends, so I want to continue to cultivate those sort of relationships...if other types come up that's fine, but I'm not really concentrating on it.  But I had to go out and tell a couple of my new friends about my revelation to my parents.  A couple of them have not done it themselves, so everybody's all proud of me and stuff.  It's kinda funny really.  But it's like the one thing that was always your biggest concern just isn't there anymore.  I hope it was the right thing to do, but I feel like it was.  Hard to say whether it was good or bad for my mom.  But, honesty is the best policy, right?

iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

1589,"Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

1595,"I just now got a  reply that the email address Steve gave me does not work.  
"
1596,"That is not the issue.  By putting us in the middle between GTB and Solar we 
would be the ones that would have to resolve any differances between the wo 
if the unit does not function properly.  The whole deal gets complicated 
since there is a design engineer. oerator and equipment manufacturer and we 
get in the middle between the equipment manufacturer and owner.  If the unit 
does operate properly, everyone will point fingers at everyone else,  I have 
seen this happen coutless times on EE&CC projects.  Why do I want to take 
this risk on an international project that according to Jerry's own numbers 
gets me about $800,ooo in current perios earnings and another $400'ooo 
deferred over many years.  It just is not worth the time and risk for that 
kind of money.  I think Phil Lowry agrees with this assessment also."
1597,"
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

1600,"Eric,
Of course, the answer is yes.  The consideration of potential impacts to ""C=
ultural Resources"" is taken into account within the National Environmental =
Protection Act (NEPA); therefore, to say TW is ""commited"" to environmental =
stewardship would include that resource (although it is not generally under=
stood that NEPA would include it).  On the other hand, you make a great poi=
nt.  If you want to expand the TW's sensitive consideration with another se=
ntence to include other interests at this point (e.g., interested parties, =
landowners, regualtory bodies, etc.) that would be more reflective of the o=
pen concept we want to portray with the Sun Devil Project.  As a suggestion=
 you could probably say something to the effect that: ""TW will consider sug=
gestions and comments made by interested parties (e.g., environmental group=
s, landowners, agencies and others) in the development of a potential route=
 for the pipeline. This includes TW's commitment to develop the route in an=
 environmentally sensitive manner.""   John

1601,"I added two map slides, one with the SD overview, and one showing e- plants in development or under construction and their relative size.

 "
1602,"Dan,

When we originally discussed a physical gas contract with SMUD, I mentioned 
that we had sent them a contract in the past.  That is why I asked if we 
could incorporate some of the language from their long term contract in order 
to appear to be working with them.  Also, I was under the impression that you 
were working with Shari to incorporate applicable language from the 
agreements that we have come to terms with them on.  So, I guess using the 
standard agreement, which is not what I requested, might have been a waste of 
your time.

I understand that their contract language might be lacking and I didn't 
expect to use their contract in full.  ( He indicated that SMUD used language 
from one of Enron's old contracts?).  If you say that we can't use any of 
their language - that's fine too.   It just seems as though you sent a 
standard form without considering my requests.  I also need to be informed of 
the reasons we can't use any of their language so I can discuss this with 
them.  SMUD is one of the customers we have already missed opportunities with 
and if we can appear to work with them - it would be to our benefit.  Legal, 
as well as credit, is considered to be a part of the team that helps build 
these customer relationships.  I hope we can work with them on this agreement.

Thanks,

Kim

I have attached an omnibus confirm worksheet for a transaction with this 
counterparty.  We require a guaranty from their parent.  We recently 
transacted with this counterparty at which time we required the same 
collateral (Marie Heard worked on this).  They failed to provide the guaranty 
and unwound the positions.  Now they say they will provide the guaranty. At 
the time of the initial transaction they sent over thier format which Shari 
Stack reviewed and commented, which I have a copy of.  I feel we should 
attach a red-line version of this guaranty to the confirm for their review.

1637,"Hi Tana -  

We need your assistance in preparing termination letters for the transactions 
listed on the attached spreadsheet and described as follows:

On Friday, April 20, 2001, four transactions occurred on EnronOnline that 
were in error.  One transaction was with Coral Energy Holding L.P. and three 
transactions were with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.  As mutually agreed 
to by both the Enron commercial team and the respective counterparties, it 
was decided that each of the four transactions would not be confirmed and 
should be terminated.  

The exact specifics are detailed as follows:

? The transactions occurred due to an inadvertent entry in the actual 
production system of EnronOnline by a Product Control Group member, Melba 
Lozano.  Melba activated a product assuming that she was in the EnronOnline 
test system of EnronOnline.  

? The product transacted upon is normally managed by Frank Ermis.  However, 
in his absence on Friday, the product was managed by Matt Lenhart.

? Steve South, trader on the West Desk, called and notified both Morgan and 
Coral that the product had been posted in error.  All parties agreed that the 
transactions were not reflective of the normal pricing.  As a result they 
further agreed that transaction confirmations would not be necessary and that 
the deals would be ""killed"" on all sides.  (For reference of any telephone 
tapes that may need to be pulled, the conversations with the counterparties 
occurred around 2:00 pm.)

? No confirmations were generated as a result of the killing of the 
transactions in TAGG.

? I spoke with Mike Grigsby on Monday (April 23, 2001) and advised him that 
termination letters may be required by Legal.  He responded that he had no 
problem with that.

Tana, please advise if additional information is required to complete the 
termination letters or if another course of action is warranted.

Thank you,

Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this

made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement

like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the

place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and

we have correct names and credit on (you need to review this list which has

names or no approved credit yet ( so you don't need to approve this list).

You may ask, what products will these counterparties trade?  They can 
potentially trade all the products we offer online so you need to look at 
them like any new counterparty.  Saying that, what we really expect them to

1666,"I got back from vacation late Friday.  Our whole group got bumped from the 
flight in Paris so they paid us $700 each to take the next flight out.  Not a 
bad deal!  But it was 27 hours travel time from start to finish and I was 
exhausted.  Luckily, it was a 3 day weekend here, so I had time to recover 
(and clean from my construction work).

I had a really nice time.  Most of our time we spent in East Germany, except 
for the flight out of Munich.  We went to Berlin, Leipzig, Eisenach, 
Wittenberg, Erfurt, Potsdam, and hiked in the Harz mountains.  My favorite 
time was the time spent in Kitzbuhl, Austria.  It was wonderful, I hope to 
make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.  It is so hard to do 
anything like it in Houston, I forget how nice the mountains can be.  Our 
hotel was great, smack in the middle of town and it only cost $30, breakfast 
and dinner included!  Such a deal!  

I got home and my house is almost done.  There are only a few minor things

1669,"Ted,

Question 15 of the annual NYMEX hedge exemptions asks us to describe in 
detail:  ""the system of internal controls administered in the supervision of 
the applican't risk management programs, i.e., describe the risk assessment 
policies and procedures in place for evaluation and supervision of risk 
management programs, including ""stress-testing"" for extraordinary price 
volatility, and state frequency supervision is conducted.""

Attached is the response we have given the NYMEX in prior years.  Are there 
any changes in our procedures/control that would necessiate a change in that 
language?
"
1670,"We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement with the 
referenced Counterparty dated July 13, 2000.   A copy will be sent to Dave 
Samuels for the files.

Also, attached is an updated list of the Online Confidentiality Agreement for 
your review.  Please call me at x33399 with any comments or questions.
"
1671,"No, the City of Huntsville is not approved for financial trading  or physical 
power.  FYI< with the US based customer list (online and offline), we will 
never approve a governmental entity for financial trading unless we have a 
master in place, or time to do some due diligence on their authority to enter 
into financial transactions.  



"
1672,"Holly would be a good one to invite.  She and Carol are real good friends.  
Lucinda really doesn't know Carol all that well, so I think I'd skip her.  
Holly's work # is (281) 364-5207.



"
1673,"Tauton is ok for all products, except for financial products (it can do 
power).  David, when I talk about this I am never including credit 
derivatives unless Credit specifically tells us in their spreadsheet that 
this is a credit derivatives counterparty.



"
1674,"There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too."
1675,"Are they approval for ALL products, or only Australian products?

1680,"I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority, and he agrees that you 
do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as 
you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a 
control measure we're OK.

1681,"I spoke to Mary Solmonson about the chain of command in IT.  Obviously, 
everyone reports to Phillipe Bibi in the end.  She looked up Gary Bode, who 
Michael Neves, our Lotus Notes contact, reports to, and Gary is a Manager, 
but she didn't see his direct boss on the chart.  She suggested for the 
Fishkin Project that we try and use Inja Chun, a woman she says is very good, 
or Chris Behney.  (She said we could have her, but she would be very 
expensive!...just kidding!)  I'm going to give Danny Clark a call to see who 
at EES is using Documentum to manage their documents.  Perhaps we should set 
up a meeting to talk to Phillipe Bibi about the Fishkin project, so we make 
sure we get a good person assigned to us.   What do you think?"
1682,"I have already notified all the exchanges we deal with of the name change, 
but the NYMEX says the brokers have to file some form with the CFTC, and they 
can't file that form until they receive the notice from us."
1683,"Last week I left taped to your chair the referenced form of confirm that Bob 
Bowen needed you to sign off on.  He says he never hear back.  Can you call 
him and give him the sign off.  Thanks!"
1684,"In response to your email re:  Richardson Products II, this counterparty was 
approved for trading (without a master then in place) under my initial list 
of approved counterparties.  Per the email below, we then received in the 
signed master and the distribution was notified.
"
1685,"Kimball, Bay State and The Energy Authority were all amendments, even tho 
Credit didn't have them marked as such.  Kimball, I am ok with the change 
adding physical gas, they were previously shut down for financial and power, 
and no change there.  Bay State was previously shut down for financial and 
power, no change there, OK with adding physical gas.  The Energy Authority, I 
had previously shut down for financial, open for all power.  Now, per Leslie, 
have them open for US power sells only, so I'm changing that.

Hetch-Hetchy Water and Power is a division of the City of San Francisco, so I 
am shutting them down for all financial.

"
1729,"Pavel, Many thanks for your note.

I understand that Digitals are not core Enron business but as you know, I'm 
trying to explore Digitals to give, for example, a company a guaranteed 
income in year one (to mop up expiring tax losses). This  is offset by a 
guaranteed expense in year two. See attached hypothetical example. The 
digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to 
and would be part of a price risk management strategy, thereby giving it 
'commercial purpose'. 

I would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject --  the 
rational for using Digitals and  your knowledge of its use in other markets 
(electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector).

It seems to me that setting the srike is key and a 'value judgement' or am I 
wrong, and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate 
this? In any event, do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or 
likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it 
becomes non arm's length and does not pass the smell test?

Vince, Jarek suggested that you may be able to assist. Your views would also 
be appreciated.

I am favourably impressed by Martin. I think he's an intelligent person
and understands the power industry. He has good ideas about

I was trying to find ""fat tails"". I looked at NG prompt month prices' 
log-returns for 5 years  9 months.
On the figure below you can see the comparison of empirical cumulative 
probability function with normal 
cumulative for this time series (standardized: mean subtracted, divided by 
stdev). The effect of fat tails
is not pronounced so much. The ""fat tails"" effect was much more visible on 
your plot when you looked at the 
oct-00 prices log-returns versus my time series of prompt month's prices.
The shape of the distribution is different from normal, though, and fits well 
with the volatility switching model.

1735,"Hi Karolina,

The last word I got was that Grant Masson was still coordinating the contract 
and would be the person to talk to about getting a copy of the license.  I 
checked to see if I had an electronic copy somewhere, but couldn't find 
anything.  I suspect my copy was paper, and it would have been returned to 
Grant when I went back to Portland General Electric.  Probably didn't speak 
to the situation in London, anyway, because the real interest in London 
didn't arise until after I would have gotten my copy.

Grant is transitioning to his new job with El Paso in London, so if you have 
difficulty reaching him, check with Vince Kaminski, or if Vince is 
unavailable, Shriley Crenshaw.  Shirley may know the person in Enron Legal or 
Contracts Admin. who worked with Grant on the Henwood license.

Of course, Eric T. would have a copy.  If you run into problems with Houston, 
have Eric send you a fax.  (The license is relatively short as contracts go.)

Hope this helps,
Michael

regarding simulating power prices in VAR we might discuss the following items
and show some results:
1. Clustering for power:
 - clustering based on historical prices and correlations from them;
 - geographical clustering;
 - flexibility in choosing ""core curves"" (based on position size);
2. Jump-diffusion process for intramonth and prompt month:
 - parameter estimation from historical data (do we want to use it?)
 - working out parameters (jumps frequency, jump size) as stress scenarios;
3. Correlations within a cluster and across clusters.
4. Changing correlations estimations (using fixed contact' time series).
5. Joint estimation of factors for selected regions.

Let me know what you think should be in the agenda for this meeting.

                            I would  like to explore the opportunity to join 
Enron Investment Partners. I understand that Enron has $20 million fund set 
up to finance start-ups, and Gene Humphreys and his assistant John Godbold 
are trying to attract minority -owned start-up firms. I also learned that 
Enron has plans to increase the size of this fund to $200 million. I can find 
these opportunities for Enron around the Globe. Given my background as a 
Chartered Financial Analyst, with hands-on experience in investment 
management covering financial derivatives, fixed income, and equity, I can be 
a valuable resource to do the due diligence, origination, valuation, and 
monitoring of these start-ups. Would you please help me arrange a meeting 
with either Gene Humphreys, Ted Murphy, or may be Ken Lay?

I am pasting below the job opportunities open at Enron. I am also interested 
in these positions and would like to meet with the hiring manager.

I will give you a call to follow up.

Thank you.

 If you take a cab, ask them to take you to the College of Business
building at the corner of 21st and Speedway.  The main entrance to the
business school is on Speedway, across from the old gymnasium.  Come in the
main entrance, which has a large, glass structure, and you will be on the
second floor.  Go to your left and ride up the first set of escalators to
the third floor.  When you step off of the escalators, you'll be facing
north and continue in that direction through two sets of glass doors into
the northern side of the building.  This is where most faculty offices are
found.  My office is 3.218, which is in the northwest corner of the
building.

 If you have any problems, you should be able to ask directions from
most anyone in the halls.  I will look for you around 11:00 on Thursday, and
will be happy to provide any other transportation that you need.  Please let

  Exchange products seeing slow trading
  GAVIN SOUTER

  03/20/2000
  Business Insurance
  Page 3
  Copyright (C) 2000 Crain Communications, Inc. All rights
  reserved.

  Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have
  been somewhat slow to get off the ground.

  Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since
  the mid-1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a
  significant volume of trades.

  Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away
  from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains
  abundant and relatively cheap.

  As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major
  natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will
  remain limited, observers say.

  Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the
  limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he
  said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one
  contract against another.

  Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to
  establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has
  not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,
  capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in
  New York.

  The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not
  offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way
  to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified
  portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently
  offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that
  hedge, he said.

  Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then
  hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.
  stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane
  explained.

  The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to
  natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he
  said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop
  indexes, Mr. Lane said. ""For the insurance buyer, such exchange
  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but
  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a
  good surrogate,"" he said.

  The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for
  over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of
  catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.

  The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of
  exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior
  vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance
  brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.

  ""The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not
  looking for other ways of doing business,"" he said.

  At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar
  to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success
  since they were introduced in the 1970s. ""There is a belief that
  alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to
  predict when,"" Mr. Mooney said.

  Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves
  established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not
  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.

  Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities
  Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,
  however, and was suspended last year after two years of little
  activity.

  The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative
  products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board
  of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.

  Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft
  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge
  catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker
  at the CBOT who trades in options.

  No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT
  so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in
  the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were
  traded, Mr. Purty said.

  ""I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they
  really take off,"" he said.

  The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to
  trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance
  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative
  coverage options, Mr. Purty said.

  The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has
  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in
  mid-1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,
  chief operating officer.

  CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for
  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks
  and to build balanced portfolios.

  But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it
  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX
  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney
  said.

  Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of
  risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.
  Sweeney said.

  Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a ""cash for cover""
  exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange
  include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability
  coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where
  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry
  loss over an agreed threshold.

  Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible
  through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX
  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them
  form groups whose members do business only with one another.

  Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,
  totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,
  he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,
  insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their
  captives, Mr. Sweeney said.

  ""We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied
  with what we have achieved so far,"" Mr. Sweeney said.

  The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents
  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their
  existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was
  a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last
  year.

  Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field
  of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather
  derivatives .

  Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry
  Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.

  Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against
  weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in
  a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a
  resultant fall in revenues.

  The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,
  Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,
  Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering
  contracts based on cold weather.

  Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers
  themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more
  extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.

  In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for
  over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.

The fourth edition is here, and this month's theme is weather.
Weather derivatives is increasingly a hot topic on the web at the
moment. Four sites have been launched in the last three months,
including tradeweather.com, weather-risk.com and WeatherRiskAdvisory.com.
Along with the weather trading site from Liffe (I-WeX.com),
launched in January, and the introduction last September of
weather futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), there is
something of a rush on.

To provide you with an online resource to weather risk, we have
an introductory guide, two site reviews, 22 articles and an
exclusive book offer.

1767,"Hi Grant,

Hope all is well with you. I trust you got my message via the voicemail
that Ileft with Vince late Friday afternoon about my inability to travel -
I'm trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week's time when my ear has
cleared up, and I look forward to meeting with you one day.

I wrote to Vince last week asking for a favour, but I'm not sure ifhe is
there in Houston. I know that you guys are probably very busy but I was
wondering if you can write a few sentences for me. I'm sending out some
sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!) to my
request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an 'overview' of the
book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please
write a sentence or two for your chapter?

I'm including what I have already written (although I think it has changed
slightly from this version) so that you can see the style.

Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.



2 Overview of this Book

This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk
management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give
an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy
assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing
the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we
discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo
simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the
book.

In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing
empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model
the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean
reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and
showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.

Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson of Enron Capital and
Trade .

Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such
curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets
the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined
curves.  What we do in this chapter

Chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not-so-common derivative
structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses.  Examples of
products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors
and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian (or
average rate) options, Barriers, lookbacks, and ladder options.

Chapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot
price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives.  Closed form
solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option
prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter
including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate
model with jumps.

Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options
can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6.  Simulation schemes are
developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a
variety of path dependent options.  In order to price options which
incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is
developed.  This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward
curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard American style
options.

Chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on
modelling the market observed forward curve.  The approach results in a
multi-factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a
wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility
structures can be of an extremely general form.  Closed-form solutions are
developed for pricing standard European options and efficient Monte Carlo
schemes for exotic options.  The chapter finishes with a discussion of the
valuation of American style options.

Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions.
In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions
that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced
with the problem of managing the risk through time.  We begin with delta
hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma
hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7.  The general model of
chapter 7 ideally suited to multi-factor hedging and this is also
discussed.

Chapter 10 looks at the key risk-management concept of Value at Risk
applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios.  After
discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs
(volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.  We then
compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR; Delta,
Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation.  Finally, we
look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market
variables."

 Per the dialogue below, there seems to be some agreement between our two 
groups that a subscription to the ""Institute for International Finance"" is 
worth receiving, but to do so in one central subscription and split the 
cost.  Is a $16K share OK for your group?  We'll do $32K on our end, and then 
try and sell some of our share to my European counterpart once he gets better 
established with a bigger budget.

1777,"Vince,

Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with Wade Cline (COO, Enron 
India), Neil McGregor (President, DPC), and Mohan Gurunath (CFO, DPC) today.  
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your 
group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move.  I 
explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the 
Henwood study.

DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  There 
maybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issues 
that I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to 
Houston.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to 
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that 
before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.

I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things here 
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks.  Morale is quite down 
due to many lay-offs.

I am really looking forward to returning to Houston, and the family!!

Regards,

1779,"Steve,

Please, let  me know when you come back.
I have detected a tendency to implement different
approaches to valuation in the past.

To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal 
rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques
which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the 
originators to control the outcomes.

Today's focus: Service guaranteed

By Jeb Bolding

I spend a lot of my time at EMA focusing on service-level
agreements and the service-level management tools that attempt
to guarantee those contractual relationships.

Generally speaking, everyone - enterprises, xSPs, and ISVs -
are candidates for purchasing service-level management (SLM)
products to ensure their service-level agreements with their
customers. However, most toolsets on the market are in a
nascent period of development as they get a handle on how their
prospective customers want to see the reported SLM information
and what kind of action they want to take based on the metrics
they've gathered.

One thing we at EMA stress is that business transaction should
be the center of the service level agreement. While SLM tools
need to have a clear understanding of the integrity,
performance, and availability of components that support that
transaction, ultimately, the goal of SLM tools is to provide
the data and the automated actions that will guarantee a
consistent user experience.

As straightforward as this goal may sound, the vendor landscape
in support of this is quite scattered. Most vendors have a
product roadmap that leads toward a business transaction
monitoring solution, but many are still heavily focused on
providing detailed metrics about components, regardless of
their impact on the business process.

Assuming that an xSP has deployed some good, business-focused
SLM tools, things will still go wrong, transactions will be
lost, content will not be served up properly, and users will
leave because performance doesn't meet their expectations.

Since an xSP's business is dependent on its digital presence
always being there, xSPs need to implement solutions that
engage the user while there are problems so that the users
don't simply disappear into the Internet.

One potential solution that I've come across is a product
called RainAssure, created by Rainfinity. RainAssure software
sits between a company's Web servers and the switch or load
balancer.

RainAssure correlates transactions to faulty infrastructure
components, and as it watches the transactions coming into the
site that are answered by 404 errors or incorrect content, it
serves up configurable Web content designed to ensure user
experience continuity.

For example, in a faulty financial transaction series,
RainAssure could display pages that provide the users with a
mirror of where they were in the transaction process and then
either a phone number or e-mail address that they can use to
complete their transaction.

Alternatively, a Web page could be displayed that tells the
user there was a problem completing the transaction, but that
their session state was maintained and if they should retry
their transaction submission once again.

Finally, on the administrative side of things, RainAssure
provides detailed reports of completed and incomplete or
""dropped"" transactions. In this way, xSPs can tie direct
dollar value to the transactions that they support, and more
importantly, RainAssure can provide financial value to
transactions that were not completed.

In the end, SLM tools are there to give IT some breathing space
for fixing the problems that occur along their infrastructure.
If a technology solution can give IT an extra 10 minutes to fix
a problem while still engaging an online customer, that
technology has done its job.

As a result, we are trying to determine how much people should carryover from last year, generally 40 hours is the maximum.

Dear Convention Speaker
 
I am writing concerning the GARP 2002 Convention,  which will be held at the Roosevelt Hotel, New York on 11th to 14th February  2002.
 
This is just a gentle reminder that speaker  presentations should be e-mailed to me by Friday 14th  December to ensure that they are placed in the delegate packs. I am  sure that you can appreciate that with over 80 speakers, this is a massive  logistical task and requires advance planning. After this date, I can not  guarantee that they will be included in the delegate packs.
 
Moreover, if you have not yet returned you  speaker checklist by fax, can you please return this as soon as possible.  Also, if you are staying at the Roosevelt Hotel, please complete the hotel  form and fax it directly to the hotel. If you do not have a form, please  do e-mail me and I will forward one to you.
 
Finally, if you would like the brochure to  be received by any financial or risk professionals, please do provide me  with the names and any contact details (e-mail or postal address) and  I will ensure they receive a copy. 
 
If you have any questions or queries please do not  hesitate to contact me. I look forward to receiving your presentation next week  and to meeting you in New York in February.

news regarding explosive sales for the Company.
There will be huge volume and a strong increase in
price for several days. The same groups that featured
ONNN will begin coverage on CBCI. ONNN exploded from
$ 1.94 to $4.13 in six days.  We know for certain that
the same groups are going to feature CBCI and even better
returns are expected.

CBCom, Inc. (CBCI) is the largest and fastest growing
non-government owned ISP and Internet services company
in China.  CBCI, our top undervalued HOT PICK, is the
only Company of its kind to trade on a US Exchange.
Revenues are Exploding due to booming Chinese Internet
growth and CBCI's aquisition of many of its competitors.

We are very proud that we can share this information
with you so that you can make a profit out of it. It
is highly advisable to take a position in CBCI as soon
as possible, today before the market closes or tomorrow.

The stock could easily reach $4.00 in less than a month
on the strength of their upcoming contract announcements
and Strong Analyst Buy Recomendations.

When word gets out this stock will SOAR!

1824,"I believe all of you received a request from Jeremy Blachman to hold the 
afternoon of January 10th open for an off-site to discuss the manner in which 
RAC and Research assess/test the credit quality of EES transactions.   I 
realize that RAC and EES have had many discussions as to the methodology, but 
it might be helpful for all of us to understand the actual derivation of some 
of analysis.    Please call me with any questions or comments at ext # 30349.

The agenda will be as follows:

12:00 - 1:00 Lunch
1:00 - 3:30   Presentations
3:30 - to close  Discussion

RAC/Research Presentations

The following topics would be of interest to EES:

1 -  The derivation of default probabilities including  (Research)
 - - a discussion of the actual mathematical process,
 - - the analytics behind why these computations are deemed the best for 
Enron,
 - - a comparison to historic default rates and why they differ (in respect 
to actual default rates, shape of the cumulative default curves etc.

2 -  The volatilities which are used to determine possible loss scenarios for 
the commodity portion of EES deals including (Research)
 - - the selection of curves
 - - the application of those curves to the actual credit reserve model and
 - - why these particular tests are applicable to our products.

3  -  The recovery rates used in the credit reserve model.   How are these 
figures derived? (RAC)

4  -  How RAC and Research have adjusted the credit reserve model to 
accommodate unusual aspects of the deal including  (RAC)
 - - promotion payments,
 - - accounts receivable
 - - committed capital
 - - and other factors



EES also understands that some of you may be familiar with our processes, 
however, there are perhaps areas that you would like to understand more 
fully.   Please tell us what you would like to hear from us.

Also, RAC has sent us the credit reserve model and I have seen completed 
models.   Perhaps prior to our meeting on Wednesday,  someone from RAC and/or 
Research could sit with me and someone from Phil Layton's group and go 
through the process of how the various pieces are put together.

1828,"Mark Lay:  I shared confidentially with Vince Kaminski my developing
concept of a highly inefficient not-for-profit enterprise with
dramatically increasing costs.  I believe that a for-profit economic
model is possible that should reverse these skyrocketing costs and
ultimately lower the commodity thereby having a national, if not, global
impact of health care costs.   Vince seems to also believe in the
concepts potential.  The CEO of one of the biggest U.S. blood banks has
already asked to become involved.   I would like involve more people
with vision, means and desire to help make this a reality.  I would look

1830,"Vince- I spoke with London just now.
Here is what I gather Vuthy said about Howard Haughton.
********************************************************
1. He wants a second-round (another interview with Enron)- but, with high 
officials (Senior Management, this time).

2. He didn't think the interviewers were understanding his technical 
abilities and language.

Good News: He (Howard) wants to come back for another interview. I was lead 
to believe it went well although, Howard believes in protocol.

Bad News: Howard in on vacation now for 10 days.

1839,"Vince and Ravi,

Attached below is the resume of a student graduating from the University of 
Chicago with an MS in Mathematics.  His specialty is financial mathematics 
and his coursework seems to have covered a lot of the sorts of things that I 
understand your group to do, Vince.  He is extremely interested in Enron and 
contacted me because I am an alum of the College at the U of C.  I gather he 
didn't go through Enron's typical recruiting process for Analysts or 
Associates because his background is more technical, than commercial.  He 
acknowledged that his business experience is limited and from his resume you 
can tell that he is young.  He would therefore be willing to start as an 
Analyst or whatever the equivalent would be for a non-rotating position, but 
his interest is in doing the kind of work that you do, Vince, and Ravi, I 
know you have a similar background.  

Please let me know if this candidate would be of interest to either of you.  
If so, feel free to contact him directly.  He would like to start work this 
summer after graduating in June.

Thanks for your time and I hope this is useful to you.

Steve Leppard informed my today that he will be moving to Enron Metals.  I

innovations in Monte Carlo valuation of options with early exercise.  We
would like to illustrate our techniques on some examples which look

1844,"Greg,

Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.

1. Joe Carson. I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson.
     Enron  badly needs a senior economist of his stature and 
     experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent 
     Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old 
     shoulders.

     One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is 
between
     maintaining  his contacts and working closer with the desks. 

2. Tony Mends. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of 
using the skills of Tony Mends.
    Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very 
smart
    and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that 
relies
    on processing huge volumes of information.

We worked with him quite a bit for a while, as did Vince Kaminski and Stinson 
Gibner, on this project.  Well, he has finally graduated and is in the 
process of having his thesis published.  He has offered to come down to 
present his findings to anyone interested, so I am inquiring as to your level

Thanks for the information.  Chaim and I were aware that you might be
changing roles at Enron.  I am delighted Kim is slated to take over the
reins working with Vince.  Kim has put in a good bit of time in the past few
years reviewing our stuff and setting up contacts for us in your company.
We will give Kim a call early next week after Easter.  We have made a lot of
progress on MarketPoint, which I think will be of keen interest to your
team.  The introductory activity as well as the ongoing, inhouse
architecture are both improved relative to what you and your people were
able to review, and I anticipate you will be pleased and impressed.

John, it isnt that easy for you to get away from us!   Remember the story of
the tar baby.  (Just kidding.)  All the best, and I hope we get the chance
to serve you and make your organization even better.

This is a summary fo the report submitted by the Godbole Committee appointed 
by the state government to review the Dabhol project.

The report clearly suggests renegotiation on the tariff.  A lot of what they 
mention is something we won't agree to.  However, to me it seems apparent 
that this can be worked out.

Talking to the staff in London, I heard that Lynda Clemmons and a few of the 
key Weather Desk members left to start their own business.  I am hearing that 
London may gain more independence from Houston and gain its own book and, 
interestingly, also having ideas about developing the insurance/ insurance 
derivatives market.  I therefore thought this might be a useful opportunity 
to formalise a gradual transfer of responsibility for weather deal pricing 
from Joe to myself plus start talking to Vasant about the new markets on the 
insurance side.  I will call you later to discuss this with you.

"
1877,"Hi Niclas,

I am in the middle of preparing some presentations right now, so it might be 
more productive to speak by phone (503-464-8430).  Please leave your number, 
if you get my voicemail.

To get you started, you might see if you can get access to the FERC GADS 
database of plant forced and planned availability.  It seems others in 
Research have asked about this, so you may already have this at your 
disposal.  The EIA has a good electronic database of plant FOR and POR 
available for free (http://www.nerc.com/~esd/).  I know Alexios in RE/EES has 
this.  If you wanted to do it the hard way, you can also ask Jaison to access 
the EPA's CEMS data he has summarized on a machine there in Research.  It 
contains hourly plant operation for every unit over about 50MW, which you 
could aggregate up.

The WSCC 10-year forecast of new plant construction and loads is a good place 
to start for plant construction information, but suffers from some notorious 
""self-reporting"" error.  It is available in pdf form from the web site 
http://www.wscc.com/.  Other sources that should be more near-term, but more 
accurate are the CEC inventory of plants (http://www.energy.ca.gov/) and the 
BPA Whitebook (http://www.transmission.bpa.gov).

As far as basic economic data is concerned, you can either rely on the 
reported utility forecasts for loads, or you can go to fundamental data.  The 
ultimate source of the census data collected by the US Dept of Commerce, 
which you can buy on CDROM for cheap.  It would have this kind of information 
by SIC code, by ZIP code.  You may also have access to one of the economic 
forecasting businesses (Wharton's WEFA, DRI, etc.)  They have this in highly 
digested and complete form.

BTW, Tim Heizenrader, who runs Fundamental Analysis and Research on the West 
Desk, is a sharp cookie and should have all this under control.  Is your 
client aware of this resource?

Give me a buzz and we can talk more,
Michael

"
1879,"I read the chapter. Generally,
I like it, and find it non-controversial
and well written. Of course, this is
a huge topic and there are things
that you haven't discussed.

I thought the amount of attention
paid to OLS and MLE estimation
was a bit overboard, given that you
didn't really exploit it in your
results. If you were to state
the likelihood function for
the GARCH model, it might justify
the amount of attention to
gave to estimation for
simple iid processes, which could then
be thought of as a simple lead-in
and intuition builder to
the more interesting models that
you do actually use.

By the way, in your discussion of
smiles, you discuss fat tails
extensively. At least for equity markets,
while fat tails contribute, they don't do very
much at all compared to the effect
of risk premia, which you allude to briefly,
using supply-demand language, at the
end of that section.

For the impact of risk premia, see
Jun Pan's paper, which is available
from her web page. But she covers
only SP500, (as do most studies),
and your markets are obviously much different.

The chapter will be a good service to your readers!

1883,"Meet the head of the leading firm in our business.

Imagine the opportunity!

Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run 
the  company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North 
America.

So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a 
co-owner assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or 
three.

To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with a 
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower's wares.  You do an IPO and take in 
about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO is over and the quiet period 
it required.  But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your 
energy at the best price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get 
up front 30 Enron-trained   risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine 
having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene 
Lockhart,  most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before 
that president of BankAmerica's Global Retail Bank with its consumer, 
commercial and small business banking services delivered through 3,000+ 
branches.

Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.

Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in detail 
(to read the full story see attachment):

? How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is the 
heart of NewPower's business plan?
? How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
? How he's going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a million 
by the end of 2001.
? What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What figure 
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
? Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest the 
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated 
retail  marketer in the US.
? How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
? What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
? What does he see as his biggest challenge?
? Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
? Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
? What's the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
? Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bill, 
what kind of margin can it make now?
? How do higher prices help NewPower?  ""We're actually in a very good 
position given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our 
favor ... ""
? ""We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a 
bill, collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone 
else in the industry by several orders of magnitude.""

2. Proper documentation for easy maintenance and ability to quickly adapt to 
meet future needs, and
3. Security/access control to the files.

The first stage in this process is to take inventory of what we have: I am

1940,"Legislative package only delays pain, critics warn 
By Craig D. Rose 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
September 1, 2000 
Consumer and political leaders -- as well as Sempra Energy's chief executive 
-- said yesterday that the three electricity bills before Gov. Gray Davis do 
nothing to fix the fundamental cause of soaring bills. 
The cause, they say, is that power generators can continue to charge what 
most characterize as exorbitant prices for their electricity -- and consumers 
ultimately face the daunting task of paying them. 
No matter if all of the bills are signed, the leaders say California's power 
market will remain a seller's game that gouges overmatched consumers. And 
while San Diego Gas and Electric Co.'s hard-pressed customers may pay less 
now, they will pay back all or nearly all the savings -- plus interest -- 
beginning in 2003. 
""The governor's bill postpones the pain, but the pain is still there,"" said 
Maureen O'Connor, a former mayor of San Diego who has been active in seeking 
relief from the soaring bills afflicting SDG&E's 1.2 million electricity 
customers. 
The rate bill promoted by Davis and now awaiting his signature will have 
SDG&E's customers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, or 
70 percent more than what they paid as recently as May. 
Power companies, however, will continue to charge the customers as they have; 
presently, they're charging about 21 cents per kilowatt hour for SDG&E 
customers. The difference between 6.5 cents and whatever prices above that 
level emerge from the state's volatile power market will be recorded as IOUs 
for each customer in so-called balancing accounts. 
A second bill before the governor could provide up to $150 million in state 
money to help pay the balancing accounts, but the bulk of the IOUs will 
almost certainly be paid by SDG&E customers themselves when they become due 
in 2003 or 2004. A third bill before the governor would speed the 
construction of power plants. 
So while the rate bill lets customers pay less now than they owe, it 
obligates them to pay the balance with interest later. 
The situation creates the potential for a troublesome compounding effect: The 
higher electricity prices grow, the more is set aside in the balancing 
accounts -- and the greater the wallop to customer wallets when the accounts 
come due. 
Based upon prices now paid for future electric deliveries, Sempra Energy 
estimates customers will owe $664 million by 2003. IOUs of that magnitude, 
said SDG&E, will require that customers pay a surcharge of $40 monthly for a 
year on top of whatever they are already paying for their power bills. 
Keep in mind that typical residential bills at this time last year were about 
$55; they now stand at about $130. Consumer advocates say it's likely power 
prices will remain at levels that will lead to huge debts for customers under 
the Davis proposal. 
""The generators have shown themselves to be unconscionable in extorting 
profits,"" said Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, a San Francisco-based 
consumer group. 
Hoge said the bills that emerged ""seemed the best a corrupt system could spit 
out."" She added that TURN and other groups will shift their focus to 
pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restrain the electric 
generating companies and wholesale power markets. 
FERC, she said, must legally determine if charges from generating companies 
are reasonable. TURN and other groups will also press for re-regulation of 
the industry and will begin to explore municipally owned generating plants. 
Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network supports the Davis 
bill, although he said it won't fix ""the almost irreparably broken California 
energy system."" 
""The problem is that California's electricity customers have been subjected 
to market prices in a dysfunctional energy market,"" Shames said. ""It's a 
market controlled by the sellers of power and their cronies."" 
But Shames said the Davis bill provides at least temporary protection against 
further rate shocks, and he expects taxpayers across the state will 
ultimately assist SDG&E's customers in paying their electricity bills. 
But Jamie Court, executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and 
Consumer Rights, which has called for re-regulation of the industry, opposes 
the rate-cap legislation. 
""This keeps ratepayers and taxpayers on the hook for the costs,"" said Court, 
who added that the bill also locks in near doubling of power rates compared 
to last year. 
Stephen Baum, chief executive officer of Sempra, said the bill puts SDG&E -- 
a Sempra subsidiary -- in the position of financing the difference between 
what power companies charge for their power and what it collect from 
customers over the next three years. 
The balancing accounts, Baum said, could grow so large that they will 
challenge Sempra's ability to borrow to cover them. 
""The problem is with the wholesale markets,"" said Baum, who today becomes 
chairman as well as chief executive of Sempra. ""This legislation does nothing 
but postpone a big bill."" 
He added that Sempra believed the bill included ambiguities that could be 
illegal if not later clarified by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
""If (the PUC) can't or won't, then I think the legislation is legally flawed 
and can't stand,"" Baum said."

Electricity consumption grew by 24 % in same period

Jennifer Thome looked into the numbers and has provided the following:

Most of the media and wire stories use the CERA numbers
According to Margaret Carson, there are two main problems with CERA's 
numbers:  1) consumption includes the entire WSCC region; 2) economic growth 
figures are in 1996 dollars
CEC and other CA state agency sites do not provide much updated information 
and Margaret indicated that the state is reluctant to highlight its high 
growth and consumption rates.

1947,"SBX 6 (Burton), which would establish a PPA, passed out of the Assembly
Energy, Costs and Availability Committee moments ago on a party line
vote.  There were clarifying amendments taken which we will send out as
soon as they become available.

Supporters included: organized labor, Sierra Club, municipal utilities,
PCL, TURN, UCAN, AARP, Gray Panthers, Foundation for Consumer and
Taxpayer Rights.  IEP also testified in support of the bill but did
request amendments to clarify the eminent domain provisions.  The only
opposition came from a single private citizen.

Committee Chair Rod Wright  pointed out that up until recently LADWP had
among the highest rates in the state and that rates in New York are even
higher.  Consequently, he believes that the purpose of the PPA is to
ensure reliability, not to lower rates and that those who claim rates
will go down with the PPA will be sorely disappointed.  Assemblyman
Wright also highlighted the tremendous amount of private capital
currently entering the state and suggested that this bill must not be
used to supplant this capital.  He also implied that a state bureaucrat
must not run the PPA.

According to State Treasurer Phil Angelides who drafted the bill, the
intent of the state would be to provide anywhere between 5,000 to 7,500
in new capacity or conservation measures with $5 billion in bonds.  He
also indicated that the state would sell its power at cost based rates
which are specified in the amendments.

In 2000 we operated 5 1/2  aircraft  a total of 4,375hrs.  Net the chairman's 
office we did 354hrs of personal usage (Lay 280hrs)  

We will not experience the down time in 2001 like we did in 2000 for major 
scheduled inspections so consequently additional hours could be flown above 
the norm without additional manpower more than we had in 2000.  I estimate we 
could still operate at last years total hours due to the fact we still have 
more than our budgeted 5 aircraft.  Once we have disposed of the surplus 
aircraft we may need to adjust the available personal use hours down slightly 
due to availability around business needs.  As long as the personal aircraft 
users are flexible with their time and dates I don't see a problem.

"
1954,"A few updates, clarifications and suggestions:
To be clear, the Group of Ministers has not approved any specific draft.  
They deliberated on various concepts, which approved concepts have been 
incorporated into the NCAER Draft VII.
It is our understanding that, just prior to his hospitalization, the late 
Minister instructed his Ministry to support the NCAER draft.
The Prime Minister has assumed the role of Minister of Power until a 
successor to Mr. Kumaramangalam has been appointed.  I'm sure you are aware 
of the dynamic role the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has played in the 
telecommunications reform in India.  The same kind of dynamic role should be 
played by the PMO in power reforms.
Mr. N.K. Singh is the Secretary to the Minister and was the person who 
actively worked on the telecommunication reforms.  If the Secretary of Energy 
has an opportunity to indicate to Mr. Singh (and certainly the Prime Minister 
if possible) the need for the Prime Minister's Office to become active in 
promoting power reforms and the advisability and need to support Draft VII of 
the Electricity Bill, it would be most helpful.


"
1955,"In light of the Commerce Committee Hearing and the FERC Hearing on the 11th 
and 12th, wanted to provide a quick synopsis of the CPUC Hearing in SD.

It was the same quasi-legislative format as the previous hearing.  Speakers 
were invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could 
cross-examine the witnesses.  Commissioners Lynch and Wood presided.  Michael 
Kahn, chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated 
in some cross-examination as well.

Speakers were:

ISO:  
Kellan Fluckiger, COO
Anjali Sheffrin, Director of Market Analysis
Frank Wolak, Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee

Cal PX:
David Jermain, former VP, Compliance, Audits & Reg. Affairs
Seth Wilson, 

South Coast Air Quality Management District:
Carol Coy, Deputy Executive Director

CPUC:
Harvey Morris, Principal Attorney

SDG&E:
Donald Garber

ISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the 
wholesale market:

 1.  Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99, 99-00)
 2.  Lack of generation additions in entire west
 3.  Reduced imports of electricity from NW, due to low hydro and policy to 
retain water in spring.
 4.  Natural Gas price increases over 1999, at almost 2x's 1999 levels in 
August
 5.  Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound
 6.  Increased underscheduling from June-August

ISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) 
have increased the overall cost of electricity, with the highest total 
cost/MWh ($180) experienced in August, relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 
in July.  Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be 
interpreted as generator profit) in peak hours, but supply costs have been 
driven up in lower load hours.  

While ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC 
to be set price caps, also raised concerns about the affect any further 
reductions would have on the market.  They conclude that such a reduction 
would deter new investment,  preclude generators from recovering fixed costs 
of production, and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower 
imports).

ISO staff will make a proposal to the ISO Board, October 6, to do the 
following:

1.  File for extension of price cap authority to FERC.
2.  Request FERC to institute mandatory forward contract requirement on 
generators for a significant portion of their capacity.
3.  CPUC should allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and 
hedged by UDCs
4.  CPUC and state should promote price responsive demand programs
5.  Maintain sufficient planning reserves.

ISO Staff also stated that:

1.  Need to create disincentive for underscheduling for load and generation
 a.  Charge OOM cost to underscheduled load
 b.  Charge replacement reserve cost to underscheduled generation
 c.  Additional charge for real-time market transactions

2.  Attract and expedite new resources

MARKET POWER:

While the Commissioners spent the majority of the day picking apart the 
underlying reasons for the rise in prices, the conclusion of the hearing was 
President Lynch asking the ISO and PX to name names on who has been exerting 
market power.  Both the PX and the ISO said that it would be impossible to 
determine from the information they have.  Secondly, the analysis they have 
done show that no single market participant is consistently exhibiting the 
ability (opportunity) to exercise market power.  Therefore, at one point or 
another, nearly every market participant has market power.

Wolak suggested that in order to reduce the amount of market power in peak 
periods, require forward contracting OR increase profit incentives in 
off-peak period, where generators many times sell below short-run marginal 
costs.

No further quasi-legislative hearings are planned."

San Diego Union-Tribune, 12/12/00

Colombia's Medellin Utility Appeals Isagen Ruling, Paper Says
Bloomberg, 12/12/00



Energy costs rocket, handing consumers biggest shock yet 



By Craig D. Rose 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
December 12, 2000 
Power prices in California keep hitting new heights, with prices in the 
state's main electricity market rising today to nearly $900 per megawatt 
hour. 
The rise continues a stunning ascent from a price of about $50 per megawatt 
hour as recently as last spring. In retail terms, today's prices -- if 
sustained for a month -- would result in an average residential power bill of 
more than $450. 
San Diego ratepayers are temporarily shielded from such high bills by a 
rate-deferral plan in effect at least until 2002. 






The latest prices represent a more than tripling in posted prices on the 
California Power Exchange since Friday, when the operator of the state power 
grid removed a state-mandated price cap of $250. 
The latest escalation -- which comes despite improvements yesterday in state 
power supplies -- is deepening the sense of crisis among state officials, 
consumer advocates and utility companies. 
Nonetheless, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, who met yesterday with top 
energy advisers in Los Angeles, said it was unlikely there would be action to 
address the crisis at the state level until after federal regulators release 
their plan for California. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to issue a final order 
regarding California's market at its meeting tomorrow. But yesterday the 
commission made plans for a second meeting Friday to deal with the state's 
problems, and did not clarify at which session it would issue the California 
order. 
Davis and others in the state have been critical of FERC's refusal to halt 
what they describe as a devastating rise in power prices here or to order 
refunds for payments made by consumers over the past summer. 
The governor also has been severely critical of the California Independent 
System Operator's decision to lift the state price cap last week. The ISO 
manages most of the state's power supply. 
Privately, most at the state level remain skeptical that federal action will 
ease the crisis, saying it will be up to California to fix the problem. Last 
Friday, FERC quickly approved the ISO's plan to end the price cap. 
Increasingly, state officials and consumer activists are talking about 
state-owned power systems, utility takeovers and a likely initiative seeking 
to overturn deregulation. SDG&E and others also emphasize the need for a 
price cap for the Western region of the United States, in order to prevent 
suppliers from migrating to the highest prices and driving prices upward 
everywhere. 
The new highs in electricity prices came even as the ISO said the state's 
supplies had improved, with the start-up of production from a formerly closed 
nuclear power plant unit. 
The apparent contradiction between the increase in available power and the 
continued price escalation was blamed on a number of factors: 
High prices for natural gas -- which fuels power plants -- continued to drive 
up the cost of generating electricity. Cold conditions in the Midwest helped 
push natural gas prices to record highs yesterday. 
Allegations also persist that energy companies have manipulated the market. 
Consumers Union and other advocacy groups say deregulating electricity prices 
has proven to be a costly error for California consumers. 
At the same time, the controversial removal of price caps in California is 
allowing prices to rise to levels approaching those in other Western states. 
""We've now had three days of the Hebert experiment,"" said state Sen. Steve 
Peace, D-El Cajon. Peace was referring to Curt Hebert, a FERC commissioner 
who opposes price caps for wholesale electricity. 
Peace, who played a prime role in California's deregulation legislation, 
likened the run-up in electricity prices to the oil embargo of the 1970s and 
warned that it could devastate the economy. 
""Someone from (former Gov. Pete) Wilson's administration told me, 'Somebody 
in the energy business decided it's time for a depression,'?"" said Peace, who 
has also been critical of FERC's failure to rein in prices. ""This is not 
about electricity. It's about the economy."" 
In a letter to FERC yesterday, Peace repeated earlier calls for a federal 
order returning the state to regulated power prices based on the cost of 
production. 
Market watchers said little could help the state over the next few days, 
except Mother Nature. 
""The prices will remain at these levels, unless you get a warming trend,"" 
said Alex Galatic of Strategic Energy, a Pittsburgh-based energy company with 
offices in Carlsbad. 
Market speculators appear to be betting against a break in price any time 
soon. For example, electricity is selling for $800 per megawatt hour in the 
Pacific Northwest for delivery in January, Galatic said. 
""I see no break in the pricing,"" agreed Arthur O'Donnell, editor of

A spokesman for Enron Corp., the largest electricity trader in the United 
States, said the raising of prices in California had improved supplies 
available to the state. And he added that there was another positive aspect 
to the higher commodity prices. 
""You are starting to see some demand response,"" said Mark Palmer, the Enron 
spokesman, referring to cutbacks in power use as prices soar. ""Some companies 
are shutting down because it makes more sense to sell their gas (rather than 
using it as fuel to continue their manufacturing operations)."" 
That's not an option for the state's utility companies, which continue to 
report growing losses from buying electricity at higher costs than they can 
collect from their customers. They have covered the shortfall by borrowing 
money. 
Dow Jones Newswires reported that Pacific Gas & Electric was only ""weeks"" 
away from being unable to cover its power costs if prices continue at recent 
levels. 
A spokesman for the Bay Area utility's parent company declined to comment 
directly on the report. 
""It's up to the decision of creditors to make that call,"" said Greg Pruett, 
vice president of communications for PG&E. ""We have already borrowed $2.6 
billion to cover undercollections that have totaled $4.6 billion. 
""It can't continue forever."" 

Colombia's Medellin Utility Appeals Isagen Ruling, Paper Says
12/12/0 9:14 (New York)


     Bogota, Dec. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Colombia's largest municipal
utility, Empresas Publicas de Medellin, said it will appeal a high
court decision barring it from buying a majority stake in state-
run generator Isagen, the daily El Espectador reported.
     EPM general manager Ramiro Valencia said government plans to
sell its 76 percent stake in Isagen could not go ahead until the
appeal and other lawsuits filed by EPM are resolved, the report
said. Colombia in September suspended the Isagen sale, which it
hoped would raise $340 million, pending a Council of State ruling
on an EPM suit filed alleging bias in the sales process.
     The Council of State, which oversees state agencies, ruled
Friday that the energy regulator was in its rights when it ruled
earlier this year against any single company taking a majority
stake in Isagen to avoid market dominance.
     EPM is planning to purchase the government's 76 percent stake
in Isagen together with Enron Corp. of the U.S. to avoid the anti-
monopoly regulations.

1975,"Can we get any traction in supporting this?  The premise is obviously 
preaching to the choir, and we (as I am sure others do as well) have a string 
of proposals starting with SDGEs in May or June that, if we melded their 
timing and their prices into the attached timeline would be very damaging to 
thinking people.  However, are people really thinking, or has Davis and the 
reporters tainted the waters too badly?  What would be the result that we 
would like to get from such an exposee?  Do we really think that we could get 
some sympathy for returning to a market based structure?  Or, would we be 
like the irritating kid who keeps saying ""I told you so"", so it does not 
matter if he was right or not?  Are there any legal issues in revealing the 
prices?  Does doing this through IEP help?  (Note that the addition of prices 
could not be done, I do not think,  without naming companies, so we would be 
there, partially revealed.)

My vote:  if it does not hurt us (competitively, PR, etc.), if it is legal, 
and especially if it can help make even a small amout of progress towards a 
market based structure, I would do it.  Of course, we could not go anymore to 
restaurants near the CPUC......

I am out of town for the rest of the week, so I will leave the decision to 
you guys.  Whatever you decide, is OK.

PS - At the very least, we should feed our own proposals and their prices 
into this timeline.  Privately, we could show it to various parties on a case 
by case basis to advance our cause.  Just think about it...  what if SDGE had 
accepted our (and others) May/June proposals for 5.5 cents.....?)

California Stiffs Gore's Hatchet Men  

California's state controller, Democrat Kathleen Connell,  says she won't 
sign any checks for those $30,000-a-month Gore hatchet men hired  by bumbling 
Gov. Gray Davis to try to blame others for the state's energy  fiasco.  

""I would like assurance that their work is directly related to solving  
California's energy crisis and not the political strategy that [Mark] 
Fabiani  and [Chris] Lehane have built a reputation for through their work at 
the White  House,"" Connell said, Fox News reported today.  

Connell says she supports a lawsuit filed Monday in Sacramento by Lewis  
Uhler, president of National Tax Limitation Committee, to block ""consultant""  
fees to the two former advisers to failed presidential candidate Al Gore.  

""They have a conflict of interest that may be terminal to their employment,""  
Uhler said. ""These are clearly not electricity experts. Their background  
suggests they have been hired to be damage control folks for a beleaguered  
governor."""

Energy Department Study Warns
Price Controls Will Cause
California Blackouts to Worsen



(WASHINGTON, DC) -- The Department of Energy released a report today that
indicates that proposed wholesale electricity price controls in California
could double the number of rolling blackouts from 113 to 235 hours and
increase the number of households in the dark to about 1.575 million.

The report, The Impact of Wholesale Electricity Price Controls on California
Summer Reliability, was prepared by the Department's Office of Policy at the
request of U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska).  It evaluates the
probable effect of two alternative price cap proposals and concludes that
they ""are likely to increase the number of hours and the magnitude of the
outages that California will experience.""

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said the study confirms the federal
government's concern regarding price controls.  ""The findings of this report
are a clear warning that price controls will not help, but only hurt the
situation in California,"" Secretary Abraham said.  ""Minimizing the number of
blackouts ought to be our principal goal because more intense blackouts
would greatly imperil the health and safety of California's citizens and
would undermine the state's economy at least as much as high prices. Our
analysis is that blackouts will be worse and last longer if price controls
are established.""

The two proposals analyzed by the Energy Department are the $150 Hard Cap
and the Cost-Plus-$25 Price Cap advocated by California Governor Gray Davis
and some Western lawmakers.  The report concludes a $150 Hard Cap ""could
force as much as 3,600 megawatts of generating capacity in the State to shut
down.""  Likewise, a Cost-Plus-$25 price cap results in the delay or
abandonment of about 1,300 megawatts of capacity scheduled to be constructed
in the state.

""The problem with many of the price control proposals made so far is that
they either make it uneconomic for some of the highest cost plants to
operate, or they provide a strong disincentive for adding the type of
peaking capacity California hopes to bring on line this summer through their
expedited siting process,"" Secretary Abraham said.  ""This report confirms
the President's statement made in California that 'Price caps do nothing to
reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply.""

The report also concludes that the price control proposals it analyzed
""could significantly increase blackouts this summer, threatening public
health and safety.""  Both proposals directly translate into additional hours
of outages and households affected.  The analysis of the $150 Hard Cap
proposal concludes that the number of hours of blackouts is projected to
more than double to about 235 hours, with the average outage size increasing
about 230 megawatts.  Approximately 175,000 additional households would be
affected.  Similarly, the report projects that the Cost-Plus-$25 Price Cap
proposal will increase the number of hours of expected outages by about 25
percent this summer, with the average outage size increasing about 120
megawatts.  Approximately 90,000 additional households could be affected.

Under current conditions the department expects that California will
experience between 113 hours of rolling blackouts this summer with an
average outage size of about 1,900 megawatts, effecting roughly 1.4
households.  One megawatt is roughly enough energy to power 750 households.

1999,"Christi,
 As I have been thinking about this problem, my opposition to a standard 
model is declining, partly out of frustration with the slow progress being 
made.  I think, however, that we ought to think about the potential 
consequences of recommending a standard model.  If we simply endorse PJM, 
then we may inadvertently get its warts as well -- no secondary transmission 
market, ICAP market, etc.  I think we are considering the same thing approach 
as was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO 
Coordination (Seams) Conference:

""Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard 
tariff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing 
different proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single 
market model.""

 In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for either 
filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a ""feet to the 
fire"" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for a 
standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we should 
specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission rights 
issue, for instance, a simple ""don't allocate"" solution won't work.  The lack 
of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the lack of 
information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed 
suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be 
pressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power.  

 It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tariff 
without a rulemaking proceeding.  Whether they could act by fiat or not is a 
moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a record.  
There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome of a 
rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a pretty good 
record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of goodies such 
as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a distinct 
risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is given 
blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge uphill 
battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on current  
RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rulemaking 
creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule cuts off 
options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior to the 
issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On the other 
hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued.  This 
also happened prior to Order No. 888, with a number of companies sitting on 
their hands, using the time delay to protect existing positions, while 
whipping up State regulators' fears of jurisdictional shift as necessary to 
boost their own position.

 These are only own views.  I have not had a chance to speak with West Power 
this week, but I will approach Tim when I am in Portland again next week.

Steve

2007,"Power Situation by State

By The Associated Press

    A state-by-state look at the electric power situation for
summer:


Alabama: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely as
utilities are required to maintain a reserve 15 percent above what
is needed to meet peak demand. Residential and business customers
will pay rates about 1.1 percent above a year ago.


Alaska: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely. Hydroelectric
power is plentiful, and generating systems are not being taxed.
Electric bills are expected to fall slightly.


Arizona: There is little likelihood of a power interruption.
Utilities are prepared to handle the summer electricity demand, and
price caps prevent the major utilities from increasing rates.


Arkansas: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are highly unlikely.
Electric bills are expected to rise 5 percent as increased fuel
costs are passed on to customers and because the summer is expected
to be even hotter than a year ago, when readings topped out at 111
degrees in Little Rock.


California: Forecasts of tight power supplies throughout the
West have energy experts in California warning of statewide rolling
blackouts this summer. Power grid managers say concerted
conservation efforts, accelerated construction of new power plants
and ``a bit of luck'' could help avoid blackouts. Grid managers
have already ordered rotating blackouts on four days since January.
Los Angeles will most likely be spared because the L.A. Department
of Water and Power provides its own generation and isn't connected
with the state's grid.


Colorado: The state is unlikely to experience blackouts or
brownouts as 93 percent of its power comes from coal-fired plants.
Because of fixed, long-term contracts for coal, producers do not
anticipate any fuel cost adjustments.


Connecticut: No brownouts or blackouts are anticipated.
Brownouts are possible, though, if there is a prolonged spike in
usage while power plants are down. Utilities are under a mandatory
price rate cap.


Delaware: Enough power is available to avoid blackouts or
brownouts, but questions linger about whether utilities can deliver
it. Power is undergoing deregulation in Delaware and officials are
concerned over the possibility of increased costs. However, under a
1998 deregulation law, the cost of electricity is temporarily
capped.


Florida: Power outages are unlikely this summer as the state has
reserves of about 20 percent. Utility companies have already
increased their rates to cover higher fuel costs. Unless coal and
oil wholesale prices increase sharply, consumers should not expect
major rate increases.


Georgia: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely in the state
because a for-profit regulatory system gives suppliers an incentive
to build more generating plants. Rising costs for natural gas,
which fuels almost all new electric plants, could increase
residential electric bills by 25 percent.


Hawaii: There is little likelihood of blackouts, rolling
brownouts or price spikes. As an island state, Hawaii's electricity
system is not connected with that of other states. Each island has
its own generation system and supply is sufficient to meet demand.


Idaho: There is little chance of blackouts or rolling brownouts
but bills are rising. The state's largest utility wants a 34
percent increase in residential rates.


Illinois: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unexpected as
generating has been increased with a number of small ``peaker''
plants. Homeowners shouldn't see a rate increase, either;
electricity rates are locked in through 2004 under the state's
deregulation plan.


Indiana: There is no expectation of blackouts or brownouts
unless there are weeks of very hot weather or a power plant stops
operating. Utility companies are urging consumers to conserve
energy and believe that will maintain the remaining state energy
surpluses, which have decreased from 30 percent to 10 percent over
the past decade.


Iowa: While the state does not expect blackouts this summer,
problems could occur as early as 2002 with serious capacity
problems by 2006. Only single-digit price increases are expected
this summer.


Kansas: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are unlikely. Kansas has
never had a regional transmission blackout. The size of electric
bills will depend on how hot it gets and how much power customers
use for air conditioning. State law prohibits price spikes by
regulated utilities, which supply 70 percent of residential
customers.


Kentucky: Electricity rates in the state are among the lowest in
the nation, but will likely rise between 3.2 percent and 3.8
percent by 2003, largely due to pollution control equipment
upgrades. There is adequate supply to avoid brownouts and blackouts
this summer.


Louisiana: No blackouts are expected this summer but utility
officials say the state is on the verge of a power crisis unless
more plants are built. Consumer advocates say bills are likely to
increase by as much as 30 percent with very high natural gas prices
and a hot summer in the forecast.


Maine: Five new natural gas-fired power plants are on line or
coming on line soon, reducing the prospect of any rolling
blackouts. No consumer rate increases are expected.


Maryland: The Public Service Commission does not expect any
service interruptions and believes electricity rates will not rise.
An electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced, and
then froze, rates for homes and businesses.


Massachusetts: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely because New
England has added a half dozen new power plants in the past 18
months _ enough supply to outpace demand surges. Residents will
likely see hefty rate hikes in the winter, including as much as 42
percent for some consumers.


Michigan: Under a state law signed last year that will
deregulate the electricity industry in 2002, utilities cut rates by
5 percent and must cap those rates for five years. Although demand
for electricity is growing between 2 percent and 3 percent
annually, utilities say they have enough supply to meet demand.


Minnesota: No blackouts or rolling brownouts are likely unless
there is an extended heat wave or a power plant failure.
Electricity costs are expected to remain steady. Many customers,
however, will spend the summer months paying off natural gas and
electricity bills from the long, cold winter.


Mississippi: Blackouts this summer are unlikely. The two main
power suppliers are taking measures to boost their reserves during
peak summer months and new independent generating plants also are
available. Mississippi Power expects bills for customers to be 3
percent to 6 percent higher this summer. Entergy, another supplier,
has not filed its summer rate plan yet.


Missouri: Utilities have plenty of generating capacity and
supply contracts, so service interruptions aren't expected. The
state Public Service Commission says three large utilities are
bringing new or expanded generating plants on line. State law bars
rate spikes by PSC-regulated utilities, so customer bills shouldn't
reflect higher generating costs.


Montana: Blackouts and rolling brownouts are not expected.
Montana Power customers will not see price increases this summer
because the company is under a virtual rate freeze until July 2002.
Flathead Electric's rates rose 29 percent on April 1 and an
additional 60 percent increase is possible this fall. The two
companies serve more than half of the customers in Montana.


Nebraska: No rolling blackouts are expected. Electric bills are
not expected to increase since the state's largest utility already
increased its rates by 2 percent to 4 percent.


Nevada: Major utilities are not expecting blackouts or rolling
brownouts, but monthly electricity bills for two power companies
will go up 1 percent to 2 percent a month through September, based
on already-authorized incremental rate increases. State lawmakers,
reacting to California's energy crisis, are processing measures
that would block deregulation from taking effect. Gov. Kenny Guinn
also has said he will not let deregulation take effect under 1997
and 1999 laws unless he's confident consumers won't be harmed.


New Hampshire: Blackouts are unlikely but customers may have to
conserve power on very hot days. As part of deregulation, rates
will drop about 12 percent for customers of the state's largest
electric utility. But rates could rise 20 percent to 30 percent for
customers of the second-largest utility.


New Jersey: Blackouts are unlikely because of protections
included in a 2-year-old energy deregulation law. Rates are capped
until 2003. However, regulators allowed utilities to raise natural
gas rates over the summer, 2 percent a month through July, to make
up for money lost over the winter to skyrocketing fuel prices.


New Mexico: Most of the state will escape power outages and rate
increases during the summer months.


New York: To head off potential power shortfalls in New York
City, the New York Power Authority is rushing to finish
construction of 11 small natural gas turbines. Upstate New York's
largest utility says it has enough power to avoid blackouts and
brownouts during the summer. Rates are regulated across much of the
state, but in New York City customers pay market prices.


North Carolina: No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected.
No major rate cases are pending in the state among the large,
regulated utilities.


North Dakota: The state exports about 70 percent of the
electricity produced from seven coal-fired power plants and is
facing no power shortages this summer. Electricity bills to power
air conditioners are not expected to double from the previous
summer the way natural gas bills doubled in the winter.


Ohio: No blackouts or rolling brownouts are expected unless
there is a long heat wave. Prices for residential customers will
remain flat for the next five years as part of a deregulation plan
that took effect Jan. 1.


Oklahoma: There is little likelihood of blackouts or rolling
brownouts between May and September, but Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric,
which has 700,000 customers in the state and northwestern Arkansas,
expects electricity bills to be 10 percent to 15 percent above last
summer.


Oregon: Some extraordinary measures may be needed to ensure
there are no rolling blackouts or brownouts this summer. The
measures could include curtailing hydroelectric programs that help
salmon. Price spikes could occur.


Pennsylvania: No blackouts or brownouts are expected. The state
is a net exporter of power and has more than enough supply to meet
demand. Electricity bills will not rise this summer because power
companies agreed to cap their rates, in come cases through 2010.


Rhode Island: Blackouts are unlikely, partly because of power
plants built in New England in recent years. Businesses could see
electric rates rise as much as 46 percent.


South Carolina: With reserves of about 15 percent, there is very
little chance of power interruption in the state. Two major
utilities have obtained rate increases of about 3 percent to
reflect higher fuel costs. Increased demand from summer air
conditioning normally pushes summer bills up 50 percent by July.


South Dakota: The majority of power comes from dams or
coal-fired generating plants rather than natural gas. There is
little chance of power shortages this summer and rates should
remain stable.


Tennessee: Tennessee Valley Authority electric rates were last
raised in 1997 and should remain steady through the summer. No
blackouts or brownouts are expected.


Texas: Additional transmission lines should reduce the
likelihood of blackouts or rolling brownouts. Certain fuel
surcharges related to natural gas prices may cause higher
electricity bills.


Utah: Officials are counting on Californians to cut their energy
use and free more power for use on the Western electricity grid to
avoid blackouts or brownouts. Utah power has received a 9.4 percent
interim rate increase and has 19 percent rate increase awaiting
approval.


Vermont: Chances of blackouts or brownouts are low. Much of
Vermont's electricity is imported from Quebec, though the state is
also dependent on the regional power grid that serves New England.
Electric rates are regulated.


Virginia: Blackouts and brownouts are highly unlikely because of
an increase in the generating capacity of the state's largest
utility. The size of electric bills will be determined by the
weather and consumption, not any change in rates, which are capped
through 2007.


Washington: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely, although
utilities will have a razor-thin power margin that would not
withstand the loss of a power plant or transmission line.
Electricity largely comes from dams, and a severe drought is
reducing the water supply and raising prices. Industrial and
residential customers of public utility districts have already seen
rate increases. Rates could rise 10 percent to 20 percent this
year.


West Virginia: Generating capacity is sufficient to meet peak
air conditioning needs. None of the four major utilities has
requested a rate increase.


Wisconsin: Electric bills could run as much as 10 percent higher
this summer because of surcharges to cover rising prices for
natural gas, which fuels many plants. State officials ordered
utilities in December to increase their reserves from 15 percent to
18 percent to bolster reliability during the summer.


Wyoming: Blackouts and brownouts are unlikely but could occur
because the state grid is intertwined with other systems that could
experience shortages. Xcel Energy, serving Cheyenne, has applied
for a 57 percent price increase. Similar filings are expected from
other suppliers."

Enron Turns Internal Credit-Risk Tool Into New Product
By Christina Cheddar

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  (This report was originally published late Wednesday.)

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--With the number of corporate bankruptcies on the rise,
knowing the creditworthiness of one's customers is becoming more and more
important.
For Enron Corp. (ENE), the world's largest energy trading company, keeping
track of credit risk has always been part of doing business. That became
even more true with the company's launch of EnronOnline, its Internet-based
commodities trading network.
In order to deal with the accelerated volume and speed of transactions on
EnronOnline, the company developed a tool to help its own commercial traders
manage the credit risk.
Early last year, Enron rolled out this tool, Enron Credit, on a limited
basis. Gradually, the company expanded its use and scope. Last month, the
company re-launched Enron Credit in its current format.
Enron Credit tracks more than 10,000 companies, giving each a rating known
as the ""Enron cost of credit ."" The rating is expressed as an interest rate.

The Web site also provides news, a company's expected chance of bankruptcy
and other related information.
While much of this information is free to registered users, Enron also has
turned the product into a new revenue stream.
Users may download data into a spreadsheet and receive periodic updates for
a fee.
The site also can sell a user a ""digital bankruptcy swap,"" which is a way to
hedge against credit exposure.
The price of the swap is determined by a rating Enron's staff assigns to a
company and the amount of credit exposure a company needs to protect
against.
For a supplier, the main advantage of a swap is that if a customer is unable
to pay due to bankruptcy, the supplier will be paid immediately.
According to Enron Europe President John Sherriff, the goal of Enron Credit
is to create a more efficient credit market by increasing trading liquidity.

The tool is important because ""in just a short amount of time, a company's
credit can go from stellar to bad literally overnight.""
At present, some analysts haven't factored in revenue from Enron Credit into
their earnings models. However, as the commodity markets Enron trades in
mature, it is possible the need for products such as Enron Credit could
increase.

2011,"Energy Cost Study Critical of Public Agencies Too 
 Power: DWP is among three government-run producers cited as driving prices 
up. Spokesmen deny any market manipulation. 

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers

????Government-owned utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power, were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels 
that helped ignite California's exploding energy crisis during the summer and 
fall, according to public and confidential records. 
?????For months, Gov. Gray Davis, legislators and consumer advocates have 
chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into 
darkness and economic chaos. 
?????But they are just part of the equation. 
?????A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that 
have allegedly manipulated the electricity market. While the document does 
identify out-of-state merchants criticized for gouging, it also discloses for 
the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized 
profits in the volatile spot market. 
?????The document--which decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a 
recent state study--singles out three government-run agencies as consistently 
trying to inflate prices. They are: the DWP, the federally owned Bonneville 
Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canada's 
BC Hydro in British Columbia. 
?????Like a number of privately owned generators, these three producers 
offered power at a range of high prices and, sometimes, in large amounts when 
the state was most desperate. They also helped saddle California's three 
largest utilities with billions of dollars in debt--leading one, Pacific Gas 
& Electric, to seek bankruptcy protection last week. 
?????The study by the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO, 
analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large suppliers in 
the spot, or ""real-time,"" market from May to November. The study accounted 
for factors such as rising production costs, increased demand, periods of 
scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy, competitive market. 
?????Money earned above that was called excess profits. 
?????No entity--public or private--earned as much in alleged excess profits 
as British Columbia's Powerex, the state records show. 
?????""They were the most aggressive bidders,"" said Anjali Sheffrin, author of 
the coded study. 
?????""They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in,"" 
said Sheffrin, who did not discuss any companies by name. 
?????The Canadian agency reaped $176 million in alleged excessive 
profits--several times the amount collected by all but one of the private 
generators. Second on the list was Atlanta-based Southern Co. Energy 
Marketing, now called Mirant, which collected nearly $97 million in alleged 
inflated earnings. 
?????BC Hydro and Mirant--along with the DWP and other producers--say they 
played by the rules established under California's flawed deregulation plan 
and did not exploit the state's troubles. 
?????But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of 
severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise 
overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity, which could be 
produced inexpensively but sold for a premium. 
?????""It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity 
would be at any given time,"" said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins. ""We 
helped keep the lights on in California."" 
?????And the rates low for their own customers. During the past year, BC 
Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a ""rainy day"" account to 
ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America. 
?????Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power, although eighth on the list 
of alleged profiteers, was among those singled out for seeking high prices 
during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire 
spot market, where emergency purchases are made. 
?????This, according to state documents, was accomplished by offering power 
at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest 
increases in demand. The strategy also helped prop up prices, keeping them 
from falling. 
?????The DWP's average hourly bid, or asking price, for electricity 
ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston 
and Tulsa-based Williams Cos., two major players in the national energy 
market. 
?????In addition, the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that 
could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand, the report said, 
referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers. ""The data shows they 
clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load 
conditions."" 
?????DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the report's findings 
""outrageous,"" insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices. 
?????""These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes 
unpunished in this state,"" Freeman said, noting that DWP power helped avert 
more blackouts across the state. 
?????He did acknowledge, however, that the agency has charged high prices for 
surplus power at the 11th hour but said that was only because it cost more to 
produce. 
?????""We have consistently charged [Cal-ISO] our cost, plus 15%,"" he said. 
""It's not as though we're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down 
their throats."" 
?????Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report, they never 
took it personally. ""If you're innocent,"" he said, ""you don't look at the 
criminal file."" 
?????Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in California's 
deregulated market was the U.S. government's Bonneville Power Administration, 
a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal 
dams in the Columbia-Snake River basin. 
?????Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP, records show, but 
reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it 
supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied. Bonneville was 
in the top five accused of taking excessive profits. 
?????Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back 
federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon 
recovery program. 
?????Stephen Oliver, a Bonneville vice president, said his agency did not act 
improperly and has asked Cal-ISO for detailed information on how it reached 
its conclusions. He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading 
for last-minute electricity and offering to pay high prices. 
?????""From our point of view, we bid what we had when we had it and we 
operated precisely within the terms of their rules,"" Oliver said. 
?????Those rules--and the bidding practices criticized by Cal-ISO--so 
distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp. of Missouri, which tried to act 
responsibly, has bailed out. 
?????It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier 
studied--slightly more than $8 per megawatt-hour, compared to Mirant's $138, 
the highest. 
?????But the spot market, as initially designed, made sure that all suppliers 
offering power received the highest price paid in any hour. 
?????The result: Aquila collected $171 an hour for power it was willing to 
sell at a single-digit price. 
?????""They weren't the culprits,"" said Cal-ISO's Sheffrin. ""Someone else 
drove that up."" 
?????Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California 
market because it was too unpredictable. Although the company made money, he 
said, it also could have lost because of possible downward swings. 
?????""We looked at it and we didn't feel very comfortable with what we saw,"" 
he said. 
?????The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the 
price for everyone. But Sheffrin said it hasn't made much difference because 
the overall prices are still excessive. 
?????""We're saying the patient is sick,"" Sheffrin said of California's 
electricity market. ""It needs help [and] may die.""

2013,"What do you think?
"
2014,"Presented below is a synopsis of the 6.75 hour phone call yesterday.   The 
primary short-term issue facing us is whether we wish to throw our name in to 
be co-chair.    The only other marketer on the official committee is Dynegy, 
Reliant is not on the committee but sat in.    The group generally agreed 
that the co-chairs should be a financial player (bank, bond or CP) and an 
energy company (QF or marketer).   After the phone call, I spoke with 
Dynegy's general counsel John Herbert, who is their designated 
representative.  He was going to check within his organization whether there 
was appetite to serve today, but was not all that inclined, given his ""day 
job"" as he put it.   I think we would agree that a marketer should be the 
other co-chair as the QF's have a narrow agenda.  Here are some of the 
plusses and minuses if we threw our name in:

+ Better access to information and guiding consensus
+ Ability to explain the necessity of long term contracts in the solution
- time commitment
- will we be more of a lightning rod?

2023,"Dan Watkiss argues that FERC has no authority to override the state, even 
though the rules go far beyond what is critical or necessary. 

Per Christi's thoughts, we may want to gauge Congressional interest in 
pushing something as an add-on to EPAct '92 that allows only safety / public 
interest reasons for an EWG to be restricted in its siting by a State.

2029,"Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Jeff

"
2031,"The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission 
meeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence 
gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will 
require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  
All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, 
will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of 
their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric 
facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) 

Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price 
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the 
ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a 
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power 
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission 
rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be 
the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; 
emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and 
emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day.  A 
single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators.  
Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with 
FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each 
generating unit.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost 
for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event 
a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, 
within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO 
justifying its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs 
in real time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to 
justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with 
no opportunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.

Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities 
must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be 
curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.  
(24-7)  

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced 
outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC. 

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 
or Order lapses with no further effect.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how 
things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are due 
in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate 
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold 
of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate bidding 
behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the 
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit 
behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be 
inappropriate.  In addition, ""hockey stick"" bids are expressly prohibited 
(i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).

Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  
Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a 
control area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when 
this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be 
justified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell 
contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within 
WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  
Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective 
date is 60 days from publication of the Order.

Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is 
prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines 
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part 
of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation 
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.  

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether 
FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow 
account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the 
PG&E bankruptcy filing.  

No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from 
California.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of 
the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will 
keep you posted.

DISTRIBUTION: Business Editors/Energy Writers 

LENGTH: 821 words 

HEADLINE: SDG&E Seeks $16 Million for Energy-Efficiency Assistance for 
Customers 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, July 24, 2000 

BODY: 
 
To provide its customers with additional assistance this summer and next, San 
Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) has requested from the California Public 
Utilities Commission (CPUC) $16 million over the next two years to increase 
funding for energy-efficiency programs.
""Our customers need assistance today in lowering their energy costs and 
today's proposal will bring an additional $16 million funding to encourage 
energy conservation in our region,"" said Edwin A. Guiles, president of SDG&E. 
""This money can be used to help replace old, inefficient appliances, such as 
air conditioners and refrigerators, which will result in reduced electric 
bills and less strain on our state's electric-supply system.""
Of the $16 million, SDG&E would allocate an additional $4.3 million 
exclusively for low-income energy-efficiency assistance programs over the 
next two years.  
Under the proposal filed Friday, the low-income assistance funds will be used 
to expand existing programs, such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler 
replacements, while introducing new programs, including room air-conditioner 
replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair. The program also 
includes incentives for landlords to replace refrigerators and air 
conditioners in rental units.
The rest of the money would go into other energy-efficiency programs to 
provide incentives for removal and recycling of operating second 
refrigerators; refrigerator and room air-conditioner replacement; replacement 
of inefficient pool pumps; and increased incentives for a variety of programs 
to benefit small businesses.
Funds for these additional incentives come from 1999 programs that did not 
draw as much customer participation as expected. For instance, large 
customers requested less than half the amount budgeted for a program designed 
to provide energy-efficiency incentives to them.
Details on the programs are still being developed, but they should be in 
place in early September. The CPUC is expected to act on SDG&E's filing in 
late August.
In California's newly created competitive energy marketplace, SDG&E is a 
delivery-service provider. For those customers who have not chosen another 
energy service provider, SDG&E buys electricity from the California Power 
Exchange (Cal-PX) and passes that cost directly onto its customers, with no 
mark-up. The price of power is now a function of supply and demand in the 
open market. Over the last several weeks, SDG&E customers have seen their 
electric bills rise sharply due to the significant increase in commodity 
costs as a result of power demand in California and surrounding states.
Friday's proposal marks the latest in a series of actions SDG&E has taken 
recently to help customers grapple with high electric prices.
On July 20, SDG&E and the Cal-PX proposed a new market-based power bidding 
solution to the CPUC that would allow SDG&E to procure power for customers 
with less price volatility over the next five to nine months.
On July 14, SDG&E filed a request with the CPUC to accelerate the return of 
$100 million in customer money from a CPUC-controlled account. The CPUC's 
approval of SDG&E's request would release of money acquired from 
power-generating benefits of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and other 
assets would decrease the August and September residential electric bills by 
$34, or $17 a month.
That proposal, combined with the deregulation-dividend checks most SDG&E 
customers will receive next month, will result in a total of about $500 
million benefit to them in August and September -- nearly$300 for the typical 
residential customer -- helping to ease cash-flow problems from higher 
electricity prices.
The company is actively promoting a level-pay program to all customers, which 
enables them to even out their bill payments over the course of the year, so 
they can manage better against their monthly household budget. Those 
customers participating in the plan will see bills this summer that are 
comparable to last summer's bills.
SDG&E also has increased communications to both residential and business 
customers regarding the changes in the energy marketplace, available 
energy-efficiency funding and conservation tips for reducing electric bills.
Information about these programs is available by calling 1-800-411-SDGE.
San Diego Gas & Electric is a public utility that provides service to 3 
million consumers through 1.2 million electric meters and 740,000 natural gas 
meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties. SDG&E is a subsidiary of 
Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE), a Fortune 500 energy services holding company based 
in San Diego, with 12,000 employees, revenues of nearly $5.5 billion and more 
than 9 million customers in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico and 
South America.

2054,"ABX 128 (Corbett), which is the Assembly equivalent to SBX 1, will be
heard by the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee on Monday.  The
bill will be substantially rewritten in committee.  According to
Assembly Member Corbett's office, the bill will have some similarities
with SBX 1, presumably the revenue neutral aspect, but will go in a
substantially different direction.  The Committee will not even release
the language to the Senate Committee so its contents are a closely
guarded secret."

Basics of Proposal
Something akin to the MOU (that adequately addresses the solvency issue, for 
the IOUs, the State and QFs), but WITHOUT the transmission component
Direct Access for ALL customers, transitioning to a core/noncore market 
structure in 18-24 months (this can be accomplished without stranding CDWR's 
contracts)
Concessions
 -IOUs (MOU modifications)
 -Generators (past due amounts)
 -investigations
Package to finance the deal (bond issuance backed by rate increases to permit 
securitization)

Message
This is the last best chance to achieve a comprehensive settlement
We have developed a comprehensive solution and are meeting with everyone that 
will see us.
We have thus far received positive feedback on and a willingness to work with 
our proposal
We intend to work tirelelessly to gain support for a total solution"

10-15 power point slides) for Ken to use during the meeting.  

What do you think about sending the information Jeff prepared for McNealy to 
the CEOs in advance of the meeting so that they have something to think about 
before they arrive for the discussion?  

Ken needs to meet with the UC Chancellor while he's in LA (probably around 
lunchtime), but are there any other meetings you think he should have while 
he's in California?

"
2066,"""Plan B""
As folks know, there's a group of moderate Democrats in the CA Assembly that 
has been working on a ""Plan B.""
They've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the Governor's 
MOU with Edison.
The Plan B group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders, including 
Republicans, to get input into how ""Plan B"" can improve upon the MOU.
First the good news about Plan B:  a fairly bright group of legislators is 
rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to 
the problem, and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be 
bi-partison about it.  (There is at least one idea in Plan B that is 
attributable to a Republican--Keith Richman--that Ken Lay met with a couple 
of weeks ago.) So the beginnings of a process to resolve California's crisis 
may be emerging.
Now the bad news:  because they are trying to build a consensus, Plan B is a 
mish-mash, isn't focused, includes some pretty bad ideas, excludes some good 
ideas (like re-establishing Direct Access immediately), and is going to 
require a lot more work to get right.
Update on Efforts to Achieve a Settlement
In the meeting with the suppliers that Steve Kean and I participated in 
yesterday, one of the financial consultants hired by the Governor criticized 
several of the Plan B proposals as unworkable.
On today's call with the Governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat 
apparent that the Governor isn't going drive a resolution, but will leave it 
to the Legislature to take the lead role.
The staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits, investigations, etc. were 
not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks, and that 
attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter.
Instead, the Governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of 
the discount that suppliers would be willing to take.
The suppliers pushed back, stating that including haircuts in the talks while 
excluding the lawsuits, investigations, etc. is one-sided and unworkable.
The staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the Legislature, but 
made it fairly clear that the Governor would not be the one to pull the 
necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution; his staff 
implied instead that it's up to others, i.e., the suppliers, to get the 
process of negotiations underway.
Next Steps
If the Governor's financial consultants are prepared by Friday, they will 
brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to 
resolve the State's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power 
deals with CDWR.  It they are not ready by Friday, the suppliers will meet 
separately to discuss next steps.
Finally, there's been some confusion.  My apologies.  
Sandi faxed to Jim and Harry yesterday a copy of ""Plan B.""  Sandi mentioned 
that the Governor gave the Plan B group an analysis of the Plan.  For those 
that have a copy of Plan B, see the 10-page memo dated May 12th, attached to 
the back of the Plan.  The memo is from Joe Fichera to John Dutra, Fred 
Keeley and Joe Nation (3 of the Plan B Democratic legislators).  Joe Fichera 
is the head of Saber Partners, a financial consulting group that the Governor 
hired to advise him on the crisis.  
If anyone has not yet received a copy of Plan B, please let me know and I'll 
get it to you.

Jeff"

2069,"All:

Attached is the latest version.    Note the average price of power
assumed purchased by the DWR, if smoothed to a fixed price equivalent
for the 9.5 years beginning 7/1/01, is $106/mwh and $104/mwh if DWR's
forward price curves are used.  We used a range of $82.75 to $104/mwh in
our sensitivity page.   The $82.75 is the mid-point between Henwood and
DWR curves.   Enron's curves are significantly lower on the back-end.
The other switch is for the allocation of the past utility purchases: 1)
one pro rata, and 2)  one where the non-core shares prorata, plus half
the core's portion.  DWR past purchases are handled pro rata in both
scenarios.

2076,"The following notes are from Ken Smith from State Controller Kathleen
Connell's press conference today:

California State Controller Kathleen Connell held a press conference
today.  Although the Dow Newswire said it would be to disclose long-term
contracts, the event focused on what she believes will be an additional
need for borrowing beyond the energy bonds.

She anticipates an additional $4 billion in borrowing will be needed in
February to meet expected costs.  The borrowing should, she said, be
done as Revenue Anticipation Notes (RANs), short-term notes at a lower
interest rates (about 4%) that must be paid back by the end of the year,
rather than as additional energy bonds.  She categorized the current
budget situation as =01&the same kind of environment as a bad budget year,=
=018
and said California should maintain at least a 3% reserve.

She did not comment on individual contracts except to say there are 17
different contracts.

Charts her office had prepared showed that $5.136 billion had been spent
on energy purchases through 5/17/01; about 99% of that went to spot
market purchases.  There was also a chart that showed projected
expenditures under the Governor=01,s plan to be $8.349 billion for the
period January 1-June 1, 2001, with about 89% of that going to spot
market purchases.  How these numbers work together was confusing =01) I
checked with a reporter, who said he was also unclear.  I=01,ll try to get
this cleared up this afternoon.

An easel held a large photocopy of a $533 million check to Mirant, which
is the largest energy check written to date.   More has been paid to
Reliant =01) she put it at about 25% of total expenditures =01) but =01&we =
have
never written a check to Reliant over $500 million=018 because of the way
they invoice.

She said the Governor=01,s financial assumptions for power =01&do not fit i=
nto
the most likely scenario=018 and that summer conditions will greatly affect
the actual spending needs.  She noted that DWR estimates it will spend
$9.2 billion through June 30, 2002, although the PUC has only authorized
$7.5 billion.

The other significant announcement was that she plans to use her
authority with the Board of Equalization to hold hearings to determine
whether power plants sold by utilities have been properly assessed for
property taxes.  Apparently, they are still on the tax rolls at previous
rates, but she believes the profits recorded by some generators means
the plants may be more valuable than their current assessments.

A press release was not distributed at the event, although there may be
one issued later today.

"
2081,"This afternoon the Commission has issued an Order Requesting Comments in the 
SDG&E and LA Dept. of Water & Power petition proceedings on the short term 
capacity release price cap (RP01-180, RP01-222).

The order requests comments on ""whether...[to] reimpose the maximum rate 
ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions into California and the 
effects of such action on the California gas market.""  Order and attachment 
are attached at the bottom of this email.  Print to read all footnotes 
(original came in WordPerfect).

Note that in footnote 2, the order explains the current comprehensive 
Commission approach to the gas market in California, and that they're 
reaching out for the gray market:  ""On May 18, 2001, in Docket No. 
RM01-9-000, the Commission issued an order proposing to impose certain 
reporting requirements on natural gas sellers and transporters serving the 
California market.  The proposed reporting requirements are intended to 
provide the Commission with the necessary information to determine what 
action, if any, it should take within its jurisdiction.  Our order today 
coupled with our May 18 order continues to focus on issues related to natural 
gas prices in California and actions we may take to address capacity release 
transactions and bundled sales (i.e., the ""gray market"").""

To note in this order, the discussion includes an explanation that FERC 
Staff's analysis of capacity release data between Nov. 2000 and April 2001 
shows that only .09 to 1.2 percent of the volume of capacity releases into CA 
were above the maximum tariff rate.  In light of this information, the order 
requests comment on whether the price cap into California would be reimposed 
on short term releases prior to Sept. 30, 2002.

Comments are due in  20 days.  Questions asked in the order are:  (1) Would 
reimposition of the maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release 
transactions into California have any significant effect on the price of gas 
at the California border; (2) Should the reimposition of the maximum rate 
ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions be limited to California 
or extended to pipelines delivering into the Western Systems Coordinating 
Council (WSCC) region; (3) What effect do capacity release transactions have 
on wholesale electric prices; (4) What would be the effect of reimposing the 
maximum rate ceiling on short-term capacity release transactions into 
California given firm shippers' ability to make bundled sales at the 
California border; and (5) How will reimposing the maximum rate ceiling for 
short-term capacity release transactions into California impact shippers' 
ability to obtain short-term firm capacity.

An excel attachment to the order details the Staff findings on Transportation 
Release Transactions above the max. rate Nov. 2000 - April 2001

"
2089,"Dan Douglass summarized this.  This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that 
they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- FERC reiterates 
that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a 
cap on ISO purchases.  ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to 
file with FERC, wait 60 days and amend its contract
"
2090,"Executive Summary:

? Legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking 
for a realistic Plan B
? The Keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the 30% 
generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component
? Despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued 
oppostion from Burton and his consumer group allies, the Keeley plan will 
probably pass the legislature
? The generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees 
from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end
? PG&E could get the same offer as SoCal through the bankruptcy court.

1. Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators into a Deal

According to sources, the Assembly is ""terrified""  of the current holes in 
the budget due to buying power.  The impact of the  energy crisis is 
reportedly causing panic among some legislators.  This  panic appears to be 
moving a SoCal bailout plan forward.
 
 Sources report that a modified Plan B deal is  ""not that far off""; it will 
likely take one to two weeks (more likely closer to  two) to move a deal 
through the Assembly and the Senate and to the governor's  desk once it is 
introduced.
 
2. What Would the New Plan B Look Like?

- This modified Plan B deal, which  will originate in the Assembly, will 
almost certainly include a dedicated  rate component to pay SoCal's 
undercollect.  Revenue bonds will be issued  securitized by this dedicated 
rate component.  It is also very likely that  the generators would be offered 
70 cents on the dollar for what they are owed  immediately, with the 
possibility of more if they win litigation.  (Sources  report that the state 
is ""fairly confident"" that at least most generators  would not be successful 
in winning this additional money.)  Assembly Speaker Keeley  reportedly 
remains the driving force behind this plan, and it is being drawn up  from 
within his office.
 
3. Transmission Lines

- It remains unclear at this time whether a  transmission line purchase or 
option to purchase will be put into the deal,  since this is a major point of 
contention between the Democrats and  Republicans.  According to sources, the 
Assembly is ""working on  this.""

4. Plan Looks Good to Pass Both Assembly and Senate 

- According to sources, the vote count for passing  a deal containing the 
above components (except the transmission line purchase,  which is not yet 
settled) ""looks very good.""  The vote in the Senate would  be ""very close.""  
Senator Burton still opposes a bail-out deal, but he  reportedly might not 
stand in the way of others from voting for the  plan, making its passage more 
likely.  Even opponents of the plan  (including Burton and the consumer 
advocates) say that the odds of a modified  Plan B passing the Senate are 
better than 50-50.  These opponents are  reportedly ""pessimistic"" about their 
chances of stopping a Plan B from passing  at this point.

5. Caveat: Generators Are Waiting For Guarantees That the Witch Hunt Will End
 
- As reported previously, sources continue to  believe that generators would 
be reluctant to take a 70 cent-on-the-dollar  haircut without the state 
offering them relief from further prosecution.   (Without this relief, the 
state could give them 70 cents, then try to take away  even more.)  Sources 
report that even opponents of the plan accept that the  generators should be 
offered this relief from prosecution.  Thus, it  appears likely at this time 
that most generators would accept a 30 percent  haircut if they were paid 
immediately.  Also, sources believe that the  securitization on the dedicated 
rate component offered in the modified Plan B  would be sufficient to pay 
back those generators who successfully litigated to  win more than 70 cents 
on the dollar.
 
- Sources believe that SoCal Edison's creditors are  likely to forebear from 
filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this  plan to go through, 
since it would pay back most of what they are  owed.
 
6. PG & E Could Also Be Dealt In
 
- If this plan succeeds, it will almost certainly  be taken to the bankruptcy 
court and offered to PG&E as part of a  reorganization plan.  This plan can 
be offered at any time within  PG&E's ""period of exclusivity.""  This is a 
90-day period (though it is  often extended) following the filing of a 
bankruptcy petition.
 
- However, sources report that the state is  concerned about how to approach 
the bankruptcy court.  Based on Supreme  Court precedent (which legal sources 
within the state have been reviewing), the  state would likely lose its 
sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the  bankrutpcy court.  This 
is a problem because the stakes in this case are so  high.
 
7. Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation For A New Rate Structure

- Even if the state passes and signs a SoCal  bailout, it would still need to 
pass a rate structure that would allow SoCal and  PG&E to flow through cost 
increases to prevent them from once again facing  bankrtupcy.  Therefore, 
this plan does not make the crisis go  away.

Grid Lock Our energy transport system is horrible. Just the way many 
utilities like it.

Our energy transport system is balkanized and horribly inefficient. 
Unfortunately, many of the incumbent utilities want to keep it that way. 
The Bush energy plan hits hard on increasing production. That alone won't 
solve the nation's power crunch. ""Supply is not the only issue,"" says 
Michelle Michot Soss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of 
Houston. ""The issue is bottlenecks.""
Some of these bottlenecks are political. A lot of them are created by 
incumbent utilities that do not welcome competition. 
Florida, for example, whose demand for electricity is growing at about 3.7% a 
year, is a net importer of energy. It generates around 24% of its power in 
aging oil-fired plants that should be replaced with more efficient 
combined-cycle generators. These burn natural gas in a turbine and use the 
hot exhaust gases to create steam, which spins a second turbine; they spew 
out less particulate and consume about a third less energy. 
So why doesn't Florida get efficient power plants? First, the state has only 
one main gas pipeline, though others are working their way through the 
regulatory process. More vexing is a state law, zealously defended by Florida 
utilities, that bans outside competitors from building combined-cycle plants 
larger than 75 megawatts--enough to juice 75,000 households--on the dubious 
theory that they waste water. Duke Energy tried to challenge the law with a 
500-megawatt plant in New Smyrna Beach. FPL Corp. (parent of Florida Power & 
Light) fought the plant all the way to the Florida Supreme Court and won. 
Florida's screwy power-plant law is just one example of the byzantine 
regulations that stymie efforts to make the nation's energy grid more 
efficient and prices more competitive. From laws that protect utilities 
against more efficient rivals to outdated state regulations that discourage 
the construction of transmission lines, these choke points either waste 
energy or make it impossible for energy to get where it should go. 
A series of state laws in the 1920s laid down the monopolies on grids. They 
were codified in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, a populist 
law that identified bigness with badness in the electricity business: To 
avoid federal scrutiny and regulation, most utilities decided not to operate 
outside their own state boundaries; rate setting fell to the states. But even 
as wholesale electricity markets have been deregulated, utilities can still 
bat away outsiders by reserving their own transmission lines for ""native 
load."" This allows them to keep an open lane on the energy highway, as it 
were, to rush electricity to certain customers when their demand suddenly 
spikes. 
In such areas as the Southeast, the owner of a transmission line has a pretty 
free hand in calculating what its native load is. So Southern Co., which owns 
utilities in Georgia and four neighboring states, can determine how much 
power to let into its territory. 
Southern Co. defends the rule, saying its primary job is ensuring customers 
get all the power they need. ""The marketers would like to schedule another 
10,000 megawatts of power to go across our lines tomorrow,"" says William 
Newman, a senior vice president. ""It's not going to happen. The system wasn't 
designed for it."" 
Enron disagrees. Utilization of its natural gas pipeline system increased 50% 
in the five years after the gas market was deregulated. Steven Kean, head of 
government regulations at the Houston-based giant, thinks similar gains are 
possible in electricity if companies like Southern are forced to hand over 
control of the grid to independent regional boards that will determine how to 
allocate power flows and where to build new lines. The utilities ""don't want 
to accept the economically pure solution,"" he says. ""Once utilities have been 
adequately compensated for their stranded costs, then it's time for them to 
shut up, sit in the corner and let the economists and lawyers work out the 
details."" 
Lawyers and economists making decisions for us? That doesn't sound like 
deregulation. But there is a case to be made for separating control of power 
lines from control of other utility assets. Phillip G. Harris is chief 
executive of PJM (it stood for Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland), a regional 
power line organization. Since this independent system operator was formed in 
April 1997 and six local utilities ceded control over transmission lines, 
reliability has gone up and prices down, he says. Where Southern Co. will 
only add transmission capacity if it has a firm contract in hand, PJM can 
order lines to be built. Its member companies are spending $311 million over 
the next three years on new lines to increase the flow from power-rich to 
energy-poor areas. 
Last May temperatures hit the highest levels since 1930 at the same time as 
15,000 megawatts of PJM's 59,000 megawatts were out of service for 
maintenance. As the peak load rose to 51,000 megawatts--7,000 more than was 
available within PJM--power streamed in over a dozen entry points. Prices 
topped out at $432 a megawatt hour. That's about four times what you are 
probably paying for residential service, but it stands in contrast to spikes 
in the thousands of dollars in California and the Midwest during similar 
crises. 
Unfortunately, what works inside PJM doesn't transfer to Los Angeles, much 
less to Manhattan. Different rules regarding electricity transactions and a 
shortage of transmission lines make it difficult to export electricity across 
the Hudson River. When Hydro-Quebec tried to build a power line across Long 
Island Sound in 1999, Connecticut nixed the idea. Ostensible reason: the 
possibility of harm to oyster beds. Real reason: Folks in New Haven asked, 
what's in it for us--and didn't see any clear benefit to them. There is, 
unfortunately, no mechanism for buying off losers in these deals, such as 
property owners near, but not under, the power line. So they hire lawyers and 
talk solemnly about oysters. 
California's bottleneck is on Path 15, a 500,000-volt transmission line that 
links the northern and southern halves of the state. Path 15 can't 
accommodate the flows of power needed when the weather is cool in San 
Francisco and hot in L.A. But the legal and financial chaos in California, 
with the state on the verge of taking over much of the transmission system, 
discourages investors from backing an increase in capacity. ""If we put in 
good rules on how to operate transmission systems, you would see investment,"" 
says Lawrence Makovich, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
""The problem is right now there is no such plan."" 
Enron is trying to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take 
charge, so far to little avail. In a case pending before the U.S. Supreme 
Court, Enron accuses FERC of abdicating its responsibility to do for 
interstate trading of electricity what it did for trading of gas. 
But forcing FERC down that path will be difficult. Natural gas producers 
needed interstate pipelines to get to big markets in the North, which needed 
the gas. But incumbent (and politically connected) electric companies have no 
such incentive to stimulate a national market in electricity. ""There's not a 
single incentive in the entire U.S. to relieve congestion,"" states Jeanine 
Hull, president of Strategic Energy Advisors and a former power-company 
lawyer. ""Ask yourself this question: If you had a chance today to retain your 
monopoly or compete, which would you choose?""

US Sen. Feinstein Urges Hearings On FERC 'Improprieties'

05/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called Friday 
for Senate hearings to investigate ""possible improprieties"" involving the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's relations with the industry it 
regulates. 
""Despite evidence of manipulation and price gouging in both the electricity 
and natural gas markets in California and the West, and a finding by FERC 
last November of 'unjust and unreasonable' (electricity) rates, the 
commission has failed to take the actions necessary to bring reliability and 
stability to the marketplace,"" Feinstein said in a letter to Sen. Joe 
Lieberman, D-Conn., seeking hearings by the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee.
Feinstein cited a report in The New York Times Friday in which FERC Chairman 
Curt Hebert related a phone conversation with Ken Lay, chairman of Enron 
Corp. (ENE). Hebert alleged that Lay offered to bring his influence to bear 
with the Bush administration to maintain Hebert as chairman if the regulator 
would adopt policy positions favored by Enron. 
Hebert is quoted as saying he was ""offended"" by the conversation. Lay 
disputed Hebert's account. 
The Times article also quoted Vice President Dick Cheney as saying Texas 
utility regulator Pat Wood has ""got to be the next chairman of the FERC"" to 
address problems in electricity markets. Cheney's remark is slated for 
broadcast by the public television program ""Frontline."" 
""While Mr. Lay's account (of the conversation) differs, it is clear that the 
citizens of the United States, especially the people of California, who are 
suffering from FERC's failure to do its job, deserve an investigation and 
full public hearing into what happened,"" Feinstein said in the letter to 
Lieberman. 
""FERC is a $175 million-a-year agency charged with regulating the energy 
industry, and it would be unconscionable if any of the nation's electricity 
traders or generators were in a position to be able to determine who chairs 
or becomes a member of the commission,"" Feinstein wrote. 
""Since FERC has refused to fulfill its legally mandated function under the 
Federal Power Act to restore 'just and reasonable' electricity rates, we need 
to ask whether undue influence by the companies that FERC regulates has 
resulted in its failure to act,"" the letter said. 
Feinstein seeks a broad investigation into FERC, and not just an airing of 
the Lay-Hebert exchange, which Feinstein said she sees as an example of ""a 
definite problem,"" the senator's spokesman, Howard Gantman, said. 
""There are very close relationships between FERC and the industry it 
regulates. Some of those relationships could be improper,"" Gantman said. 
Lieberman, who has requested that the General Accounting Office investigate 
FERC's response to the California electricity crisis, will become chairman of 
the Governmental Affairs Committee when Democrats assume the Senate majority 
in about two weeks. 
There was no immediate response from Lieberman's office regarding Feinstein's 
letter.

2093,"Executive Summary
? California Treasurer Angelides Sets Dates for Bridge Loans & Bonds
? California's Supreme Court May See Challenge to ""Plan B""

Angelides on Bridge Loans and Bonds
CA Treasurer Angelides has said that beginning 15 August, the state will set 
up a bridge loan.  The revenue bonds will not be issued until September or 
October.  Angelides is not concerned about a cash crisis in July or August.  
However, he is quite worried about problems with cash flow in October and 
November.  This is based on calculations he has done with numbers from the 
DWR and from other parts of the government, not on payment terms for power.  
He fears there will be a cash management problem.

California Supreme Court to Challenge ""Plan B""
California Attorney Michael Sturmwasser is expected to challenge ""Plan B"" 
before the California Supreme Court on the basis that it results in a 
retroactive rate increase and that it removes the PUC's authority to review 
power purchases.  This is because ""Plan B"" enables SoCal to collect a 
dedicated rate component to pay both its undercollect and its expenses going 
forward.  SoCal (and PG&E) would have to be guaranteed this dedicated rate 
component to be able to operate going forward and remain credit-worthy.  This 
takes the burden of financing the energy crisis away from the state and off 
the state's balance sheet, a key goal of lawmakers.  However, at the same 
time, it also abrogates the PUC from its responsibility to review power 
purchases.  The state cannot give the utilities a blank check (in the form of 
a dedicated rate component) to operate without taking authority away from the 
PUC.  According to the California constitution, the legislature can add to 
the responsibilities of the PUC, but it cannot take away powers from the 
PUC.  At the same time, ratepayers will be paying an additional surcharge for 
power that they have already used.  Sources describe Sturmwasser's case as 
""arguable""; in other words, it has a fair chance of succeeding.  However, 
regardless of whether the challenge succeeds or fails, it is very likely to 
cloud the issue of the bail-out and significantly deflate the prospects of 
the Plan B.

If FERC were to impose cost-based controls on power prices, sources believe 
it might ""go a long way toward avoiding these problems.""  Were this to 
happen, the PUC could declare FERC's rates ""just and reasonable,"" which would 
likely greatly lessen the crisis and keep SoCal liquid.  However, such 
measures by FERC require significant lead time.  Sources state that ""the 
state needs to tease the feds into doing this.""  This can be done by 
conducting studies to obtain current cost data and update the data FERC would 
use for determining the cost controls.  Sources report that this process of 
""teasing"" FERC has not yet started.  This is chiefly because California 
politicians are focused on flat price caps, which FERC is very unlikely to 
impose.  It appears the state is asking FERC for the wrong measures, which is 
delaying the process.  The only way for the state to avoid these 
constitutional issues would be for the state to purchase the utilities, as 
municipal entities would not be subject to PUC regulation.  However, there 
remains very significant opposition to this idea, especially on the 
Republican side.  A state purchase of the utilities would likely only gain 
momentum once Plan B began to fail for the reasons cited above.  
Additionally, a state purchase of the utilities would be less expensive were 
both utilities in bankruptcy.

Sturmwasser is a partner at Sturmwasser & Woocher, a Santa Monica law firm.  
(His offices are on the top floor of the tallest building in Santa Monica, 
overlooking the beach.)  He has been a utilities lawyer for over 30 years.  
His clients include the consumer advocacy group TURN (Toward Utilities Rate 
Normalcy), among others.  Sturmwasser will reportedly look for funding to 
support the legal challenge, but if he cannot find money elsewhere, he will 
likely be able to support it out of his own pocket.

2096,"Re:  the speech.

(1) Both the Governor and Steve Reynolds thanked us for the speech and stated 
that it was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to 
speak.  The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in 
energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders.

(2) I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorp's reaction to the notion 
that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs 
(at the retail level).  Another representative for one of the coal concerns 
made the same comment.  These comments took us towards a discussion of what 
went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity.  

I partly agreed with PacifiCorp--i.e., I agreed that we were in a state of 
transition in the wholesale and retail markets.  I also pointed out that:  
(1) we couldn't look at California and reach any conclusion other than they 
messed up; (2) we didn't have an entirely free market in electricity in the 
West--i.e., it's a hybrid of regulation, etc.; and (3) that the model 
discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity (a point 
that the Gov. also made).  I said that it applies to wholesale electric 
markets in some areas, coal markets, gas markets, and that the model applies 
in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated.  

I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling, restructuring 
etc., because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to 
maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming.  The Governor on a number 
of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction (i.e., away from 
retail).  

(3) Nancy Vanderberg (El Paso--a former Enron employee) sends her regards.  
She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming.  
I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers.  

(4) The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from 
competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill 
off smaller local competitors.  I responded with the usual--make sure no 
barriers to entry, when the price gets high enough competitors will take on 
WalMart, etc.

(5) Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately.  
In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on 
RTOs, ensuring that all customers are treated the same, etc.  The Gov. gave a 
number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West, etc.

(6) The Gov. mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy 
resources available to producers in Wyoming.   He also pointed out 
deficiencies in Wyoming-East connections on both gas and electric as well as 
deficiencies in Wyoming-Calfornia pipeline constraints.  


A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne (FYI)

(7) The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission (Steve 
Reynolds) are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron.  I 
affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be 
contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient.

(8)  These guys are serious and dedicated.  The Commission was given a $1 
million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on 
behalf of the state.  During the meeting the Commission approved a series of 
additional meetings, working groups and advisory committees.  Sue Landwehr 
and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the 
meetings, working groups, etc.

(9) My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor 
and the Governor's staff are familiar with how commodity markets 
work--particularly ag products.  They understand the concept of basis and 
also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is 
adequate transmission capacity, gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity.  
They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission 
system (a complete constraint moving east, off-peak constraints moving north, 
south, and west), limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline 
serving the state (Kern--perhaps due to downstream constraints), and some 
problems with the cost of rail transportation (if not a constraint).  While 
they have a working understanding of all these things, they haven't been able 
to put it all together in a cohesive way.  

(10) Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west (and the rest of the 
country), but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent 
state.  (For example, the state moved from a $250 million deficit in FY 1999 
to an approximately $750 million surplus in FY 2000).  They also want to 
diversify the state's economy and bring economic development.  For example, a 
major focus of the state's Business Council has been to recruit ""server 
farms""--because of their load and high load factors.  They talked about 
co-locating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state 
(which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available). 

(11) The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging.  In his 
comments to the Commission, PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the 
state should clarify the utility's responsibility to either:  (1) build their 
own power plants; or (2) acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge.  Steve 
talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how 
the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in 
2000/2001--because the generation acted as a hedge against market prices.  
Steve was also supportive of gas restructuring at the retail level--but 
silent on electric restructuring."
2097,"Greetings Senator:

I'm informed that Mr. Lay is currently out of the country and that your 
message has been forwarded to him.

In the meantime, I am attaching a document that Ken Lay distributed to 
business leaders at meetings in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles about 2 weeks 
ago.  It is the document referenced in the Dow Jones wire story and does 
include the Company's view that a core/noncore market structure is the right 
answer for California (though the document has not been shared with Speaker 
Hertzberg).  

Mr. Lay discussed the core/noncore proposal extensively during his trip to 
Sacramento several weeks ago when, as you recall, he visited Sacramento and 
met with a variety of legislators from both sides of the aisle to discuss 
solutions to California's electricity crisis.

But unlike the Speaker's core/noncore proposal that I read about in today's 
San Francisco Chronicle, Enron's the proposal does not shift all of Edison's 
past due amounts from small consumers to California businesses. The Company 
believes that all customers should be responsible for the costs that have 
been incurred on their behalf.

I will be in Sacramento on Monday, June 4th and would like to discuss our 
proposal with you further if you would find it useful and if your schedule 
permits.  I'm also available to discuss the proposal further by phone if you 
would like to talk before Monday.

If there's anything else I can do, or if you have any questions, don't 
hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff Dasovich

PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

'Blackout' is a FRONTLINE co-production with The New York Times 
BOSTON, June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- FRONTLINE and The New York Times join forces 
to investigate the story behind the California energy crisis in ""Blackout,"" a 
new documentary airing Tuesday, June 5, at 10 P.M. on PBS (check local 
listings). Through interviews with utility executives, industry insiders, and 
state and federal officials, the one-hour documentary examines how profits of 
both power companies and energy-trading giants have soared amid a 
deregulation process that has produced blackouts and rate hikes for 
consumers. The program also explores why the federal government refused for 
months to intervene in the California crisis, as well as the rationale for 
dismantling the old system of utility regulation.
""Blackout"" examines the importance of a new kind of megacorporation: giant, 
national holding companies that trade electricity and gas much like any other 
commodity. With names like Enron, Dynegy, Reliant, and El Paso -- and with 
close ties to high-ranking Republican and Democratic officials -- these 
energy traders have seen their profits explode in recent years even as 
consumers endured power shortages and rate hikes. 
FRONTLINE and The New York Times interview key figures on both sides of the 
energy debate, including Vice President Dick Cheney, California Governor Gray 
Davis, Enron CEO Jeff Skilling, and Curt Hebert, chairman of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). State utility executives and citizens' 
advocates, who charge that California's deregulation fell prey to market 
manipulation, are also interviewed. 
Following the broadcast, viewers can learn more about the energy crisis by 
logging on to FRONTLINE's companion ""Blackout"" Web site -- 
http://www.pbs.org/frontline/shows/blackout. In addition to articles and in- 
depth interviews on the power crunch, the site will feature graphs and 
timelines illustrating the origins of the California crisis, America's 
historical and projected power usage, and the profits of the major power 
companies and energy-trading giants. The site also will offer an analysis of 
the Bush administration's energy plan.

California's Governor Orders Regulators
To Slash Electric Rates in Southern Areas

By ANDY PASZTOR and JASON LEOPOLD
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Gov. Gray Davis ordered California utility regulators to
immediately slash electricity rates in southern parts of the
state by about 50%. The move threatens to ratchet up the
political debate over high power prices and could end up
pitting California against federal regulators.

If the appointed Public Utilities Commission approves such a
rollback, typical residential electric bills for some 1.1
million customers would shrink to about $55 a month from the
current $122 level, according to Sempra Energy's San Diego
Gas & Electric Co. unit. Rates have nearly doubled in the
past three months. The governor's plan also would
essentially freeze rates for the next two years.

Cap for Electricity Once Again (Aug. 2)

Stretching from the Mexican border to the southern part of
Orange County, the region affected by the order has been
hard hit by steep price spikes stemming from local power
shortages, regulatory confusion and unusually hot weather.
As a result of deregulation, area consumers in July 1999
became the first California residents to pay market prices
for power.

While the utilities commission isn't slated to hold an
emergency meeting until Aug. 21, commissioner Richard Bilas
said that Wednesday's announcement already was branded as
""extreme"" by some state lawmakers who accused Gov. Davis of
trying to ""pre-empt the legislature"" by capitalizing on the
politically charged issue. The legislature previously had
scheduled to take up the issue of proposed rate rollbacks as
early as Thursday.

The state commission last week rejected call for mandatory
rate reductions. But Wednesday, commission president Loretta
Lynch said the governor is ""calling for the right thing"" to
provide ""price relief and some predictability"" to San Diego
customers. The governor also announced an agreement with
grocery store operators that could result in as much as a
10% voluntary reduction in energy use by such stores when
power supplies are especially tight.

Democratic State Sen. Steve Peace says that consumption in
fast-growing parts of the state, like the San Diego area,
have surged to levels that weren't anticipated until 2015.
Mr. Peace, the architect of deregulation here, is urging
state agencies not to approve any sales of interests in
power plants owned by California-based utilities until
conditions normalize.

Meanwhile, the Navy isn't waiting for state initiatives.
With its San Diego power bills projected to climb to $39
million from the $20 million budgeted from June to
September, Navy planners have been quietly studying the
possibility of bringing in two of their own generators to
supply electricity to San Diego bases. In addition, admirals
have demanded sharp reductions in power usage, including
orders to turn off all lights in many offices during peak
times. ""We are working by the lights of our computers,"" said
a Navy spokesman. As Sedge's largest San Diego customer, the
Navy uses about 130 megawatts per day during high demand
periods.

Steve Baum, president and chief executive of Sempra, said
the ""electric market is broken"" and all factions must work
together to prevent out-of-state generators from ""gouging""
California residents by selling power ""at unconscionably
high prices."" But he said state utility regulators are
better equipped to find ways to cushion the blow from
wholesale price hikes than are ""instant-pudding bills""
proposed by lawmakers.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? California's Bond Inevitability
? Davis Faces Even Greater Financial Woes
? California's Creditor Status Debated by Court
? Windfall Profits Tax Bill (SB 1X/AB 128X) Passes Senate Vote, Davis 
expected to Sign Off

California Bond Battle
SB 31X passed the Senate today by a simple majority vote, initiating the 90 
day wait period on the revenue bonds issuance.  Sources indicate that 
contrary to media reports, a possible referendum on the SB 31X would be 
unlikely for Harvey Rosenfield to produce within 90 days due to insufficient 
funding.  He reportedly would need to raise $250,000 - $500,000 very 
quickly.  Sources believe that it is more likely that Harvey will attempt to 
set up an initiative later this year or in 2002.

Davis Financial Woes Just Beginning
It is unclear whether Governor Davis truly will be able to move money around 
within the state budget to cover power purchases until August.  Of the $13.4 
billion bond amount authorized, approximately $6.7 billion has already been 
spent on power.  It is likely that the state will spend more than the 
remaining $6.7 billion on power before the bonds are even issued.  Sources 
indicate that most of the long-term contracts Davis talks about are unsigned 
and not really in place.  This means that the state may still have to 
purchase the majority of power on the spot market, which further complicates 
the situation.  As reported earlier, this explains why the Republicans wanted 
to wait for Davis to disclose the terms of the contracts before authorizing 
the bond issuance.  Given the lack of contracts in place, it appears that the 
bridge loan and the bonds will be inadequate for all of the state's power 
purchases.

""To Be or Not to Be,"" Is California a Creditor? 
Sources indicate that lawyers and members of the generator community 
reviewing California's revenue bond bill SB 31X, are unclear as to whether 
the state of California has claims as a creditor.  It appears at this time, 
that the Assembly re-wrote Senator Bowen's language so that the bill relies 
on the existing interpretation of AB 1X as to when the state gets paid by the 
utilities.  This exact issue is currently being reviewed in the PG&E 
bankruptcy case and will most likely settle this ongoing dispute between 
legislatures and utilities.

Windfall Profits Tax
According to sources, the windfall profits tax bill, SB 1X, still remains in 
committee in the Assembly.  It is unclear if this bill could be brought to a 
vote tomorrow given that each house has not reviewed the other's version of 
the bill.  Sources further indicate that the Senate version SB 1X, has not 
yet been referred to an Assembly policy committee and that a ""significant 
reconciliation process"" between the two bills must occur.  For example, 
unlike the Senate version, the Assembly version reportedly does not set a 
price cap based on a firm dollar amount, but instead leaves the decision up 
to a regulatory committee such as the PUC.  Once the bond issuance passes the 
Senate and is officially authorized, the state will likely be able to get its 
bridge loan from the lenders.  However, sources indicate that the bridge loan 
is ""dead"" unless the Senate moves before Thursday.  "

Executive Summary:
? FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives. 
Politically, Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis; from 
an economic perspective, he is unwilling to create disincentives for new 
power generation
? Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan, most notably its exclusion of 
out-of-state generators
? June 1st ""kill clause"" for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional 
plan
? California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade, expected 
$20 billion power bill this summer--economic crisis would force deeper 
Administration involvement
? QF bid for advance payments from PG&E likely to fail in bankruptcy court
? New generation delays probable because of State/QF squabbling
? Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout 
deal

1. FERC Fallout
The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks 
like action, but is not.  Rather, it allows the situation in California to 
continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to 
allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape 
shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the 
Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the 
Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the 
forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps 
on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the 
construction of new generation.

It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were 
generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who 
favors price caps actually voted against this plan. 

2. Something Less than Effective Price Caps
 From Davis's point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws:
? The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west. 
Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to 
California.
? As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power 
than a ceiling.
? State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game 
the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2 
emergency and does not require any collusion.
? Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the 
highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require 
wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the 
cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.

3. Proposal ""Kill Clause"" Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis
The FERC proposal includes a ""kill clause"" that says the caps will be 
withdrawn unless California's ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the 
regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesn't sign on to the 
regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines 
blaming him for letting the ""Bush price caps plan"" collapse.

4. Growing Fiscal Risk in California
Sources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion 
on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of 
PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the 
situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take 
further action to control prices for  power.

The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about 
90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to 
finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.  
The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge 
loans they are providing to California.

The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness 
of the fiscal picture.  The country's largest and most prosperous state will 
have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating 
deficits in a matter of months.

5. QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&E
Meanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the 
bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGE's  accounts, 
since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for 
gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs' request will be granted. If the  
QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw  
of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline.
 
6 Delays Likely in New QF Generation
The QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being 
continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those 
contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.

7. Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan
Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an 
analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a  
utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number 
of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a 
""non-bypassable"" charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even 
if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is 
no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be 
used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would 
be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According 
to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private 
company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for 
the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not  
stand a likely constitutional challenge.  

8. Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power Contracts
The issue of the Governor's failure to  disclose the details of the long-term 
power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.  
Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been 
negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will 
challenged, creating an even further delay.

2121,"Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must 
make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak 
demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with 
porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are 
working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The 
problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply 
enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated 
market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than 
prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and 
Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in 
California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the 
market.

See highlited section of story below.  PG&E's got it right.  Recall that DWR 
was only buying power that it determined was ""priced reasonably.""  
Consequently, the net short wasn't getting picked up.  That meant that the 
ISO would have to go to the real-time market to close the gap.  The ISO would 
then charge the utilities for the power purchased.  Recall that Bob Glynn 
referenced the $300 MM/month that continued to pile up on PG&E's balance 
sheet as one of the several reasons that PG&E put itself into bankruptcy.  
Now that PG&E's in bankruptcy, the state is now responsible for the full net 
short, and can't continue to sluff it off onto PG&E's balance sheet.  So it's 
therefore no surprise that the State's daily bill for power purchases has 
increased dramatically"

You had asked us to check the following CERA numbers:

No new major power plants built in past 10 years
CA economy grew 29 % over past 5 years
Electricity consumption grew by 24 % in same period

Jennifer Thome looked into the numbers and has provided the following:

Most of the media and wire stories use the CERA numbers
According to Margaret Carson, there are two main problems with CERA's 
numbers:  1) consumption includes the entire WSCC region; 2) economic growth 
figures are in 1996 dollars
CEC and other CA state agency sites do not provide much updated information 
and Margaret indicated that the state is reluctant to highlight its high 
growth and consumption rates.
Margaret is finalizing a presentation for Rick that provides the following 
figures for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000:
CA Economic Growth:  5.6%, 6%, 4.5%, and 8.7% respectively
CA Electricity Demand: 3%, 0%, 4% and 9% respectively
"
2128,"? Sources report that SoCal Chairman, John Bryson, and Governor Davis were 
roommates together at Stanford in the early 60's.  This longstanding 
relationship may provide some explanation for SoCal's willingness to 
negotiate with the governor and the governor's determination to reach a 
solution with SoCal.

? Voluntary bankruptcy reportedly is ""not an option"" for SoCal.  However, the 
possibility remains that SoCal's creditors will take them into involuntary 
bankruptcy.  If the state's purchase of the transmission assets is delayed, 
it appears that the possibility of this occurring will increase.

? However, the agreement by the state to purchase SoCal's transmission assets 
is actually a Memorandum of Understanding. The agreement reportedly was 
rushed for ""political purposes,"" but the details still remain to be decided.  
It is possible, the 60-day deadline stated in the memorandum may have to be 
extended.

? PG&E reportedly refused to part with its transmission assets in its 
negotiations with the governor.  PG&E makes more money on transmission than 
distribution of power, the opposite is true for SoCal."

They will strongly support the end of the buy-sell requirement and express

we'd have a similar message on that issue.
FERC should ""PJM"" the California market--I told him we would differ 
significantly on that issue, i.e., PJM-ing generaly, and ""merging"" the PX and 
the ISO.
He said his comments on ""refunds"" would be ""narrow"" and would point out that 
the FERC staff report says there is evidence of specific ""bad actors"" and 
that those bad actors should be required to give refunds--I told him that our

2133,"Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power 
to the state, a U.S. court rules.
By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton
BEE STAFF WRITERS
(Published April 6, 2001) 
In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a 
federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order 
that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state 
without guarantee of payment. 
State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but 
could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant 
off-line for maintenance. 
On March 21, citing ""rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California 
landscape,"" U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction 
against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators. 
Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20 
percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found 
that loss of that production ""poses an imminent threat."" 
But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown ""a high 
likelihood of success on the merits"" of its appeal. 
While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the 
question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel 
directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in 
July. 
The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least 
temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which 
maintains and controls power transmissions. 
It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any 
of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers. 
""It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change 
anything over the weekend,"" said Detmers. ""But if Reliant decided on a 
unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely 
could have a system emergency."" 
Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but 
declined to specify their next move. 
""Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California,"" said company 
lobbyist Marty Wilson, and ""is still of a mind to want to cooperate."" 
Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District 
Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co., 
alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and 
production of electricity. 
The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of 
interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales 
into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order, 
and that goes directly to an appellate court. 
The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two 
other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though 
the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly 
in debt. 
Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay 
their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to 
the utilities. 
The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston 
and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & 
Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue 
supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to 
sell to companies that are not creditworthy. 
But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can 
rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice. 
""My hope is this is a temporary setback,"" said Robinson. He added, however, 
that the practical effect is ""at least for now, we don't have a tool to 
compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do"" -- respond to 
emergency demands for power. 
Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no 
jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators 
and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must 
settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs. 
In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special 
expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO. 
""Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court 
agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper,"" he 
said. ""But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short 
supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at 
risk."" 
Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for 
the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend 
the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its 
view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has 
jurisdiction. 
Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday. 
In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for 
energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big 
utilities and sell its power on the open market. 
Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants 
that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in 
Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell 
its power to PG&E. 
The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative 
energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell 
their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state. "
2134,"FYI, EPMI responded to the CPA's RFP for new generation for up to 360 megawatts.  Additionally, Enron Wind responded as well with letters of intent for about 740 megawatts.  Following are the specifics of Enron Wind's response:

2135,"We will need to clarify early next week the exact status of the Second
Extraordinary Session.  Through conversations I had today, it appears as if
only the Senate adjourned the second special session and not the Assembly.
Both houses need to adjourn the second special session otherwise it runs
through November, 2002.  In referencing a Third Extraordinary Session, the
Governor likely assumed that the second special session would be adjourned.
We need to get clarification from Rules as to what this means."
2136,"Richard, etal  --

Attached is the complaint that EES intends to file tomorrow against SCE related to the recoupment of our Negative CTC.  As you aware, after returning our customers to DA recently, our billing department was expecting that the past Negative CTCs would be returned to our customer's accounts - this has not happened nor after conversations with SCE will it occur.  

This complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds.  Primarily EES does not want to pay for Utility charges for our customers while an outstanding Negative CTC balance is due.

One key risk with filing this Complaint is that SCE may consolidate this case with the earlier Complaint that is currently on hold.  Probably not too big of a downside.

We will be paying the bills into the CPUC for holding until the resolution of the Complaint.

Any questions or issues please let me know.

Corbett Introduces Windfall Profits Tax Measure


SACRAMENTO =01) Responding to increasing electricity rates and the
continuing threat of rolling blackouts, Assembly Revenue and Taxation
Committee Chair Ellen Corbett (D-San Leandro) today introduced a
windfall profits tax measure intended to help restore sanity to the
pricing of electricity in California.  The bill, AB 128X, imposes an
electrical power generation windfall profits tax on the windfall profits
realized by power generators, their affiliates, and the middlemen who
participate in California's energy market. However, in recognition of
the fact that some generators are cooperatively working with the state
by holding their costs down, the measure is targeted at generators whose
gross receipts significantly exceed the cost these entities incur to
produce the energy they sell.

""We cannot continue to pay the exorbitant rates that are currently being
charged in today's marketplace.  Consumers and small businesses are
seeing their energy rates skyrocket.  The state is spending $45 million
per day to help meet demand.  We are looking toward a summer of rolling
blackouts.  Yet, we continue to allow some electricity generators and
middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into
the state.  This profiteering must stop, and AB 128X will help us ensure
that it does.""

The windfall profits tax measure imposes an add-on tax equal to a set
percentage of the gross receipts derived from the sale of electrical
power into the state. The measure also targets middlemen who have been
able to game the electricity market by buying up supply and reselling it
at much higher rates.  AB 128X hits these middlemen by taxing the
receipts they realize from excessively high markups.

""As Chair of a working group charged with developing a windfall profits
tax, I look forward to working with my colleagues on moving this measure
through the Legislature.""

"
2138,"FYI.  This is the bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts (recall that the argument to end DA by the Gov's finance folks, the bond folks, and Angelides, the Treasurer stems directly from this linkage).  

Though Hertzberg was initially a supporter, his legal consultant has been scared off by the Gov's people (i.e., to de-link would ""impair"" the contracts, triggering breach, liquidated damages and the end of Western Civilization as we know it).  The Senate ain't buying that line.

As a result, it's now a Senate play, but they need Republicans to get the 2/3's necessary for passage, which ain't likely to be easy.  We urging Brulte to go along, but only  in exchange for deleting the ""no DA"" language in AB1X and for legislative language assuring that DA will continue.

Jeff

 "
2141,"Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

The first point is the most critical.  It exposes customers to exit fees if 
they go DA before the effective date.  If we can argue to the DWR that no 
costs were really incurred by them - in fact, their burden was relieved by 
load going DA - this problem goes away.  Better to clarify in the legislation 
if we can.  Other than that, a couple of the Christmas tree ornaments have 
been taken off.  (These were nice, but, let's be realistic).

Seems to me this is still a pretty good bill!  (especially if we can clarify 
that CPUC's new 3 cent surcharge doesn't apply to DA. )  With either bill, we 
still have the issue of how to measure net avoidable DWR costs for exit fee

2151,"Lynch and Wood Running the meeting

Lynch started out castigating FERC for the ""failure to act"", sellers for high 
prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press package.  
Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net short is 
34%.  Sellers ""have us over a barrell"" for those sales.  Attorney Gen 
continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward costs 
-- this doesn't address the ""$ for the hot dog, which is being taken care of 
in Sacramento.""  She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow 
Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call. 
Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- ""our cries have fallen on 
deaf ears""

Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:

1.  Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order the IOUs to pay the QFs beginning 
4/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Section 390 
(Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the gas index 
from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) to Malin, where 
prices have been more stable.

2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for 
purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power for 
purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that the 
payments are for going forward costs. ""It's time to pay the power bills for 
California.""  CPA calculated based on the ""residual"" method, rather than the 
proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method, 
however.

3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X. 
(The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge 
permanent (didn't say if its additive with the 3 cents) Believe this covers 
ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX 1, small customers 
with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers with 200% increase, 
get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess.  Adopted TURN's 
accounting proposal.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Takes 
IOUs 30-45 days to charge the rates; will conduct a rate design proceeding 
during that time period (see # 5).

4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to see 
if it is best for the public utilities.

A new proceeding was also identified.

5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate 
structure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use)  
Need information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided 
it.  Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above -- 
would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30- 45 days.

In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to go 
after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices.

2156,"Soaring Electric Use More Fiction Than Fact 
Chronicle investigation finds power companies manipulate data to excuse their 
towering rates Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers
Sunday, March 11, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL:

N213155.DTL 

Power companies say it so often, and with such certainty, that it has become 
a virtual mantra: ""Skyrocketing"" energy use by Californians is a root cause 
of the state's power crisis, and justification for surging electricity 
prices. 
But a computer analysis of electricity usage data by The Chronicle reveals 
that the mantra is a myth -- that overall growth in electricity demand hasn't 
been nearly as great as the industry portrays it. 
The industry has painted the summer of 2000 as the equivalent of a 100-year 
storm in meteorology -- an event so powerful and unexpected that the existing 
infrastructure was devastated by its force. 
The statistics show that 2000, taken in total, was nothing of the sort. 
Moreover, two independent state agencies' assessments of California's power 
plant capacity appear to show that the growth should have been easily 
accommodated. 
The companies have defended their practice of increasingly taking power- 
generation plants out of service by arguing that heavy demand and consequent 
plant usage necessitated major, time-consuming repairs. 
""The claims that demand growth is rampant and that it was totally unexpected 
and due to the Internet economy, to Silicon Valley, or server farms, 
or people recharging cell phones -- that's bogus,"" said Tom Kelly, assistant 
executive director of the California Energy Commission. ""About as bogus as 
you can get."" 
The Chronicle's findings are based on data collected by the California 
Independent System Operator, a manager of the state's electricity grid. They 
show: 
-- Total electricity consumption in California increased only 4.75 percent in 
2000 from 1999, a sharp contrast to claims of industry representatives, who 
have repeatedly relied on isolated, loose or selective comparisons that make 
growth appear as high as 20 percent. In fact, the single greatest hour of 
electricity usage in 2000 was actually lower than any peak demand period in 
1999 or 1998. 
-- Average peak demand -- the average of the highest hour of electricity 
usage for each day -- increased only 4.79 percent from 1999 to 2000. Even 
during the months of May to September in 2000, when the greatest spikes in 
electricity usage occur, demand growth was only 8.31 percent higher than the 
same period the year before. 
-- More than 30 days of critical power shortage warnings, so-called Stage 3 
emergencies, and two days of blackouts this year occurred at times of 
moderate energy use -- levels often below those at which neither warnings nor 
blackouts have occurred in the past. 
The findings appear to buttress suspicions that the ""skyrocketing demand"" 
explanation for rising energy prices is a cover for what is really happening 
-- 
that power companies have simply started charging more for an essential 
commodity, regardless of whether it is in short supply. 
Presented with The Chronicle's findings, Gary Ackerman, a representative for 
the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade group representing power companies, 
said the calculations support the industry position that electricity demand 
is growing strong. 
""That's pretty healthy growth for California as opposed to the long-term 
historical average, which is close to 2 percent,"" he said. ""To me, that's 
really strong growth."" 
Energy demand is certainly on the rise in California -- growth of more than 4 
percent is still double what was projected -- and the state has obviously 
fallen behind in building power plants. 
Even though a recent study found California ranked 47th out of the 50 states 
in per-capita energy consumption, the surging demand explanation has become 
so accepted that leading officials accept it as gospel. Gov. Gray Davis has 
made energy conservation -- 10 percent, at that -- a centerpiece of his 
efforts to solve the crisis. 
""Energy use is growing,"" said state Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, citing 
the growth of Silicon Valley and high-tech operations statewide. ""There's 
been tremendous growth, whether manufacturing or high tech -- cell phones, 
faxes, whatever. The stuff is growing."" 
Yet the energy industry has been steadfast in its insistence that the 
consumer is largely to blame. In testimony and submissions to government 
bodies considering prescriptions for the crisis, energy demand growth has 
consistently been overstated. 
Joe Bob Perkins, the chief operating officer of Houston-based Reliant Energy 
Inc., told the U.S. Senate in January that California's growing economy and 
high summer temperatures caused electricity use to ""surge dramatically"" -- a 
demand growth of 13 percent. 
Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said Perkins' testimony was based 
on estimates by the federal Energy Information Administration of monthly 
retail electricity sales. 
""We do stand by that,"" Wheatley said. ""Unfortunately, it does not track with 
ISO data."" 
The industry-backed Edison Electric Institute said in a report that 
electricity demand grew by anywhere from 5 percent to 21 percent during the 
spring of 2000, compared with the same period a year earlier. 
Russell Tucker, an economist for the institute, said the group's figures were 
derived by identifying the single highest hour of electricity demand for each 
spring month of 1999 and 2000 and comparing them, finding the May peak rose 
21 percent. 
Granted, the state Energy Commission uses the same model to determine whether 
California has enough plant capacity to meet demand. But the presentation 
makes it appear that overall demand, not just the absolute peak, is growing 
by 21 percent. When the peak of each day is averaged and compared from year 
to year, May's figure was much lower: 12.79 percent. 
Also, nowhere did Edison's report note that the peak hour of 2000, a load of 
43,784 megawatts on Aug. 16, was actually lower than the peak hours of either 
of the previous two years -- 45,884 on July 12, 1999, or 44,406 on Sept. 
1, 1998. 
The Chronicle analysis of average peak demand showed that no month last year 
grew more than June's 15.34 percent, though no blackouts occurred in that 
month. May and June were the only months when demand growth exceeded 10 
percent, the analysis showed. Most months recorded 4 percent or 5 percent, 
and some -- such as September -- were less than 3 percent. 
Two months, October and December, had demand levels lower than the year 
before -- 4.22 percent less for October, 1.46 percent lower for December. 
Mike Florio, a consumer lawyer and board member of the ISO, said that even 
growth of less than 5 percent from 1999 to 2000 would seem overstated, since 
1999 was a relatively mild weather year and 2000 was a much hotter one. ""You 
are quite right,"" Florio said. "" 'Skyrocketing' demand is a myth."" 
MARKET MANIPULATION?
Consumer representatives and some politicians have long suspected that, 
rather than dire imbalances between supply and demand, market manipulation is 
behind the crisis. 
Generators and power marketers adamantly deny this, saying they have done 
everything they could to keep the lights on. They say they ran aging, 
decrepit plants at higher-than-normal levels last summer to accommodate what 
they described as unprecedented demand. They also say that, at great expense, 
they delayed much-needed maintenance in order to keep the power flowing. 
Their claims have received some support from the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, which said in a report last month that it found no evidence power 
companies were using maintenance schedules to manipulate supply. The report, 
however, was heavily qualified by the FERC, which said it did not investigate 
other forms of manipulation. Moreover, the agency acknowledged that the bulk 
of its investigation was conducted by simply calling power plants and 
questioning them over the telephone. 
The supply side of the energy equation is harder to penetrate, in part 
because supply data are confidential. Thus, the question of how blackouts 
could have occurred at such low levels of demand in January is hard to 
answer. What is clear is that, at times, during the crisis this year, as much 
as 12, 000 megawatts of electricity supply have been unavailable for use, 
mostly because of unplanned plant outages -- about four times the level 
anticipated by the ISO. 
Power companies say the old plants they bought were not capable of producing 
to the levels sketched out by the ISO and the Energy Commission, and that 
everything from low water conditions, emissions limitations and high 
temperatures last year caused less energy to be available than was 
anticipated. 
But others suggest that what began as a shortage caused by a withholding of 
supply to drive up price has turned into one caused by withholdings out of 
fear of not being paid. 
What did go up, unquestionably, were wholesale electricity prices. 
While average electricity usage during the heaviest hours last year increased 
by less than 5 percent, prices charged by power companies to the utilities 
that deliver juice to consumers increased more than 289 percent. 
In June, the cost of a megawatt hour increased more than fivefold, going from 
the 1999 level of $30.53 to $170.60. In October, prices doubled over the same 
period a year earlier, going from $53.47 to $111.04. And in December -- 
despite a 1.46 percent decline in electricity usage from the previous 
December -- peak wholesale electricity prices hit $425.59. They'd been $31.88 
one year before. 
Then the pace of price increases began to accelerate within the last six 
months of 2000. Overall, average peak usage during December was about 31,200 
megawatts, about a fifth lower than it was in August. Average prices in 
December? They just about doubled, to $425 a megawatt hour. 
The companies' explanation for rising prices despite falling demand was that 
more and more plants had to be taken offline for repairs, decreasing supply. 
Even given the high number of inoperable plants, questions remain about why 
the existing supply could not cover demand. 
On the blackout days of Jan. 17 and 18 fewer plants were offline -- and more 
electricity was available -- than on days when the state managed to squeeze 
by without turning out the lights. 
Even today, with Stage 3 alerts having faded away, at least temporarily, 
demand levels remain more or less the same as when California was in a 
constant state of emergency. Moreover, the lists of offline plants are as 
long as ever. 
AMPLE POWER SHOULD EXIST
The Energy Commission and the ISO have concluded that California's power 
plants are capable of generating more than 45,000 megawatts of electricity. 
That means that even with plant repair outages, low water levels decreasing 
hydraulic generation, air-pollution rules and other environmental 
constraints, the power companies should be able to accommodate all but the 
most extreme spikes in demand. 
According to industry data obtained by The Chronicle, the Western Systems 
Coordinating Council, a government-backed trade group in Salt Lake City, 
concluded California would have considerable surpluses throughout 2000, 
including margins as high as 39 percent in December, based on data provided 
to it by the ISO. Even under low water conditions, the ISO reported, the 
state would have total power resources of 47,532 megawatts in that month. Yet 
unplanned outages were far higher, and the system began to crash that month 
and into this year, at far lower levels of demand. 
""Clearly,"" Florio said, ""we should not be having a shortage at 2 a.m. on 
Christmas Eve, when the only person awake is Santa Claus.""

2157,"Steve - attached is a new chart that paints a clearer picture of the existing 
generation emissions v. new generation emissions.  Some of the units are 
fairly inefficient ('though some of these units are currently in the process 
of ""repowering"" to increase their efficiency) which increases their effective 
emissions.



(see Chart 1)

In thinking more about the discrepancies in emissions b/w existing and new 
generation, it really amounts to a fundamental flaw in the rules for 
nonattainment areas in the Clean Air Act.  These rules have no provisions for 
growth and create a pretty strong competitive advantage for existing sources 
of emissions.  Basically, any new sources in nonattainment areas have to go 
to existing sources and convince them to reduce their emissions.  In CA's 
case - since they have been nonattainment for so many years many of the 
sources of emission reductions have already been tapped.  In other 
nonattainment areas like Houston and Atlanta - the nonattainment geographic 
boundaries are so small that there are only a handful of significant 
stationary sources of emissions.

I don't think CA is going to be able to effect a lot of change on their own.  
It is going to take a Federal legislative fix.

Let me know what other information you need.

"
2160,"I'm not sure the RECs provide an example of an auction supply process.  In 
the first few years after privatisation, many RECs signed long-term PPAs and 
took equity in Independent Power Producers.   They were allowed to pass the 
associated purchase costs through to consumers.  Apart from that I believe 
their purchasing was via a mix of longer-term and shorter term purchases 
mainly off the major generators.  The RECs individual purchasing decisions 
were at their discretion and I'm not aware of any centralised, public auction 
that has been used in the form anticipated in California.  The only example I 
can think of an ""auction"" was in the other direction: Nuclear Electric used 
to sell off its power via an auction style route while in public ownership.

I also can't think of any international examples which fit the Californian 
idea, but I'll rack my brains further.

address how the QFs will actually be paid, and it will specify that no
payment will come from the DWR.

determining what type of security the state will take, hydroelectric,

2202,"Assembly Committee held a hearing on ABX1-18  Hertzberg, the speaker's 
vehicle for allowing DWR to purchase power for the state and to use revenue 
bonds to payoff utility undercollections and to finance ongoing DWR operating 
costs.  We have forwarded by fax the latest version of this bill.    The 
Assembly Committee was only able to discuss three sections of the bill before 
adjourning until 1 pm tomorrow.  Chairman Wright expects to take the 
remainder of the afternoon tomorrow to go through the bill line by line and 
expects to only get part way.  He anticipates no hearings over the weekend 
and more hearings to follow Monday through Wednesday next week.  Thus no vote 
on the bill is expected for a while. In addition, all parties, including 
Wright expect amendments as a result of ongoing negotiations between the 
Governor, Speaker, the utilities and the generators.  These would center on 
the price the generators will bid and how much if anything the utilities will 
have to absorb of past undercollections.  There is no indication at the 
present of when they will show or what those amendments will say.

Initial analysis of the bill raises the following issues:

Most important issue   On pages 3 - 8 of the bill, new provisions are added 
to AB 1890 (Section 368 et al) to define how the TRA and TCBA are to be 
calculated and what the Commission must allow in rates.  These provisions 
appear unduly generous to the utilities and may well provoke an immediate end 
to the rate freeze if enacted.  Here are the main elements of the language.

368.2  The Legislature finds that it is appropriate to allow the utility to 
recover the reasonable costs incurred to purchase wholesale energy.  (that 
means the big under collection from summer 2000 to date)

368.3  New definitions of the ""adjusted TCBA"" and ""net undercollected 
amounts"" are provided which appear to provide for the following way of 
wrapping up transition cost ratemaking.

1.  The TCBA is the positive balance as of 12-31-00 increased by the trust 
transfer amounts to be recovered in rates for 2001, also increased by amounts 
included in retail rates for prior period costs (if any are authorized by the 
CPUC), and also increased by the balances in the generation memo accounts as 
of 12-31-00.  
2.  The new ""net  uncollected amount"" that the utilities could collect in 
rates would be the current TRA account, as reduced by the above defined 
balance in the TCBA as of 12-31-00.  

NOTE: Edison claims this is the same mechanism that Enron proposed to the 
Commission as an alternate to the TURN proposal.  It has similarities to the 
comments we filed Nov. 9, but our official position is still to support the 
from-the-begining netting of the two accounts as proposed by TURN.

3.  There is also language to lock in the CPUCs current ratemaking for these 
accounts so that the TURN proposal to net the TRA and TCBA cannot be 
implemented.

4.  The utilities'retained generation will be put in rate base at book value, 
except for the nukes, which will have their rate base calculated WITHOUT the 
application of overcollections in the transition cost balancing account to 
accelerate depreciation.

5.  The CPUC is supposed to establish a dedicated rate component within the 
existing rates as of 1-8-01 to allow recovery of the net undercollection (the 
large TRA undercollection as reduced per the above).  The undercollection is 
to be amortized over 10 years.

6.  The utilities will not have to buy power if their credit rating drops 
below BBB+.

The remainder of the bill has to do with the mechanism for the DWR to 
purchase power and to have revenue reduction bonds pay for costs in excess of 
those recovered in the utilities rates.  Rod Wright is seeking a ""stop 
loss""provision which will force a rate increase once the DWR has used up all 
its appropriation and all the bond revenues to buy power.  This is 
controversial with the other members.

We have been asked for a reaction by the committee members and would like a 
response ASAP, certainly by mid-day Friday.  This will require balancing the 
concerns about and early end to the rate freeze with the increased likelihood 
of payment for power transactions once DWR is funded.  The prospect of 
successful participation in more auctions is unclear unless more practical 
auction terms are used.  However, the auction process is not spelled out in 
this bill. The generators are supporting an early end to the freeze so that 
they can be paid...I  am in meetings starting early in the am so I will not 
be on the 10:30 call, please send comments to scott govenor..either by e mail 
or by fax, his fax is 9164480816.  I am also interested in how we should

conference was set up with two locations:  one at DOE in Washington and one 
in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage.  It was tentatively set up 
for 2:30 pm CST.  I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve 
Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron.

Long-Term Forward Contracts

Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm.  It includes a 
draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products 
required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1.
Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, 
given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California.


Debt and Forebearance

Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday.


QF Contract Reformation

Parties continued discussion
No information was available by COB Friday.

Major Issues

State interest in resolving
State willingness to raise retail rates
Utilties' desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio manager
Willingness to ""call off the dogs"" for the suppliers and to release them from 
legal action
State willingness to offer up sites for power plant development
Ability to reach deal on QF contract reformation


Next Steps

If definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting, 
this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the 
week of Jan 15.

If agreement is reached, a massive amount of work is required immediately, 
such as:
FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 16.
RFO completion and release by Jan 18
Introduction and passage of necessary legislation to be executed by February 
2.
Preparation of contract between utilities and state (probably DWR)
Preparation of formal agreements among the parties on the terms on this 
settlement

And more..."

Resumes 1/10/01 in WDC.  Enron will continue to attend.

In the Room

Reliant submitted its proposal for blended rates and determining the real gap 
between a blended wholesale price and potential retail rates. Reliant showed 
that the gap is potentially quite small.
Reliant's effort was to move us away from the ""Sharing the Pain"" concept 
offered by PG&E.
Enron again requested utility ideas for a quid pro quo, assuming any deal 
could be struck.
Judge requested additional info from ISO and PX on market shares -- several 
marketers explained their concern (e.g. Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, 
Avista) that this request gave credence to the ""Pain"" allocation proposal and 
refused to give permission to release their data.  Enron said it was checking 
on whether to release the data, but had the same concerns as the other 
marketers on the principles.
Judge decided to use a joint statement for his report (see attached) to the 
public. The statement was agreed to, in large part, by the participants.
Judge mentioned that 40% of the A/S market is apparently held by three 
municipal/alien utilities. 
Judges order urges participation by these parties.


Out of the Room

More bilateral discussions between utilities and gens.
Marketers discuss whether to continue to stay in the room and participate.

2213,"Thanks, Harry.  I want to re-enforce the switching issue, since EES is likely 
to be very focused on moving customers back to the utility on Tuesday.  
Switching would certainly reduce EES' going-forward exposure to 1) growing

the Commission will end the rate freeze altogether"

2218,"Paul:  Here's additional info for the ""curtailment"" data that we're pulling 
together.

Utility Pricing for Core Gas Customers

Prior to the month in question, the utility forecasts gas prices based on 
NYMEX monthly prices.  So for example, based on November's forecast, the 
utility sets prices to be charged to core consumers in December.

When December's over, the utility compares forecast prices with actual 
prices.  If the forecast was too low, and there's an undercollection, the 
utility will increase January's price forecast by ""just enough"" to make up 
for the December undercollection.  If prices were too high and there's an 
overcollection, the utility will reduce January price forecast by just enough 
to refund the overcollection.

If the overcollection/undercollection is very large, the utilities have 
generally spread out the ""true-up"" over several months to avoid ""rate shock"" 
one way or the other.  However, under the current circumstances, the 
utilities may be less willing to spread it out, and may wish to recover the 
entire undercollection in the following month.  In short, there's at least a 
one-month lag in customer prices to account for differences in forecasts 
versus actual."
2219,"In case folks haven't already heard through other sources, a reliable person 
told me that PG&E is hedged for core gas requirements:

financial--for 45% of core volumes at prices ""in the single digits/decatherm""
physical--for 15% of core volumes (via storage) at prices ""less than the 
financial hedge""

SDG&E is naked.

SoCalGas is likely in the same boat as SDG&E, or worse, since they optioned 
core's storage gas to noncore customers, and, those customers are exercising."
2220,"See attached -

As Mike Day has indicated, we are 99% sure the CPUC will bifurcate the PX 
credit payment and DA suspension issues, and vote only on DA suspension on 
Thursday.  This gives more time to work on a SCE PX credit stipulation.

2222,"The following notes are from Ken Smith from State Controller Kathleen
Connell's press conference today:

California State Controller Kathleen Connell held a press conference
today.  Although the Dow Newswire said it would be to disclose long-term
contracts, the event focused on what she believes will be an additional
need for borrowing beyond the energy bonds.

She anticipates an additional $4 billion in borrowing will be needed in
February to meet expected costs.  The borrowing should, she said, be
done as Revenue Anticipation Notes (RANs), short-term notes at a lower
interest rates (about 4%) that must be paid back by the end of the year,
rather than as additional energy bonds.  She categorized the current
budget situation as =01&the same kind of environment as a bad budget year,=
=018
and said California should maintain at least a 3% reserve.

She did not comment on individual contracts except to say there are 17
different contracts.

Charts her office had prepared showed that $5.136 billion had been spent
on energy purchases through 5/17/01; about 99% of that went to spot
market purchases.  There was also a chart that showed projected
expenditures under the Governor=01,s plan to be $8.349 billion for the
period January 1-June 1, 2001, with about 89% of that going to spot
market purchases.  How these numbers work together was confusing =01) I
checked with a reporter, who said he was also unclear.  I=01,ll try to get
this cleared up this afternoon.

An easel held a large photocopy of a $533 million check to Mirant, which
is the largest energy check written to date.   More has been paid to
Reliant =01) she put it at about 25% of total expenditures =01) but =01&we =
have
never written a check to Reliant over $500 million=018 because of the way
they invoice.

She said the Governor=01,s financial assumptions for power =01&do not fit i=
nto
the most likely scenario=018 and that summer conditions will greatly affect
the actual spending needs.  She noted that DWR estimates it will spend
$9.2 billion through June 30, 2002, although the PUC has only authorized
$7.5 billion.

The other significant announcement was that she plans to use her
authority with the Board of Equalization to hold hearings to determine
whether power plants sold by utilities have been properly assessed for
property taxes.  Apparently, they are still on the tax rolls at previous
rates, but she believes the profits recorded by some generators means
the plants may be more valuable than their current assessments.

A press release was not distributed at the event, although there may be
one issued later today.

N48875.DTL 
Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of 
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power 
crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share 
of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of 
California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private 
energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the 
state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting 
to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting 
against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and 
simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most 
of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying 
the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators 
who have also gouged California. 
""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across 
their face because they are robbing us blind,"" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' 
spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state 
Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from 
Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are 
made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually 
used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most 
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and 
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped 
as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events 
that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover 
from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in 
receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, 
an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents 
subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged 
market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, 
received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged 
higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 
million.

2239,"For those of you who don't already know, the Senate passed its version of
the SCE MOU, SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher) which requires users over 500 kw to foot
the bill for SCE's entire undercollection and it eliminates DA completely.
This largely represents TURN's proposal.  The Senate also passed a budget
and has since adjourned until August 20.

The Assembly had been considering two MOUs, ABX 82 (Keeley) and ABX 50
(Wright).  Both bills had difficulty attracting a majority of votes given
their different approaches to dealing with SCE.  ABX 82 for example, had
large users picking up most of the tab for SCE's undercollection whereas ABX
50 split those charges among all users.  Both bills provided for some type
of direct access and ABX 82 also provided for a purchase of the transmission
system.  In light of the difficulty in passing either bill, it appears as if
the Assembly will shelve both proposals today in order to amend SBX 78 over
the summer break.  An internal legislative working group may be formed to
draft amendments but this has not been confirmed.  Large users have begun
drafting extensive amendments recognizing that in its current form SBX 78
has very little to offer.

2259,"Thanks for the note. I will be the first to admit the ClickAtHome program is 
very rich.  We would need to reset expectations but,

Steps to reduce the costs might include :

Domestic - We can reset expectations and add a co-pay on the computers or 
cease the program entirely. 
 - Increase the ISP employee co-pay or cease the subsidy.
Non US - We can stop all efforts in these offices as the costs to implement 
is very high due to tax, legal and logistical research. 

As for the executive participation in ClickAthome, the exclusion of any class 
of employees would cause the computers to be a taxable event to other 
employees ie $400/employee but this is certainly an option.

Kevin- to your question, this was an unsolicited help in managing expenses as 
employees have not been notified about the email box yet.  PR is working up a 
game plan that  reduces any external risks as we inform employees about the 
mail box.

Regarding laptops, this is indeed a savings given the Clickathome program.  
However, the savings cannot be realized until IT makes available high-speed 
network access from these Clickathome machines.  That progress is going 
slower than we had hoped.

2262,"Shapiro Haber & Urmy Files Class Action on Behalf of Purchasers of Enron Corporation Stock (NYSE: ENE) in The Period From July 13, 2001 Through October 16, 2001

10/22/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

BOSTON, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP has filed a class action suit alleging securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), 515 Rusk Ave., Houston, Texas 77002, against Enron Corporation (""Enron"") (NYSE: ENE) and certain of its officers and directors. 
The case was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period from July 13, 2001 through October 16, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").
The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""the Exchange Act""), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period. The complaint charges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion. The price of Enron's common stock plummeted over 20% in just three trading days following disclosure of the financial losses resulting from Enron's dealings with these partnerships.

2270,"Greg -- We are scheduled to tape a video message to employees today from 1 to 2 p.m.  This will run in the ""Up Front"" feature on the intranet.  It is a brief video message (two to three minutes) from executives to employees about current issues and topics at Enron.  Ken Lay has done the first two videos, one about the Sept. 11 attacks and the second about the Chairman's Award.  We would like you to record a message about third quarter earnings and, specifically, about how the company will move forward.   The video will be available for employees to access on Wednesday.  The following is a draft outline for the video:

	Enron has had phenomenal continued growth.  Our third quarter earnings, announced yesterday, marked the 23rd consecutive 	quarter we have met or exceeded expectations.  Our earnings of $0.43 per share was exactly on target with the analysts' 	consensus. 	
	
	Our core business is solid, strong and growing.  Earnings in our core businesses are up 26% from third quarter a year ago.
	
	We also announced a number of one-time charges this quarter.  Ken Lay, Mark Frevert and I have spent the last few months 	conducting a comprehensive review of our businesses, and we have decided to remove some of the clouds that have obscured 	the excellent results of our core businesses.  You should have received a memo discussing our earnings in detail.

	But I want to tell you about how the future looks and how we're moving forward....
	
	Detail....
	
	Detail....
	
	We will discuss the outlook for the company in greater detail at the All-Employee Meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 23 at 10 a.m. 	Houston time.  The meeting will be webcast for employees outside Houston.  Hope to see you there.

We will tape in 50M05.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Enron Employees Watch Their Options Devalue as Shares Fall

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, stock options constitute 5 percent of most employees'
annual base salary, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Denne
said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from another at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

SEC Examining 40 Large Firms for Accounting Fraud
NEIL ROLAND
BLOOMBERG NEWS

07/07/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
C-3
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating about 40 large companies for accounting fraud, and many of these inquiries focus on the companies' top executives, the SEC's chief law-enforcement official said. 

""A lot of the fraud seems to be resulting from executives feeling pressure to beat stock analysts' expectations,"" SEC Enforcement Director Richard H. Walker said in an interview Friday.

The SEC is conducting about 260 accounting fraud investigations, about 2 1/2 times the number of such cases that were filed last year, Walker said. 

In last year's cases, charges were filed against 19 chief executives and 19 chief financial officers, SEC data show. 

Among the large companies that have disclosed that they are under investigation are Xerox Corp., ConAgra Foods Inc. and Lucent Technologies Inc. 

Walker said the number of investigations of large companies this year represents a big jump over last year, though he said the agency didn't have an exact count of 2000 probes of major firms. 

More than half the SEC cases in which charges were filed recently allege that companies reported revenue in the wrong period, usually in an attempt to inflate lagging quarterly earnings, Walker said. 

Accounting executives have said companies often have to interpret dated SEC reporting rules that don't easily apply to changing business conditions, leaving corporations vulnerable to second-guessing by regulators. 

But regulators argue that companies and their auditors may be stretching accounting rules too far simply to appease analysts and investors. 

Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who left the agency in February, made financial fraud the agency's chief enforcement priority during the last couple of years of his tenure. 

Levitt said executives engage in a ""game of nods and winks"" with analysts in an attempt to prop up their companies' stock prices. 

Walker had said Levitt's departure wouldn't affect the agency's investigative priorities. Last month, the SEC filed fraud charges against Arthur Andersen, which agreed to pay $7 million to settle allegations it issued false audit reports about Waste Management Inc. for five years. 

The accounting crackdown comes amid intensifying scrutiny of Wall Street analysts' power to influence stock prices. The government also is probing how major brokerages allocated hot initial public stock offerings in the heyday of the tech-stock boom of 1999 and early 2000.

Accounting Firm Fine a Record Probe: Arthur Andersen agrees to pay $7 million civil penalty in case involving audits of Waste Management.
From Reuters

Los Angeles Times 
Home Edition

Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company 



WASHINGTON -- Accounting giant Arthur Andersen agreed to pay $7 million to settle charges it filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management Inc. in which the No. 1 U.S. trash-hauler overstated income by more than $1 billion, federal regulators said Tuesday. 

The fine was the largest-ever civil penalty against a Big 5 accounting firm, said the Securities and Exchange Commission in announcing the settlement against Arthur Andersen and four of its current or former partners.


Publicly traded companies are required to hire an accounting firm to go over books using generally accepted accounting principles. The firms are supposed to raise any concerns with management and issue opinions about the audits. 

Arthur Andersen, which did not admit or deny the SEC charges, examined Waste Management's books from 1992 through 1996, and issued audit reports that falsely claimed that the statements had been prepared using generally accepted standards, the SEC said. 

The agency added that the Waste Management financial statements that Arthur Andersen blessed had overstated the Houston-based trash company's pretax income by more than $1 billion. 

""Arthur Andersen and its partners failed to stand up to company management and thereby betrayed their ultimate allegiance to Waste Management's shareholders and the investing public,"" said Richard Walker, the SEC's top cop. 

In addition to the $7-million fine, Arthur Andersen agreed to what the SEC said was the first anti-fraud injunction in more than 20 years against an accounting giant. It also agreed to be censured. 

""This settlement allows the firm and its partners to close a very difficult chapter and move on,"" Chicago-based Arthur Andersen said in a statement. 

""The allegations underlying the settlement are limited to one client and reflect work that is in some cases more than seven years old,"" it added. 

Arthur Andersen has served as Waste Management's auditors since before it became a public company in 1971. The company merged in 1998 with USA Waste Services Inc., and the surviving entity took the Waste Management name. 

Arthur Andersen still audits its books, a Waste Management spokeswoman said. 

The company said in a statement that Tuesday's settlement stemmed from an SEC investigation of the ""old"" Waste Management's 1998 restatement of annual financial documents from 1993 through 1996 that were audited by Arthur Andersen.

BRIEFLY / ACCOUNTING Andersen to Settle Sunbeam Shareholders' Suit
Associated Press

05/02/2001
Los Angeles Times 
Home Edition
C-4
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company 



Accounting firm Andersen has agreed to pay $110 million to Sunbeam Corp. shareholders to settle a fraud lawsuit concerning its work for the struggling appliance maker. The settlement is the second-largest ever paid by an accounting firm in a securities lawsuit, said Robert Kornreich, an attorney for shareholders. Boca Raton, Fla.-based Sunbeam, maker of Sunbeam, Oster and other appliances, has battled shareholder lawsuits and has been investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for its accounting practices. Sunbeam's stock became virtually worthless after the company was forced to restate its profit and losses for the six quarters before former Chairman Al Dunlap was fired in 1998. Andersen, formerly called Arthur Andersen, denied any wrongdoing but said it decided to settle for business reasons. The settlement covers at least 10,000 shareholders who bought options in 1997 and 1998.

Thank you and Gary for hosting us on the October 17th ""Getting and Keeping Your Best People"" best practice meeting. We also appreciate the participation of your staff in arranging the meeting and conducting the facilities' tour.

I've received excellent feedback from the utility people attending the meeting. They believe that the ideas discussed in the meeting will help them to keep their best people in these very turbulent times in the electric energy business. The knowledge that you shared will help them to influence change at their companies, relating to both people management processes and the overall internal culture.

Thank you again for hosting us. We'll keep you posted on upcoming meetings with other best practice companies in the event that Enron would like to send someone to one of those meetings.

Dear Mr Ishida

Thank you for your email.

As you are aware based on your conversations with Mr. O'Day, Enron is currently reviewing its operations in Japan, including its investment in EPower. As part of that review, Enron is canvassing the interest of potential investors in EPower. We have already approached two international corporations and will have further discussions with those companies in the coming days. We are also in the process of approaching 3 other international developers which have an interest or a presence in Japan. I understand that Mr. O'Day has been keeping Mr Oda appraised of these discussions.     

While Orix has made a significant investment in EPower, Enron has also made a significant investment. Immediately prior to the September restructuring, we advised Orix that in Enron's view EPower had little or no value. We also indicated that we believed that the business may have some potential future value if the business were restructured and the focus on core projects increased. While progress has been made in the last two months, our assessment of the value of the business remains unchanged.

At this stage, our preferred option is a sale of the EPower business to a third party. If we are successful in a sale to a third party, both Orix and Enron will clearly benefit. If we are unsuccessful, what remains of the capital following wind up costs will be distributed proportionally among the shareholders.

I fully appreciate the implications of Enron possibly ceasing operations in Japan and ask for your understanding and co-operation in these difficult times.

Kind regards

John Sherriff

2291,"FYI.  As you know, we're attempting to find a solution to the ""reasonable 
review"" morrass that's impeding utility forward contracting.  For that 
effort, we've worked with the Portland desk to pull together some educational 
materials to use with a subset of California stakeholders that's trying to 
devise a solution to California's melt down.

The attached graphs show 3 scenarios for the state as a whole.  
1) ""do nothing""  
2) for 60% of IOU short position, split the amount 50-50 and 1cover half the 
amount with 10-year  fixed priced power and the other half with 5-year fixed 
priced power.
3) create a portfolio with a) 25% of short position covered by 10-year fixed 
priced power, b) 20% of short position covered by 5-year fixed price power, 
c) 15% covered by 1-year fixed price power, d) 20% covered by May-Sept 
fixed-price power, and e) 15% from the PX.  

The term of each scenario is 5 years.

Because each is priced off our our curves, the average price is roughly 
equivalent for each of the three portfolios.  However, the graph shows (as 
one would expect) that exposure to price volatility is significantly higher 
under scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3.

The goal is to use the illustrative scenarios to persuade the industry that 
in the short run (i.e., immediately) the utilities should be permitted to buy 
a modest amount of power under 5 and 10 terms, and those purchases (if 
undertaken using a ""DealBench-like"" tool) ought to be ""per se"" reasonable.

If anyone has questions about it, or would like to discuss further, give a 
call at 415.782.7822.

1.  The following is an update re contacting local counsel to review the IM
sections dealing with regulations:

Brazil- I have spoken with Jose Amelio Pinto and Maria Elissa with Tozzini's
firm.  I e-mailed to them last night excerpts from the IM dealing with the
regulations of the Brazilian projects. They have agreed to review the IM
regulatory sections for most of the projects (Elektro, CEG/Riogas, Gaspart,
and Cuiaba I) by today or tomorrow.  They did not work on Cuiaba II or III,
RioGen, or Puerto Suarez and consequently stated that in order to perform
the review, they would have to review all of the documents.  They are
attempting to track down names internally of the firms and attorneys that
worked on those projects.  Do you have any recommendations on who to contact
on these projects?

Argentina - Dr. Jose Martinez de Hoz.  Have called (and continue to call)
two numbers last night and this morning, and have left messages on
non-descript voice mail boxes.  No response.

Bolivia - Ramiro Guevara Rodriguez - Have called six numbers all night last
night and this morning, and have neither reached a person nor a voice
mailbox.  Other numbers/suggestions?

2.  Attached is a doc request list from Tozzini's firm for the completion of
their ongoing review of the Brazilian projects.  They stated that they will
most likely be unable to complete this review until Thursday or Friday due
to the amount of documents and to the fact that they still require more
docs.  Attached is a document request list.  We have already sent all of the
documents in the VE data room.  Can you recommend someone at Enron for us to
contact to fill this request?  I will cc Robert George on this e-mail in
case he has any thoughts or someone he knows who can help respond.

Because the Application will be filed via Edgar, it will be publicly 
available and thus the reason for alerting Mark Palmer and Mark Koenig.

Joe Sutton approved the filing yesterday, and I am waiting to hear back from 
Jim Derrick that  Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling have approved making the filing.  
As soon as I get a ""green light,"" I will make the filing.

Mark Metts and Mitch Taylor will use the Overview to orally brief Sierra 
Pacific.  The important point for Sierra Pacific is that the Application is 
being made by Enron for legitimate business purposes unrelated to the PGE 
sale, and will not affect the PGE application.  In this regard, we have 
expressly indicated in the Application that the PGE application should take 
priority and not delay the PGE transaction, and we will visit with SEC Staff 
to confirm this treatment.  In any event, the SEC would request us to 
identify which application should take priority, and given the fact that the 
Application would become moot following a sale of PGE (and at which time we 
would withdraw the Application), the SEC should concur.

Please call me if you have any questions.  I also previously prepared a 
longer presentation for other members of our management and can provide this 
to you if you need further information.

Regards,
Robert

2301,"Steve:

Dwight Larson asked Steve Angle and me to prepare a list of mitigation 
measures we believe would help get FERC and SEC approval so that the merger 
could close by year end.  Attached is a list that Steve Angle and I put 
together.  Dwight is preparing a summary of our comments (along with others') 
for your review prior to the meeting with Walt Higgins, but I thought you may 
want to see the list Steve and I put together.

A couple of caveats to the list:  First, for vertical market power, we 
propose that PGE release its firm transmission capacity into California when 
Sierra is using the Alturas line (i.e., at times when TANC and SMUD are 
prevented from importing up to 300 MW into California).  However, the cost to 
PGE to release this capacity is apparently great and could have a material 
adverse effect on PGE.  Therefore, we may need to consider other mitigation 
measures -- such as capping the price of power sold by PGE into California 
during these times.  This mitigation is not as clean as a release of capacity 
-- it requires FERC to monitor PGE's sales and FERC could have some concern 
that PGE could game the rules.  Nevertheless, it may be the only viable form 
of mitigation we have.  We did not propose this alternative option in our 
list of mitigation measures.

Second, we need assurance from PGE that the buyback contracts they are 
negotiating in the sale of their generators will not give Sierra market power 
(a concern raised by FERC in the July 26 order).

Call me if you have any questions.  Good luck with the meeting tomorrow.

2305,"I spoke with IPPNY's Executive Director and with the ISO's outside General 
Counsel this afternoon and learned that neither the FERC staff nor the ISO 
Board believes that the $150 soft price cap makes sense for New York. Carol 
Murphy, IPPNY's Exec Director, told me that she had spoken with Dan Larcamp, 
Director of Markets, Tariffs and Rates at FERC, who advised her (off the 
record) that NY's problem is supply driven and that IPPNY should put the 
spotlight on the NYPSC for not doing anything about increasing supply in New 
York. He saw little similarity between NY and California and was skeptical of 
the soft bid cap proposal for NY.  On a simialr vein, Ira Freilicher from 
Hunton and Williams, the NYISO's outside counsel, told me that their was no 
chance of the NYISO Board going along with the soft price cap proposal. He 
indicated that the Board had just concluded a two-day session and had Bill 
Hogan in to discuss the situation, and the recommendation from Hogan and 
others was that NY is not California, and that the $150 soft price cap was 
the wrong approach. Freilicher also reiterated that there was no interest by 
the Board in extending the NYC mitigation measures applicable to the divested 
Con Ed generation to other generation in the City, or to reducing the 
thresholds for market power mitigation, both of which were recommended by the 
NYPSC.  On the other hand, Freilicher indicated that there was very strong 
Board interest in adopting a ""circuit breaker"" mechanism to prevent big price 
runups this summer, and that politically, $1000 bid caps may no longer be 
acceptable. He also reiterated that the Board is interested in getting power 
to step in and change posted market prices after the fact (although in a 2 to 
3 day period, not 60 as had been originally reported) in the event the ISO 
finds that prices were affected by the exercise of market power. In th past, 
FERC has rejected efforts by the NYISO to retroactively adjust prices, and I 
believe refused to allow it in California as part of its Order last week.

In view of the sensitive nature of these discussions, I would appreciate 
folks not circulating this memo."
2306,"This Canadian environmental advocacy group filed at FERC a protest of HQ's 
continuation of market based rates (EPMI also filed a protest).  They note:

FERC's traditional Hub and Spoke market power analysis provides ""false"" 
market share percentages
The Quebec governmental has undermined the Quebec regulator, the Regie, of 
the exclusive jurisdiction in transmission regulation.  They cite an issue 
with 100 km of 735kv lines that were built using ""emergency powers"" to avoid 
the regulatory process.  In addition, they discuss a 1/99 Directive that 
absolved HQ from providing ionformation to the Regie.  Their conclusion is 
that the Regie is unable to question the prudence or usefulness of 
transmission equipment investments by HQ.  (Full protest attached.)

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules

DATE:
May 8, 2001
===========================================================

This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two
post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.

!    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions
generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions
with two exceptions.

!    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be
two minutes long.

!    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five
minutes long.


End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)

As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please
be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments
to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule,
will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.

For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before
a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks


Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)

In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a
number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading
session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new
version of this rule is attached below.

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

(3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is
permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any
order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to
resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled
(GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for
purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market
participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session,
a new order must be submitted.

(4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer
participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on
PRS.

Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does
not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures
contracts.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

in EB552   Cost:  $700.00

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R	An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to Enron's transactions.
R	A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the ""deal space"" and how the financial principals discussed 	relate to 	Enron deals.
R	The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron deal.

We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process

Presto's needs to chnage to 1/3 1/3 1/3 grants rather than all next week, so hold his back.

Louise, Michelle and I just spoke and she is checking the drafts that were prepared this weekend and making some changes. You will have them in batches during course of the afternoon. Obviously these are drafts and will need to be redone before anyone can sign (and potentially changed to modify strike date language in case they elect that option). In addition, I thought we were only focusing on the first 15 names on John's spreadsheet at least for this 2 day exercise? Your list below includes a number further down. I thought we agreed we could hold off on them until next week? I don't think we will be able to get all the 46 done over next 2 days and would recommend we focus initially on top 15 or so.

Kari/Sheila, please be on point to ferry these forms back and forth today and tomorrow. We need someone to focus purely on this for the next 48 hours.

2332,"Louise,

I spoke with John and at most, he believes that 6.5 employees should be currently staffed under logistics, scheduling and risk management.  In addition, overall, the Wellhead desk should create a net cost savings across the scheduling and logistics natural gas organization for the following reasons:

1. The number of schedulers needed on the regional firm desks should be less - 
	a. Scheduling between pooling points is relatively easy
	b. The Wellhead support is responsible for all the scheduling and logistics duties between Wellhead and pooling point - which comprise most of the deliverability risk
2. The Wellhead desk has currently, at most, four schedulers for the whole country - 
	a. How many schedulers are associated with the firm desks?  

In addition, if the Wellhead desk is being straddled with these fixed costs, then all outsourcing deals brought in should be pure margin, no?

I am having Judy Thorne and Kevin Miller dig into the details to verify these points.

 "
2339,"Good question.  I think he has experience using other people's money to get asset deals done - worth asking.  Answer probably depends on a gut feel on how we answer the questions:

Is something changing that increases the number of potential counterparties?
Is something changing that increases the number of products/risks that we can intermediate?
If answer is yes - perhaps we just need more good mid-marketers.
If answer is no - maybe we need someone that can look at bigger regional issues - infrastructure, cross-border basis, etc. 

Have him based in Houston and go for it for 12 months.  If nothing materializes, it's a small investment for a large, neighboring country.

because the sale of Seabrook (expected to occur earlier this year) is an 
automatic termination of the $32/Mwh option, therefore the value was not 
booked.  Since the sale of Seabrook sale has not occured yet and a minimum of 
10 months is required to get state & local, NRC and FERC approvals for the 
sale of Seabrook, we have a positive value surprise to the tune of $10-12 
million (assuming option is booked through 9/01.

Let me know if you want us to take the value for 4th quarter or wait until 
next year to take the income.    Since we have a pact to not hide anything, I 
wanted to make you aware of this situation.

SONATRACH ASK FOR PATIENCE OVER OZ2 PIPELINE CONTRACTS
Algiers - Sonatrach has asked bidders to extend until the end of 2000 offers
made for the $1bn OZ2 pipeline system, designed to extend the capacity of
the crude oil corridor from the central el_hamra oil field to the Arzew
terminal west of Algiers. The extension will allow the company more time to
evaluate the bids
About six companies/groups are understood to be bidding for the three
contracts which are estimated to be worth $220-250m each. They include CCC;
a consortium of Bonatti, with Entrepose and Dragados & Construcciones and
Bechtel. The first two contracts involve the construction of the pipelines
with a third contract for six pumping stations. The recent political changes
in Algeria, combined with internal administrative changes in Sonatrach, are
said to have contributed to the delay.


OIL PRICES RISE OVER ISRAELI CONFLICT
London - Oil prices soared on global markets last night following rising
tensions in the Middle East.
London Brent blend futures rose 72 cents to $31.48 but remains short of a
10-year high $34.98 touched last month. US light crude was up 92 cents at
$32.79 helped by speculators returning to buy oil after a two-week sell-off.
Following Saudi Arabia's warning that Riyadh and other Arab states would not
""watch with their hands tied"" if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria, the cost
of a barrel of crude went up almost a dollar to $32.79 (o22.60) in New York.
Earlier the International Energy Agency set alarm bells ringing when it said
the West was heading into winter with inventories well below the seasonal
norm.
Oil prices have retreated from their 10-year peaks last month after pressure
from the G7 industrial nations on producers to pump more crude and the US
decision to release 30m barrels from its strategic reserve. After briefly
dipping below $30, prices have risen amid concerns that demand will exceed
supply in the coming months, particularly if the violence in Israel leads to
a broader conflict. Oil prices are seen as a threat to the prospects of low
inflation in the West, and yesterday's increases spilled over into bond
markets, where worries about Wall Street and energy shortages had already
driven yields higher.
A wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis over the past 12 days
has killed at least 90 people, mostly Palestinians.


BUY-BACK TERMS SET TO CHANGE
Tehran - In an interview with Petroleum Argus this month, Mehdi Hosseini,
former Deputy Oil Minister for international Affairs and now Managing
Director at Kala, the procurement arm of NIOC based in London, indicated
that future negotiations with foreign oil companies will take place using
more favourable terms.
NIOC is reportedly close to implementing a more attractive buy-back formula.
Since the Islamic Republic re-opened its doors to foreign oil companies in
1997, executives had quietly bemoaned the buy-back formula as offering small
capital returns on huge investments. Despite this, Iran's energy buy-back
projects have so far attracted close to $10bn capital to the Iranian energy
sector. NIOC argues that it is their duty to negotiate terms favourable to
its population rather than to foreign entities. It now appears that in the
face of increased competition for foreign investment from its Gulf
neighbours, NIOC is prepared to compromise. For further details please visit

TURKIOG' 2000 UPDATE

2391,"Attached is an analysis of the probability of a devaluation in Argentina and 
the contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation.  

Long and short of it is - 

Argentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would appear that a 
devaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy. 

Convertibility Law was enacted in 1991.  Large part of the population 
remembers the super inflation of 1989 and 1990.

To devalue the currency, Argentina would have to amend the Convertibility Law 
- this requires  approval of the Federal Congress.

TGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition to the 
Convertibility law, it has protection through its license and regulations.  
Indeed, as you remembered, the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate.

A concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic as 
changing the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation, and it is willing 
to suffer the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - then 
there is a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a way 
delink the tariffs of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar.    
In this case Enron would have protection under the BIT treaty.

The impact on Enron's P&L is a function of whether or not we use the Peso as 
the functional currency.  If we use the Peso as the functional currency - 
Enron would have a signficant negative translation adjustment from a 
devaluation.  If we use the dollar as the functional currency - there would 
be no impact on our income statement.   I will research this further in order 
to ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency.

2436,"Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. ""A"" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a ""must pass"" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is ""at least 
three years away from happening.""

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

2438,"Ken,

I hope things are well with you.

I've taken on in the last year of my 6 year term the regents' chairmanship
and so I am busy working on how to help further accelerate the good things
that have occurred since we brought Art and his team to Houston.  In this
light, I read the recent article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting that
the Kuht-TV spectrum allotment includes substantial unused bandwidth which
we are legally permitted to lease to the private sector.  The Journal, based
on the recent UK auction, extrapolated the overall worth of the bandwidth at
$160 billion.  Needless to say, if we could realize a small fraction of
that, for something from which we currently derive nothing, it could be a
huge boost to our efforts to obtain the additional funding we need as we
move to Tier One status.

Since Enron is the leader in the market for bandwidth, I was hoping you or
someone at Enron could give us some advice on what we own, its value, if
any, and how we might think about realizing on any such value.  From Enron's
perspective, perhaps there is a niche market for Enron to make by helping
organize educational institutions that own such bandwidth to exploit the
value of that asset.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards.

From : Gavyn Davies, Goldman Sachs

Re - The Global Oil Price Shock


Since our meeting in Houston, the spike in world oil prices has gripped the
attention of financial markets. I attach a paper which analyses the genesis
of the present oil price increase, the likelihood of it proving permanent,
and the probable impact on the world economy.

The bottom line is the following:

1. The recent increase in the oil price has been due fundamentally to
an increase in global demand, and not to the activities of OPEC, operating
as an oil cartel. In fact, OPEC does not seem to have enough immediate
supply headroom to make much difference to the situation for many months.
The danger of shortages will therefore be very acute this winter, even with
normal weather conditions. This could lead to temporary spikes in the price
to well over $40/barrel. We see a similar situation, or worse, developing in
natural gas.

2. However, we do not see this situation as permanent. In terms of deep
fundamentals, the equilibrium price for oil in the long term is still only
about $18/barrel. Within about 12 months, a large increase in the supply of
oil should push prices back down again, possibly quite sharply. Our present
forecast for the average oil price in 2001 is $27/barrel, somewhat below
today's spot price levels. But we do not expect to see this oil price
downturn before next summer.

3. If oil prices do indeed average $27/bl in 2001, this will prove to
be an oil shock for the developed economies which is the same in magnitude
as the Gulf War shock a decade ago. It will reduce net disposable income for
the OECD economies by about 0.7%, and add about 0.9% to headline inflation
numbers. All of these effects will already be in the data by about 2000 Q4,
so on our main forecast there should be little or no further adverse effects
through 2001.

4. On this oil price scenario, GDP growth in the developed economies
will slow from about 3.9% in 2000 to about 3.4% in 2001 - not a bad
out-turn.

5. What if the oil price sustains $40/bl next year? This would give us
another round of effects about the same as those mentioned in para (3)
above. Even then, however, these effects should not be enough to push the
world into recession. Growth should still be adequate at about 2.5-3.0%.

6. The main risks to this conclusion are that a spike in oil prices,
and possible oil shortages, this winter cause a drop in equity prices, and a
large dip in business and consumer confidence. This could then lead to a
more pronounced downturn in GDP next year, especially if it triggers the
kind of correction in the US that Larry and I have been worrying about for a
long time. But this should prove just about avoidable, assuming sensible
policy responses..

7. This may therefore all work out a bit like the winter of 1998/99.
Going into the winter, events occur which make people worry about recession.
Business and consumer confidence, and equity markets, take a dip. But then
things improve, and it all turns out to be a buying opportunity.

8. I hope so, anyway!


Best wishes,

Gavyn

Here is a draft of your talk on ""The Evolution of the Modern Energy Company.""

I have it as a straight talk, but we could fashion together slides and drop a 
lot of this to talking points if you prefer.

There is some new historical material in the front to set up the heart of the 
talk; see if you think it is interesting enough as a lead in.

I'm on your calendar at 9:30 to discuss this or ""The Future of Business"" if 
you would like new information or changes.

Institute, the non-partisan, public policy research organization
<http://www.independent.org>. We provide you with updates of the
Institute's current research publications, events and media programs.

"
2452,"Ken, Jeff , Joe & Cliff,

This is a copy a note I sent to PR(Steve Kean & John Ambler), IR(Mark Koenig) 
and Enron India(Sanjay Bhatnagar & Jimmy Mogal) regarding our internal 
announcement to  EGEP/EOGIL employees in Houston and India on October 13, 
2000.


On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced to employees Enron's 
decision to sell Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidiary that owns 
a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have 
bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it 
extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were numerous 
rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement 
was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Basically we 
said the following:
 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to 
redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has 
exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not 
envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are 
placing EOGIL in the market.
 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we 
will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron 
entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL 
transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.  
 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global 
E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.
 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. 
  a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process
  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale 
process
  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and 
coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development
 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told 
them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a 
PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many 
people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers 
or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with 
the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated 
March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide 
transition services to a buyer.
 
I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were 
for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in 
the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike 
Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can 
be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed 
on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be 
traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I will be 
available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 
713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest 
talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.

This afternoon I notified our partners and the Gov't of India of our 
intention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to 
visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two 
weeks.  While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries 
from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.  As you might 
expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these 
groups.   

I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above.  If you have any 
questions, contact me at the above numbers.

"
2459,"Attached is an analysis of the probability of a devaluation in Argentina and 
the contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation.  

Long and short of it is - 

Argentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would appear that a 
devaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy. 

Convertibility Law was enacted in 1991.  Large part of the population 
remembers the super inflation of 1989 and 1990.

To devalue the currency, Argentina would have to amend the Convertibility Law 
- this requires  approval of the Federal Congress.

TGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition to the 
Convertibility law, it has protection through its license and regulations.  
Indeed, as you remembered, the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate.

A concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic as 
changing the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation, and it is willing 
to suffer the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - then 
there is a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a way 
delink the tariffs of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar.    
In this case Enron would have protection under the BIT treaty.

The impact on Enron's P&L is a function of whether or not we use the Peso as 
the functional currency.  If we use the Peso as the functional currency - 
Enron would have a signficant negative translation adjustment from a 
devaluation.  If we use the dollar as the functional currency - there would 
be no impact on our income statement.   I will research this further in order 
to ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency.

2462,"Dear Mr Lay,

I write to you as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Enron
Corporation because I would like you to know that I am on my second period
of sick leave in a year due to work related stress.

A year ago I was apologised to by the Human Resources Department and told
that they would not allow it to happen again.  Through constant pressure and
the unfair way in which I have been treated, the advice of my doctor and
counsellor, as they are concerned with my health, was to accept the
voluntary redundancy which had been offered to my colleagues and myself
recently.

Though due to my exceptional circumstances I wrote the attached letter.

Today I received the attached response and I feel totally devastated that
Enron Europe will not compensate me fairly for how they have affected my
life and that of my family's.

I read in Enron's literature that you care about your employees and their
families, and feel that your code of ethics should have offered me
protection against the circumstances that I find myself in, but to my
complete and utter dismay I find this is not the case and  in my
experience I have suffered a great deal and this seems to have been totally
ignored in the response letter.  I haven't once been contacted by Enron
Europe to see how I'm coping and give me any support whatsoever.  They are
showing no care or concern for me or my family.

I write to you for help in this matter and to conclude this stressful
situation that I find myself in due to your company.

Under the circumstances and increased stress that the response letter has
put upon me, I would be most grateful if you would respond to me as soon as
possible.

Yours sincerely

post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his=
 overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/28/=
01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wide=
out is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  =
James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight=
 passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami=
 receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne ,=
 RB NYG - The Nice Machine Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards=
 on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good num=
bers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer =
, WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for =
109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy play=
er, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - The Executi=
oners Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but w=
as held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, bu=
t the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move th=
e ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for =
190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, no! w ! th=
e erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce =
Staley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday ag=
ainst Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, wi=
th two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush =
defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears no=
ting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which sugge=
sts that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both ris=
ky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 10/28/! =
01!  Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadel=
phia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured ba=
ck while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Exe=
cutioners Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns =
and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall=
 challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with bet=
ter stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhacker=
s Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunda=
y against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lo=
t for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was st=
ill a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he shoul=
d break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half =
of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Pit=
tman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been muc=
h better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player wi=
ll be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Bosto=
n , WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes fo=
r 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inco=
nsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy=
 player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's=
 easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, =
I did it again Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns=
 and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how i=
nconsistent he can be. Unless! t! he matchup dictates otherwise, you should=
n't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Su=
nday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' def=
ense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the match=
up, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit w=

L - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 ya=
rds, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23=
 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't g=
reat for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' seconda=

2555,"California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state. "
2556,"FERC Staff Issues Favorable Draft Environmental Impact Statement on 
Guardian Pipeline

     The FERC Staff has issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement
determining that construction of Guardian Pipeline would have limited
environmental impact and would be an environmentally acceptable
action, based on its proposed and other mitigation measures. The
Draft covers the environmental aspects of constructing and operating
the 149-mile Guardian Pipeline. FERC will take written public
comments on the Draft until August 28th, and will conduct four public
meetings along Guardian's route starting August 14th. It will
address
the comments before issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement on
the project. A final decision on the Guardian Pipeline expected early
next year. The Guardian Pipeline will transport volumes from
interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern Gas
Transmission, and NGPL at the Chicago hub to northern Illinois and
southern Wisconsin markets. The project will consist of a 25,000
horsepower of compression and 141 miles of 36 inch pipeline extending
from Joliet to the Ixonia, WI, with an additional 8.5 miles of 16
inch pipeline extending from the main Guardian line to near Eagle,
WI.

Title: Midmonth Report: Early Warning
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1420 ,

*********************************************************

After a warm October, the first cold weather this year
has provided an early warning of what winter could bring
for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the
great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating
markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge
in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British
thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound
in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply
and moved the price of gas back above that of residual
fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of
gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow
most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap
extends through the remainder of November, a heavy
early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for
unprecedented high prices through the winter.

Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750
billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record
low heading into the heating season, and even a normal
winter would reduce inventories to a near record or
record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness
places the gas price playing field in the broad
territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf
Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next,
difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance
could come from switching to distillate oil, but low
distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean
that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per
MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely
drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a
combination of some switching to resid in industrial
boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end
users may be required. None of these measures comes
easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed
by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold
weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price
volatility at levels above the price of resid and
extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather
forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects
Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see
Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time
high for December. But even this estimate could prove
low. If the current cold snap extends through early
December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00
per MMBtu range.

Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum
CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a
maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record
low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this
level was reached only through a fortunate combination
of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent
warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is
likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong
way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to
offset warmth early this month, increasing the
withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on
average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of
the past two years. By the end of this month, the US
inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to
350 Bcf.

CERA estimates that normal December weather would
require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf
per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per
day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would
apply consistent pressure in the market through December
and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to
reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996
all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as
inventories remain on this path the pressure does not
end even with the end of winter, as a significant
increase in injections next year would be required for
inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf)
by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to
help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the
magnitude required both to offset power generation
demand growth and to allow this increase in storage
injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced
out of the market.

Demand-Keeping Warm
After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong
rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and
forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter
(November through March) was the warmest of the decade,
and there will be a significant rebound in heating
demand in the residential and commercial sectors as
weather returns toward normal this heating season.

Under normal weather conditions,
* Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5
Bcf per day higher than last year's.

* Monthly average heating demand through the winter
would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day
in January.

* December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per
day relative to last December.

Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further
increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to
normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal
scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day
relative to normal weather.

Fuel Switching
With natural gas markets this tight, there is
significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the
market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic
to price in the short run, which leaves industrial
demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the
market. This winter we expect

* all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an
alternative to gas to do so

* a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of
demand for power generation relative to last winter

* industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500
MMcf per day off of gas

* gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil
prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas

For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of
4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf
per day increase in demand relative to November, with
increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel
switching.

Supply-The Rebound
The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage
inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to
rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48
capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the
soaring gas-related rig count.

* The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of
Mexico is related to the combination of

- the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt
discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup
of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf
per day later in 2001

- the response of the shallow water to the strong
late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity

* Other important capacity additions are occurring in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in
2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play
in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in
Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam
play.

* Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New
deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs
are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older
rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining
rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling
companies struggle to round out drilling crews.

Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West
Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies
prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and
triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and
Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is
exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has
contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per
MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in
the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through
February, with significant widening in differentials as
heating loads decline.

Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but
the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance
is delayed once again, this time until December 1.
Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA
estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf
per day. During November that total should climb to 750
MMcf per day, despite the later published start date.
With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound
in midwestern demand relative to November and December
last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant
premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast,
differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to
spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into
the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:
* Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has
brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub
prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East
will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating
demand in the region will keep differentials within
about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects a December average differential of $0.25 per
MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show
significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm
week in the Rockies could still push differentials
toward $0.50 per MMBtu.

* San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close
to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant
pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads
in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub
differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies
pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin
to average $0.20 per MMBtu.
* Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the
rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub
and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to
trade within a relatively narrow range during the
winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either
east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA
expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per
MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per
MMBtu for December.
* Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are
now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the
onset of the heating season has offset those increased
flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15
per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in
the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the
strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December
differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect
to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub
at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices
$0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of
this increased basis differential is caused by fuel
costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from
the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would
have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at
$5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite
additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast
from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no
additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this
gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000
MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the
capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's
weather be colder than normal, we could see severe
spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000.
These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in
January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and
the extent to which new electric loads are realized.

Canadian Markets-Winter Begins
The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in
western Canada but is only now being felt in the East.
Storage peaked in the West in early October at
approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf
below the five-year average. Even with modest
withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are
still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs.
Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing
levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well
above the five-year average. With the eastward movement
of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin.
This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with
the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada.

The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal
""freeze-up,"" which bodes well for a longer winter
drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to
reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next
year.

Further Delays for Alliance?
The ""commercial"" in-service date for Alliance has been
delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of
problems with clearing the line, delays in the
completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant,
the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline
has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up
since September. It is estimated that flows for November
will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the
full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern
Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see
Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per
day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border
and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep
TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year-
over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern
Canada.

High Prices: Strong Pull West
The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also
provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential
has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a
result of this increased pull. For December, the
differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for
a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule
(US$5.10 per MMBtu).

2570,"Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

2571,"El Paso Closer to Acquiring PG&E's Texas Assets

El Paso Energy Corp. is closer to acquiring PG&E Corp.'s Texas gathering and 
liquids businesses for about $840 million in stock and debt after signing a 
consent agreement earlier this week. The deal includes 8,500 miles of natural 
gas transmission pipelines that transport about 2.8 Bcf/d, nine processing 
plants that process 1.5 Bcf/d, and a 7.2 Bcf natural gas storage field. 

PG&E National Energy Group bought the properties about three years ago from 
Valero Energy and Teco for $1.02 billion, but had been unable to turn a 
profit. When it purchased the properties, PG&E paid a premium price to enter 
the west-east gas transportation market. However, since the sale, the basis 
between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston Ship Channel has 
tightened and PG&E could not overcome the roadblocks to become a major 
player. 

The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and 
fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas' major metropolitan areas, large 
industrial load centers and several natural gas trading hubs. The book value 
before the sale to El Paso was estimated to be between $2.5 billion and $2.7 
billion. 

Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the 
liquids game. When the deal was first announced, El Paso said that 70% of the 
cash flow generated by the Texas assets came from stable fee-based activities 
with the balance from processing. El Paso, which is close to completing a 
merger with The Coastal Corp., expects to actively manage the risk on the 
non-fee-based side. 

As part of the normal review process, the consent agreement signed this week 
is subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. El Paso also has 
to finalize a similar agreement with the State of Texas. Once the agreements 
are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth 
quarter.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.

That is not all the second-day ticket can be used anytime, it does not have to be used the next day.

2586,"Guys - Weather permitting in the Texas Panhandle area, I expect to be in 
Friona, TX on Monday, November 20th, on business.  Provided below are some  
items I would have mentioned in the Monday staff meeting:

Plains Farmer's Coop - To date, I have been able to collect approximately 
half of the $500,000 imbalance which Plains Coop owes TW.  I will be meeting 
Charles Hough in Friona (Friona is located 100 miles west of Amarillo) on 
Monday to discuss the payment plan for the remaining imbalance amount in 
additionaI to other general business matters.  I discussed my action plan 
with legal and credit and will request full payment by January 31, 2000, 
latest date.  Effective Febrary 1st,  TW will also include penalty payments 
with any future imbalance outside the +/- 10% tolerance level.  

Pogo Producing - I met recently with John Havard with Pogo. Pogo plans to 
spud a well in Eddy county which is an offset to the EOG operated well 
recently completed and in the process of being attached to TW.   Pogo's well 
will be spud in December with an expected 60 day drill & completion time.  
They have an optimistic expectation of the production being close to the EOG 
well - current initial production of 14 MMcf/d, and have plans for additional 
drilling in the field area.  

CIG - A conference call was held with CIG on Friday to discuss delivery 
performance issues of deliveries to the CIG/Tumbleweed point and the ability 
of them to increase their delivery capacity to Transwestern.    They 
explained that CIG is currently fully subscribed and operating at MAOP along 
the line which provides deliveries to Transwestern, El Paso, NNG and 
SPS/Nichols.  All shippers holding capacity along this line (capacity 200 
MMcf/d)  already have subscribed to long term contracts primarily to El Paso 
and SPS.   Currently they have no operational capability to provide any more 
incremental delivery capabilities to TW at Tumbleweed.  However, they have 
indicated a probable second Raton Expansion project will be announced March 
2001 and have suggested that looping of this southern line could be a 
possible outcome of the project which would provide incremental delivery 
capacity to Transwestern above the current 40 MMcf/d level.  I will be having 
additional discussions with CIG marketing individuals to determine who, 
besides  El Paso and Evergreen, are the primary existing shippers down the 
southern portion of CIG's system in order to potentially get them to realign 
their contract to Transwestern as a primary delivery point.   

Expedition of Contracting Process - Per Kevin's request, I provided him, and 
also discussed, several ideas which would streamline and improve the existing 
contract processing cycle.  The most important and critical recommendation 
was to revise the 3 year old ET&S Discounting Policy which Bill Cordes had 
established for both TW and Northern.  Obtaining approval of even a few 
simple changes I could recommend to the Policy (applicable only to 
Transwestern, not NNG) would have an immediate effect of simplying the 
Officer approval process and would expedite the turn-around time.

2595,"Scott and Ed,

Per a minibook I ran as of 11/30/01 (w/ the one deal corrected that ENA had misbooked), the value due to Enron should be $214,000 (Dec'01 - Dec'03).  This value is PV'd at LIBOR not 10% as requested by the counterparty.  The value does not include attorney's fees requested by Interconn of $1,500.  In addition, Interconn would need to pay the November '01 invoice due to Enron of approximately $1MM.  The final settlement will need to be approved by the Creditor's Committee before Enron can agree to alleviate Interconn of their contractual obligations regardless if the settlement value is agreed upon by both counterparties.  Let me know if the counterparty has any further discrepancies with the value I calculated above.

Thanks,

We have enclosed the most recent drafts of the following ""prototype""
documents:

1.  Letter Agreement for the turbine transaction;
2.  Letter Agreement for the transformer transaction
3.  Limited Liability Company Agreement fur the turbine/transformer
transaction.

These documents were last revised on 12/15/2000.  Since that time, we made a
number of changes to the letter agreement in the InterGen transaction that
you might also wish to consider for the prototype.  These items include (i)
provisions for submission and approval of the facility agreement, (ii)
requirement that the entire purchase price be funded into escrow upon
approval of the facility agreement, (iii) pro-ration of property taxes, (iv)
requirement for liability insurance through date of commercial operation,
and (v) tweaks in the termination language that would provide a right to
terminate, rather than automatic termination.  Let me know if we can be of
any assistance.  Thank you.

David: Here are my comments re the Agency Agreement draft sent last week:
(1) Section 1.27. I would suggest replacing ""in Peoples' sole discretion""
with ""in accordance with Sections 6.1 and 6.2"". This is more consistent
with the intent re changes to the Operating Statement. (2) Section 2.4.
Each one of the new provisions re nominations, (a) 1,2, and 3, ends with a
similar sentence: ""Peoples will confirm these requests as soon as
practicable prior to such nimination deadline and shall enter any
nominations necessary by such nomination deadline."" Should this be more
specific, perhaps something like : ""Peoples will confirm acceptance of
these requests as soon as practicable prior to the nomination deadlione and
shall schedule such nominations prior to the dealdine.""? (The wording for
no. 3 is similar to 1 and 2.)   (3) Section 2.9 (ii) From a regulatory
perspective, I prefer the bracketed language. As I noted regarding the last
draft, a regulator would be concerned with an agreement commiting only to
""commercially reasonable efforts"" re compliance with the GTC, or a Law or
Judgment. (4) Section 2.10. There is a typo in the second line from the
bottom of 8, it's ""remains"" unpaid, not ""remain"". (note that this concept
of a Peoples credit policy is consistent with Peoples' rights re denial of
serivice under Section 8.2 of the GTC, which allows Peoples to refuse
service based on a credit analysis.) (5) Section 5.1. At the time of the
last draft, we discussed an additional representation for Peoples that ""it
has provided MEH with a copy of the G&TC in effect as of the Effective
Date"". This could inserted in 5.1 as (d), with a relettering of current d
and e. (6) Section 7.2 I don't think the second to last sentence will work.
This says that, if Peoples rejects an offered Extended Hub Transactions or
doesn't timely accept, it can't enter into a similar transaction with the
party involved for 6 months. The problem with this is that Peoples must
provided Hub Service under the GTC, except when a ground for refusal stated
in Section 8.2 of the GTC applies. The circumstances described in 7.2 are
not a legitimate ground for refusal. I beleive, however, that we get to the
same place if 7.2 were modified to require that Peoples pay MEH its
percentage of Cumulative Net Revenues in the event that a transaction
similar to one previously rejected for the same party is accepted within 6
mos. after termination of the Agency Agreement.  (7) Section 8.3.  Item
(vi) of the list of functions could be expanded to state: ""assisting in the
pareparation and filing of requests for Governmental Approval in accordance
with Section 10.1 and/or the preparation of FERC reports that are required
in the ordinary course of business and not specifically requested by FERC.""
I wan't sure of the intent re the last phrase of this. Does this mean that
if a Report is specifically requested by FERC, MEH would be paid separetly
for work on the Report? I would have thought that routine review of
regulatory filings and work on reports might all fall into the category
covered by the $50,000 payment, regardless of whether a particular report
is requested. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks"

I'm not certain that an Enron entity will provide a performance guaranty.  I

Is the reference to the ""State"" a reference to the DPUC or CRRA?

As far as I know, the CRRA deal is still in the works, with nothing but a 
confidentiality agreement (with an exclusivity provision) signed, and in my 
opinion should not be presented as being a done deal.

Attached is a proposal from ComEd to complete an Interconnect Feasibility 
Study(IFS) on the Pontiac project site.  I believe that the form of this 
agreement is consistent with the IFS's which we have engaged ComEd to 
complete on the Lincoln Energy Center and the Plano(Yorkville) project.  The 
cost is $50K and the time period is approximately 45 days after ComEd and ENA 
agree on the ""base case"" conditions for the study.

The purpose of this study is to establish the viability and capability of 
interconnecting a generation facility at the ComEd Pontiac substation.  This 
information will provide potential Buyer(s) of the Pontiac site with comfort 
that a project can be built and connected to ComEd's transmission system.  
The east power desk has engaged ComEd to study the transmission availability 
from the Pontiac [and Plano] site.

Please review this agreement and let me know your comments.  If you are

"
2694,"Attached is my red-line of Chris' redline.  I want to make sure we try to 
define what they are going to do for $50,000 and that they let us know early 
if it looks like the costs are going to be higher (I think optioning 
premiums, survey, and landman should cost more like $100,000).  

Another key facet of this deal is that we need the right to force assignment 
of the easement options so we can either build the line to NGPL ourselves, or 
to Nicor only (assuming they'll go for this).  If not, we may want to secure 
the easements to the Nicor point ourselves so we have dual-pipe flexibility.

Finally, we need to make sure they talk to us before approaching any of the 
landowners directly adjacent to our property so we can tell our nearby 
neighbors that they're coming in advance, and so we can let NGPL know who to 
talk to - and more importantly - who not to talk to.  I did not include this 
last point in my mark-up.

The idea here is to fullfill the representations made to our potential site 
buyer that we would secure easements for a gas pipeline.  Since the buyer has 
a large gas marketing affiliate, they may balk at a Nicor-only gas supply 
option (as did Julie Gomez).  Therefore, we feel its prudent to have a dual 
pipe option so we can argue that this is a site value enhancment and that 
NGPL constitutes a highly liquid supply source with pricing that would more 
than amortize the incremental capital cost associated with the added 6 miles 
of pipeline (approximately $4 million).  Scott has indicated that he wants us 
to secure easement options for a gas line and that the buyer is willing to 
pay for 50% of those costs as part of the site purchase.  Prior to signing 
this authorization, we will have gotten Nicor's proposal for a 3 mile line so 
we can weigh the alternatives.  Chris has already initiated contact with 
Nicor (their first offer over the phone was scary).

Kay
"
2706,"Attached is the latest risk policy from Peoples.  It appears that they have 
only made the one change that is highlighted.  However, I would request that 
we all re-read the policy in its entirety to ensure that there are no other 
changes which are not highlighted.  Vlady - here are some thoughts on your 
comments.  

1 - Stop limit size.  I don't think we will be succesful in trying to change 
this at this point.  Peoples Board has been presented with the $10 million.  
As we discussed, there can be no actions taken by the risk committee unless 
unanimous and we can always try to change it once we get going.  
2 - I changed Appendix I to reflect a Stop Loss Trigger limit determination 
period of each fiscal year.
3 - There are no differences in notifications for the 50% and 75% levels.  
The easiest thing to do may be to handle this internally if we want a

Attached is a redline version of Sept 29 letter, and clean copy for
sign/send.  The change involves reference to the contract paragraphs that
deal with corrections, enabling Enron and GE to reach agreement on timing of
performance of corrective work, if we both agreed to a schedule other than
prior to delivery to site.  We recognize that if any of this work has an
impact on your EPC contractor's site work schedule, there maybe other
consequences/remedies, as provided in the contract.

I'll sign and fax.  Hope you all have no objections.

2719,"Attached is the latest risk policy from Peoples.  It appears that they have 
only made the one change that is highlighted.  However, I would request that 
we all re-read the policy in its entirety to ensure that there are no other 
changes which are not highlighted.  Vlady - here are some thoughts on your 
comments.  

1 - Stop limit size.  I don't think we will be succesful in trying to change 
this at this point.  Peoples Board has been presented with the $10 million.  
As we discussed, there can be no actions taken by the risk committee unless 
unanimous and we can always try to change it once we get going.  
2 - I changed Appendix I to reflect a Stop Loss Trigger limit determination 
period of each fiscal year.
3 - There are no differences in notifications for the 50% and 75% levels.  
The easiest thing to do may be to handle this internally if we want a 
different notification at the higher threshhold.  It does not need to be a 
formal part of enovate's policy unless we feel it absolutely necessary.

The ""Governmental Aprroval"" sections work as we discussed: Under Article
10.2, initial effectiveness is contingent on receipt of an ICC Order
acceptable to each party (note-this is an ICC order ""required"" for the
agreement to take effect). The Agreement can terminate under 15.1(e) if a
""Judgment"" (court order, regulatory order etc.) determines that, as a
result of Hub Transactions, Peoples is subject to comprehensive regulation
as a natural gas co. or loses its Hinshaw status. Under 15.2, the Agreement
terminates if it is found void or illegal, or at the option of either party
if found void or illegal in part with frustration  of purpose. The intent
of our wording in these sections, and the related definitions, is to
eliminate the termination right (which was included in Peoples'intial
draft) for a regulatory action, such as an ICC order which adopts an
unfavorable ratemaking treatment for Hub revenues, but does not find the
agreement to be illegal or void. The thought was that, after Peoples
obtains an accpetable intial blessing from the ICC, the risk of some later
regulatory action short of a finding of illegality should rest with Peoples
during the Agreement's term."

ready to go to Peoples as a draft.

"
2725,"I responding to your comments as follows:

Sect. 1.9.  The second to last sentence in the definition of Cumulative Net 
Revenues duplicates part (but not all) of the first sentence of Section 7.2 
with regard to what is included in Cumulative Net Revenue. . . . Perhaps the 
make-up of Cumulative Net Revenue should be covered in just one place or, as 
an alternative, the definition 1.9 could cross-reference 7.2.

You're absolutely right.  The ""and, for purposes of Section 7.1, Section 7.2"" 
reference is a bust.  I've recast the sentence as ""The calculation of 
Cumulative Net Revenues is made expressly subject to Sections 2.10 and 7.2.""

I don't believe the language of Sect. 7.2 regarding the make-up of Cumulative 
Net Revenue is intended to be only ""for purposes of Section 7.1"" as the 
wording of 7.2 suggests.

I included that to avoid any unintended consequences in the event we later 
use ""Cumulative Net Revenue"" in other contexts for which it wouldn't be 
appropriate to include such refund-revenues; but if you believe it's 
confusing, I'll delete the clause.

Sect. 3.3. I would delete part (i) if the last sentence. It would be illegal 
and contrary to this Agreement for MEH (or Peoples) to charge a rate above 
the maximum, so it seems inappropriate to suggest that MEH can collect a fee 
for doing this.

Per our discussion, I agree that it seems inappropriate to contemplate 
knowing violations of federal law.  I'll soften it so it will have a better 
chance of not raising regulatory hackles.

Perhaps we should just make Peoples responsible for all refunds. Let me know 
what you think.

That would be easier, but it seems fair that we should be responsible for 
risks we knowingly or recklessly assume.

Also, 6 lines from the end of 7.2, I think the reference to 7.2 (ii) is a 
typo. I believe it's just 7.2.

It's now changed.

Sect. 18.3. Do we want to include any work related to the Governmental 
Approval as ""ordinary course""?

My inclination is to not include it, so as to avoid arguments with Peoples 
over what's extraordinary and what's ordinary in this context.

As always, I thank you for your help.  DT

One of the first things we do after we execute an option agreement is to get

the same project agreement that has the option agreement.  Are you saying 
that we need two project companies for each project: one for the option 
agreement and one for the interconnect study agreement?  As you may know, it 
has taken 11 months to get to the point in the Midway project from the time 
we executed an interconnect study agreement with FPL to today when we are 
ready to begin negotiating a construction and connection agreement.  Would 
you please clarify the issue for me?

"
2731,"I'm on a 2 hour conference call, so it seems like a good time to write up some of what I know.

I started working on these projects in late May, when Ann Elizabeth went on vacation, so I don't have much history.

Here are the projects which have some activity.

Broward County projects:
These are politically sensitive projects, with what I consider to be a relatively high burn rate on outside legal fees.

I've worked on two of these projects.  

The current active one is called Deerfield Beach. Steve Krimsky is the developer.  We have a land option (Mancini) and a development agreement with the City. The DEP has indicated an indication of its intent to issue an air permit.  Neighboring communities are protesting (quite literally), and the matter has been referred to an administrative law judge, and a hearing is expected in October.  In addition, the communities have sued the City of Deerfield Beach for permitting the development.  We are at the decision point of whether to intervene, which I expect we will.  Richard Sanders is up-to-speed on this, but is not following this.

In late September a sizable payment will be due to the City.  Ben is evaluating whether to drop this one.  If the decision is to continue, he expects to DASH (or I think DASH LITE) the project.  I'm getting estimates on the legal fees to get this and Pompano over the goal line. I estimate the legal fees burn rate to be around $300k per month, with the potential to escalate.  Greenberg Traurig is our outside counsel, and as best I can tell they've been ""managed"" by Steve.  I believe he maintains an office in their office.  The bills have been going to Barbara, so I just interjected myself in the process.  of invoices.

I recently learned that the county is suing to condemn part of the property.  The price they are offering is less than our purchase price, and getting this settled quickly is critical to getting the plat issues so that we can move forward.  Commercially, we are willing to make up the difference, the question being how. We want to extend the option past its current May 01 expiration.  Steve says he thinks that doing a lease would serve commercial purposes better (less initial outlay).

The water contract will be up on the radar screen shortly. We want to use reclaimed water from the county wastewater treatment facility.  That contract will be negotiated with the developer friendly part of the County, but it will need to be approved by the county commissioners.

Speaking of the county, Broward County has enacted a moratorium on power plant development until May 02 (I think that dates right).  Our local lawyers say ""they can't do that"" (that cost us $80k), but they did.  

I have requested that GT prepare an explanation of the steps necessary to get all the approvals, with the overlapping timeframes. This is in connection with the fee estimate request.

Pompano Beach

This project has been announced as cancelled, but there are rumblings of a revival.


Certosa Holdings

This project was cancelled, but ITS BACK.  We will let the balance sheet unfriendly option expire, and will enter into a balance sheet friendly option.  The land owner is a single asset company owned by a Cuban national living in Venezuela.  It was formerly a land fill, and needs to be reclaimed, the cost of which exceeds the value of the land.

There are outstanding zoning issues on this one.  We tried to get around the local zoning board with a technical argument, but now they are enacting an ordinance which will require it.  Ben's current plans are to get the new option and get this in shape to mothball until the tide turns.

Greg Krause is the developer.  He is fine to work with.

Homestead.

I think this is new.  We are negotiating an option. Very young project as best I can tell.

Midway

This one is fairly far along, and I'm not aware of any significant permitting/approval issues.  We are finishing up a property owner's association agreement, and working on an interconnect agreement.  We will need a water supply agreement in the near future. Another Greg Krause deal.

I'm also working with Ben on the sell of the project to TECO (same lawyer as the last TECO deal I worked on).  We have a LOI and draft purchase contract which is going out to TECO this week.  I expect that I can still support this one since it is getting to the end.

This gives an overview of what I've been working on in the past couple of weeks.

2744,"Hi there,

I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.

Here are some questions/comments:

I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations. =
=20
I'm not yet clear as to what the agency language will look like, and what=
=20
rights we need/want to change (i) the identity of the agent (ii) the role o=
f=20
the agent (iii) whether the agency can be terminated.  I'm just not that=20
familiar with the structure yet, but if I can get that information, I'll wo=
rk=20

I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of ""substantially=20
similiar"" comparison.  Just easier to decipher.

Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.

I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating=20
standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they=
=20
can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.

I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by t=
he=20
assignee in the past 5 years.  I also think 3 years is a bit much on audite=
d=20
financials, but I didn't comment there.

I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to=20
own/operate the plant.  I've just bracketed the langauge and added=20
""construct"", since I don't know if this point has already been agreed.

2746,"Attached is the latest markup on the warranty language which GE is now 
reviewing.  I also have a few comments from John Rigby which may be worth 
adding but I suggest we hold off until we discuss the warranty language with 
GE next week.

I also spoke to Steve Swift who indicated that he would Email to Sheila what 
has been agreed to on indemnity, LOL, ect. and what we intend to insert into 
the Arcos contract.  FYI I do not intend to use the ""end world hunger"" 
warranty language in the Arcos contract as I want GE back-to-back on what we 
have signed up to with the owner under the EPC contract.

Regards,

Scott

2748,"One of the World Hunger issues is that GE does  not want Enron to be able to 
issue a unilateral change order which would impact the manufacturing schedule.

We have the same issue in the Arcos Power Island deal.  

Following is what I intend to propose to solve the Arcos problem and might 
work  for World Hunger:


"" Purchaser acknowledges taht Seller's ability to accomodate changes in 
manufacturing scope in a timely or cost effective manner diminish as Seller 
gets further along into the manufacturing process, and after a point changes 
can only be made after assembly completion or in the field without adversely 
affecting Seller's manufacturing obligations to other clients (a ""Client 
Impact"").  Where such a Client Impact circumstance exists, Seller shall 
identify such constraints to Purchaser in its proposal submitted pursuant to 
Clause 17.2.(b) [time and cost estimate to accomodate the Change 
Order-Variation Order], which Purchaser shall take into account in evaluating 
Seller's proposed cost and time changes arising out of such Variation scope 
change. ""




I would appreciate your thoughts as to whether this works for us in the World 
Hunger document-  I do  not want to propose for Arcos if it gives you great 
difficultly for World Hunger.


 "
2749,"Attached is a first cut at the Status of the items we discussed at our
meetings last week in Houston.

Our common target is to get this contract review done by labor day so I will

2751,"John:
The changes I suggested on the watercraft wording are still being reviewed=
=20
for completeness. I think what I gave you will work for most situations whe=

y=20
situation that we could be involved in. We may need to expand our wording=
=20
accordingly.

Likewise, your question on giving to the turbine venders the waiver of=20

If you need to have some language in the agreement, I would recommend that =

=20
the insurance and begin placing it, we can then determine if the underwrite=

2765,"Hi guys! Hope yall are doing well. We are enjoying a beautiful day here. Are
yall enjoying having your college-aged children home?

My question is this: I think we are going to give Mama a garage door opener
for her Christmas present. Not sentimental, but I think once it's in and she
uses it, she'll like it. ANYWAY, would anyone like to pitch in toward the
installation, or, Mike, would you and Mac want to install it for her for
your present?

Just asking, if yall aren't interested, that's cool. We can always go ahead
and pay for installation or Bobby can come up and install it sometime in
January.

But, I thought I would ask, just in case you were interested. Yall are
probably way ahead of us and have finished shopping anyway. Kay, you've
already given her your present haven't you?

Also, Mama has mentioned that we need to try to schedule a Monday or Friday
in January to all get together and take care of some stuff up there. Her
will among other things I think. Anyway, any time that is bad or good for
anyone. Bobby will be out of town I think the 2nd week or so of January so I
think I would prefer to do it later. Let me know what dates are good/bad and
we can see what we come up with.

One other thing. Mike, do you know if we ever gave Kelli a birthday present?
I know I gave Michael and Paige something, and Mac's will come with the
Christmas stuff. Let me know if you know. I'm thinking I didn't do anything.

Okay, talk to yall later.

2838,"Duke Energy, Environmentalists Strike Deal over California Plant 
Tom Knudson 

May. 16, 2001 
Knight Ridder Tribune Business News - KRTBN 
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM) 

Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to expand its Moss 
Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall, documents show four 
environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant. The four 
signed an agreement not to ""participate in any lawsuit (or) regulatory 
challenge"" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial 
concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental ""monitoring and research."" 

Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been 
difficult. But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and 
permit new energy sources, some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that 
money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor 
of economic development.

Environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their 
concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it, 
especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and 
Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.

So they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement 
with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact on 
the marine environment.

Other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach.

Duke Energy's efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in 
mitigation payments to environmental and other groups, including:

$7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plant's use of 
seawater.

$425,000 to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor 
heated seawater discharge in the ocean.

$1 million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to 
monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores, the 
Center for Marine Conservation, the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter 
Project.

$100,000 to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for 
injured animals onto power plant property.

$3.4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over 20 years for 
infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community.

$100,000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in 
Moss Landing.

$60,000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle 
Trail. If approved, Duke would provide an additional $250,000 endowment to 
maintain the trail.

""It is very disheartening,"" said Carolyn Nielson, a retired teacher who along 
with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider 
an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system.

""These environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the 
attorneys,"" said Nielson, who has taken her case to the State Water Resources 
Control Board. ""We could have been much more successful with their help. But 
there wouldn't have been any financial reward in it for them.""

Such criticisms are off-base, according to Warner Chabot, regional director 
for the Center for Marine Conservation, a national environmental group that 
was among those to sign the deal. He said environmentalists got the best deal 
possible in the current energy climate.

""Look at what's happening with power plant approvals in California right 
now,"" said Chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy sources 
on line.

The Moss Landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in 
2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy 
expansion plan.

No money will go to the four environmental groups -- the Center for Marine 
Conservation, along with Save Our Shores, Friends of the Sea Otter and the 
Otter Project. It will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000 
each, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, a nonprofit organization that 
helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research.

Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. He said 
the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough, a 
biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey 
Bay.

""Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation,"" he said. ""Not a 
penny comes to me.""

Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been 
stirred by a handful of people.

""It's a million dollars worth of water quality studies,"" said Duke spokesman 
Tom Williams. ""Our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. It was 
designed to help increase people's comfort level where there wasn't a comfort 
level.""

The $1 million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more than 
$12 million in Duke payments to civil, government and environmental groups in 
connection with the plant modernization.

The heftiest award -- $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a 
nonprofit environmental organization -- was negotiated by state agencies to 
""mitigate"" environmental impacts of the plant.

Formed in 1982, the slough foundation exists to promote ""the wise use and 
conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands,"" its Web site says. 
However, some environmentalists say the state-approved mitigation plan is 
inadequate.

""If you want to say, 'Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money?' I would 
say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board 
for the price of mitigation,"" Chabot said. ""The agencies got bought off 
cheap. And the environment got taken to the cleaners.""

Duke's Williams strongly disagreed. Environmental mitigation ""must be based 
on science, not on buying anybody off,"" he said. ""That is inappropriate, and 
we would not participate in that.

""That suggestion is offensive to us. And it should be offensive to any 
environmentalist.""

Bob Haussler, head of the Energy Commission's environmental protection 
office, said the mitigation plan is biologically sound. ""We are confident it 
will improve the slough ecosystem,"" he said.

Madeline Clark, a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway -- a 
citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects -- called the 
recipients of Duke's payments a ""shopping list"" of government agencies, 
environmental groups and civic organizations. She was particularly critical 
of the $1 million deal with environmental groups.

""You know what bothers me?"" Clark said. ""Environmental groups get tons of 
donations. Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment. If a big 
corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off, I have a real problem 
with that.""

Construction began in November on Duke's project to add 1,060 megawatts of 
natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant, purchased 
from PG&E in 1998.

If the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for 
more than 30 percent of all new generation in California in 2002.

""This is a big deal,"" said Williams, the Duke spokesman. ""It will be the 
largest plant in California. If that plant is delayed a month or two, we lose 
the summer of 2002. And that affects not only Duke Energy, but the state of 
California.""

Opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling system, 
which will pump about 1.2 billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss 
Landing Harbor. Such pumping, they say, will degrade Elkhorn Slough. They 
argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that re-circulate 
water.

""Basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the 
harbor and slough, run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with 
much of the marine life cooked and dead,"" said Steve Shimek, executive 
director of the Otter Project.

For Shimek and other environmentalists, scientific studies commissioned by 
Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the 
plant's impact on the environment.

""There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing 
harm to the environment,"" said Vicki Nichols, executive director of Save Our 
Shores. ""We felt we didn't have strong standing to sue.""

Instead, the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial 
payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project.

The process ""gave me tremendous pause and great concern,"" Nichols said. ""I 
knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong 
thing.""

She was right.

""As far as I'm concerned, with the price-gouging going on by the energy 
wholesalers, they are just receiving stolen goods,"" said Clark, of the 
citizens group.

Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy 
approached Gov. Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions 
if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator.

Chabot, with the Center for Marine Conservation, discouraged any comparison 
between the two offers, calling it ""grossly unfair and inaccurate.""

Regardless of what was intended with the payments, Nielson said they stain 
the process. ""It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical,"" she 
said.

Shimek took a different view. ""We convinced Duke to spend $1 million toward 
monitoring that, frankly, five years from now could very well come back to 
haunt them,"" he said.

""Did we do the right thing? I have no idea. Did we try our best? Yes, we 
did.""

2842,"Hi Dave,

I was wondering if you have had a chance to look over the draft facility 
agreement? We would like to make some progress on the form this week.  In 
fact, you may hear (or have heard) directly from Dale Rasmussen, who is an 
Enron lawyer supporting one of the projects at issue.

There are also some change order type changes which need to be captured in 
words and made a part of the individual facility agreements, or integrated as 
changes to these agreements.

Thanks for your assistance,

2843,"I've heard of some of the stuff.  These items should be dealt with in the 
facility agreements for the individual projects.  ABB has had a form  of this 
agreement to comment on for a while, but we haven't heard anything.  

Hope this helps a little.

2844,Looks ok to me.

2846,"Question:

2847,"The attached is a letter agreement reflecting the resolution of certain

everybody sign on the dotted line, including NEPCO, EEPC and my dog Jack.

2848,"Al,

Each project must have its own break out contract - that's the deal struck 
with GE and with the lenders.  There will be no change orders to the master 
contract relating to specific projects.  The break out contract must be 
entered into ""as soon as practicable"". This appproach has been taken with 
Austin, LV Co Gen, and ESA, and all of those contracts are just about 
finished.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Sheila also has a good 
understanding of the structure.

Kay







"
2849,"Barbara/Jeff:

In the  TurboPark world there will be certain impacts on how power projects 
involving physical capacity are structured and implemented.  I know some (but 
not all) of it.  I can say that it is fairly easy to bust the structure and 
wind up with assets on the balance sheet, and that the commercial folks 
aren't always (or even usually) sensitive to the issues.  Maybe after the 
first of the year those group members who will be working on the power 
origination and development side could get briefed by the finance and 
accounting folks.

Kay"
2850,"Due to Rose being out of town, I thought I would respond to a question 
concerning giving notice to WestLB, and the preparation of the assignment and 
assumption agreement.

The giving of written notice to WestLB may result in the equipment being 
subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet.  If there is a subsequent 
problem in closing, the equipment is tainted.  I believe Enron has 
coordinated this with WestLB, so that the notice period can be shortened 
until there is a certainty of closing.

A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I 
will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this 
transaction.

We will have a couple of changes in the GE consent and assignment agreement, 
based on changes requested by WestLB in connection with the TurboPark 
transaction.    I'll make the changes.

Hope this information is helpful.

2877,"Unless the first option expires (and the original premium is expensed), you 
add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage.  
If we can't beat the percentage game, we can have the land on the balance 
sheet and that won't put the entire project on it.  Don't ask me to splain 
that, because I can't.  If the land is going to be on the balance sheet, you 
would think that it would be better to have $1.3 on than $4.2.  However, one 
thing I don't know (haven't asked) is what the environmental restrictions are 
with our financing vehicle.  I don't know if the land has to be clean before 
it can go into the vehicle.  I can ask.  If it is required to be clean, then 
you may be back to the $4.2 anyway.

upset because you comment on how I do things (I don't even try to fold

if I say something about how you do something, you get upset and say you

2888,"
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

The artwork Blue Note is $4,500 framed like the previous artwork you saw here 
but if you choose a more expensive frame like the one you saw on the Matisse, 
the framed price would also increase.? I will speak to the owner tomorrow 
about price negotiations on your behalf.? Before I sit down with him, where 
do you stand on price?? It is important I have this information, so I can 
take this to the owner on your behalf. 

I must mention we stand behind all our artworks. All artworks are 
authenticated and qualified with a condition report.? In fact, each artwork 
comes with an authenticity signed by the owner.? Also if you have any 
questions you are always welcome to speak to the owner or our Director of

Thought I would drop you a note to see how you are
doing.  I haven't heard from you for ages and was
wondering what you are up to.

If Beth is down for Stampeed say Hi to her for me.

We are slowly getting things sorted out and under
control around here.  We have all of the major inside
projects done and Ron is just about finished putting
up the fence.  This is good as they have just posted a
caution bear in the area sign on the mailboxes.  The
fence should keep them away from the house, I hope.

I sent pictures of the place to your mum so reminde
her to show them to you the next time you see her.  I
really like the place.  Lots of work to keep me busy
and out of trouble but not as much work as the house
and yard in Calgary.

Rons mum coming for a visit on 18 July.  Will take her
out and about in the Yukon and a couple of places in
Alaska.  I am looking forward to going on a tour
again.

Well should run for now.  All is well with me.  Going
to the gym 3 days a week and am working on quitting
smoking, again.

Lots of Love

2941,"NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Nov 20, 1:53 PM
Reliant Unveils Natural Gas Index, Risk Management Tools 
Reliant Energy Wholesale Group unveiled a new natural gas index and associated financial risk management instrument, designed to enable natural gas traders to better hedge risk for their companies and portfolio clients during the heating season. The Weather-Sensitive Gas Load Index (WGLI) measures current and forecasted residential and commercial natural gas consumption. To work with the index, Reliant has developed a financial instrument tailored for gas traders, called the WGLI Swap. 
WGLI is based on the weighted sum of heating-degree-days in four areas: Chicago, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Philadelphia and Sacramento. A heating-degree-day is recorded when the average temperature falls below 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and it is assumed that customers of natural gas companies then begin using their residential furnaces and commercial heating systems. 
""The index captures more than 90% of the variation in residential and commercial gas load,"" said Pat Strange, senior vice president of Reliant's Gas Trading. ""Using this index, weather forecasts can be translated immediately into residential and commercial consumption forecasts. Inputs to the index formula are publicly available, and the index is relatively simple to calculate. Calculations can be made as needed on a weekly, monthly or seasonal basis."" 
Regional gas load indices are also available for the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions. 
WGLI is set to equal 100 for a typical week in the heating season (a typical week represents the weekly average for the last 10 heating seasons). For example, a WGLI value of 110 indicates residential and commercial gas usage is 10% higher than a typical week; conversely, a WGLI of 90 indicates that residential and commercial gas consumption is 10% lower. 
Based on WGLI, Reliant designed a standardized financial derivative, the weekly WGLI Swap. The contract is designed to mirror weekly changes in residential and commercial gas load. Beginning with the upcoming heating season, Reliant and other corporations said they are committed to making markets in WGLI and Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regional gas load indices weekly Swaps. The WGLI swaps may be used to enhance the risk/reward profile of a trader's gas portfolio, and traders can use it to hedge volume risks embedded in their trading positions.

	Team,
	I'm not sure what the latest discussions you've had since our last meeting, but I need to get this 
	concept outlined and in the hands of my customer.  They are making their decision any day now 
	and I believe this structure will add to the value of our Compression Service and reduce our 
	dependence on the minimum load factor.  

	I've attached a basic outline as I see it.  Please review or we will discuss at our 3:00 meeting today.
	I would like to define or understand our (Enron's) wish list as well as a relative value at a minimum.  
	I need to get the specifics to my customer tomorrow since it's not going to happen today.

Gerald,
Since the agreements with Hubbard were executed by ENA (and not ECS)
is there some assignment from ENA to ECS that we should or need to look
at for post-petition business?  
 
Sounds like they are planning to not pay the delinquent bills but to make 
assurances for the billing going forward.  This is a BIG deal to these small
Cooperatives that we typically work with.  Our load generally represents a 
very large percentage of their total business and they have wholesale providers
that they have to pay.  A couple of our monthly bills could put these guys
into financial distress themselves.  
 
I need to find and read throught the contract with Midland Power before this
gets too far down the road.  I'm out today (Monday) and tomorrow dealing

Subject: FWD: Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones

How true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones

Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that
men should take a look at their beer consumption,
considering the results of a recent analysis that
revealed the presence of female hormones in beer. The
theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into
women.

To test the finding, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer
each.  It was then observed that 100% of the men
gained weight, talked excessively without making
sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed
to think rationally, argued over nothing,
and refused to apologize when wrong.

No further testing is planned.

Sorry for the delay but Gerald and I were out all of last week and returned 
from vacation today.  

My understanding of the process is the counterparty applies for 
access/password with the password application....he's approved and given an 
USERID and password....and then when he accesses the site for the 1st time, 
the software will route him to the OUA which he must agree to on-line before 
he is allowed to carry out operations/nominations through the website.  On 
subsequent visits to the site the software will recognize that the 
Counterparty has previously agreed to the OUA and will not route him 
automatically to the agreement.  

In response to your questions:
(1) The check verification option (exchange or view access) has been deleted 
from the password application
(2) My understanding was that the site would be used only by current HPL 
customers with existing contracts, if that's not the case we need to tweak 
the agreement.
(3) The formatting errors have been corrected.

from the HPL South Texas Joint Venture Pipeline System and the Rio Nogales 
Power Plant located near Seguin, Texas.  The interconnect will be built on 
the South Texas System near the city of Prarie Lea.  

The power plant is presently in construction.  The plant owners will build a 
new pipeline to connect to the HPL system.  The new pipeline is anticipated 
to commence construction around June 1, 2001.  Under the Interconnect 
Agreement HPL will, at its expense, install the hot tap and valve and then be 
reimbursed for its actual expenses.  Expenses are estimated to be less than 
$150,000.

A Guaranty Agreement has concurrently been executed between HPL and 
Constellation Power, Inc.   This agreement by the parent of Rio Nogales Power 
Project, L.P. provides a corporate guaranty for payment of the work by HPL up 
to $300,000.  With receipt of the executed Guaranty, Facility Planning and 
Enginneering are released to recommence discussions with Rio Nogales and 
thier pipeline constructor, Pinnacle, to finalize details of the 
interconnection.

In recognition of the prospective close between HPL and AEP, HPL will attempt 
to have the work performed after the close.  If the currently anticipated 
close date of June 1st occurs, this schedule should not be a problem.  If the 
work can be scheduled after close, the receivable to HPL should be 
straightforward and not require any special handling.  I therefore request 
that Jim Haden and Bob Camp coordinate with me regarding the schedule for the 
work.

I would also request that Ken Kaase provide our Joint Venture Partner 
notification of the interconnection agreement or whatever advice is required 
under the JV Agreement.  Ken, I will provide you whatever details are needed 
for this purpose.

The interconnect is located on the system that would deliver future volumes 
to the City of San Antonio should HPL be sucessful in negotiating such a 
contract.  It is also the system that could service the new Austin peakers 
either through new pipe or through a third party transport.  To date, there 
is no gas sales or transportation agreement with Rio Nogales.  Because of the 
current state of hydraulics on this system, and the multiple potential loads, 
all  interested individuals need to be cognizant of a need to coordinate and 
plan for handling these prospective loads towards maximizing the benefit of 
the asset .

Please advise if there are any questions or concerns."

management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and

I suggest that if we're unable to rent from either Avis or National, that we 
elect the same levels of insurance coverage under the rental agreement with 
Enterprise as we have negotiated in the corporate contracts.

As information, here is the summary of the insurance provided under the 
corporate rental car agreements 
(this can be found at the intranet site http://travel.enron.com/accomm.html)


Car Rental Contracts

Rental car contracts for January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2000 have been 
awarded to:

National Car Rental and Avis Rent A Car System, Inc.

When you rent a vehicle from National or Avis under the Contract, the daily 
rental rate includes two kinds of insurance: 
L/DW(Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision 
on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for and damage 
to it. 
Liability - This covers persons and property outside the rental vehicle. For 
both National and Avis, the coverage is $100,000 per person/$300,000 per 
occurrence, 
and $50,000 for property damage. 

These coverage's only apply when the vehicle is rented at the contract rate 
using the following state contract identifier numbers: 

National - 5000838
Avis - A288200

3015,"Gerald:

Jere Bates asked that I comment on your redline of the confidentiality
agreement that I helped draft.  My comments are as follows:

1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning the
obligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to striking
this.  The information is not to be used at any time other than for the
purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to
acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use
information it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believe
that language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with the
language in the last sentence of Section 5 as well.

2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many
damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct
or ordinary, but rather consequential.  In addition, the right to recover
punitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect against
blatant disregard for the terms of the agreement.  We also believe that we
should have three years to commence an action after termination.

3.  Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate since
Tri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach and
should have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it is
familiar with.

Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response.  We are open
to discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position is
reasonable and appropriate.

3025,"It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if

the commercial staff.   The program covers  the legal implications of various 
activities of our commercial team -- particularly as they interact with

manipulation that might affect our trading and marketing activities.

The two hour training sessions will be  held at the Doubletree, in the 
Dezavala Room on the second floor at the listed times.   Please feel free to

I had a great time last night--hopefully we can get together again sometime!  
It's nice to get out of the house and away from my studying.  I'm getting the 
pictures put on a CD tomorrow, but will only be sending them out to a select 
few.  And, of course, only the ones I approve of!  I don't want them 
circulating around the office too much--I try to keep my outside life 
separate from work as much as possible, ya know??

So, keep an eye out--you may be getting an e-mail over the weekend.........

3043,"I sm preparing to open up a bidding activity for the subject Pipeline which 
is approximately four miles of 12"" pipe under account # 3224.  The nbv is 
$18,901.

I have dusted off my list of salvage bidders and under separate cover will 
publish these seeking additions or deletions from any of you who care to 
contribute.  ;I am assuming that this pipe is not viably operating and would 
appreciate any information in this regard if I am incorrect.  

As for now, I would like a sample Purchase and Sale Agreement and a 
Confidentiality Agreement that I may use with my solicitations.  This would 
include some type of alignment sheet depicting the pipe and its legal 
description, etc.  You are all seasoned in knowing what level of data I need 
at this stage of the offer.

I already have at least one interested party in this and would like to move 
forward as soon as possible to get this on the table for bids.  I would 
appreciate receiving the necessary materials by October 31, or information of 
how I can contribute to this activity.  Also, please let me know if there is 
someone else I should copy on this.

Thank you in advance for your assistance in this endeavor."
3044,"Joan, Gerald;

What is the game plan for November nominations?  Do we want to go through
the same deal as before and nominate on NWPL, get rejected, and renominate
on Questar?  Or, do we want to nominate on Questar and include a statement
that we are nominating on Questar only because of last month's ordeal?

Tom Brown and Wildhorse are supposed to close today - if they didn't get
their late last Friday.

3050,"Dear Gerald,

I'm surprised you were moving at all the day after the party! I'm not to
sure on the Tequila/Cranberry mix either but as you say - it's always good
to try new things, I just wouldn't advise trying it again that's all!  I had
a good time too, wasn't that drunk either by the end which is a bit of an
unusual occurrence for me.
This past weekend we had a party put on by the law school so we went to that
Friday night and then shopped til we dropped on Saturday - my flat mate has
been having a bit of a hard time so I gave her a day of Sophie Therapy - she
seems a lot more relaxed now - I hope it will last. Saturday I also caught a
cold so I've been feeling pretty rough the last couple of days although I
think it's gradually going now so fingers-crossed I'll be okay to party hard
this weekend  - although I've no plans as yet.
Oh, I haven't heard of that band by the way but it sounds good anyway, and
yes I do like yorkshire puddings - how can anyone not - obviously you should
have the full compliment of beef, roast potatoes and vegetables and gravy
(although I'll gladly do without the beef) but they're gorgeous - don't you
think? Hmm.
Anyway, better get on with some work,
have a good week, whatever you're doing, any interesting deals?
Sophie.

3052,"Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an

this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming 
it is our standard form.  I will check this.

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that 
this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  

Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities?

something, but I will take it in a humorous manner.

3076,"Attached is a draft for your review.  Please review and lets discuss any 
comments.

  After re-reading the purchase and gathering agreement, I think the 
amendments should work in their present form.  The 2,500 Western gas needs to 
be noted as an exception on Exhibits A of both Agreements.   Exception should 
read ""Up to the first 2,500 mmbtu/day of production from the Caballo Area 
shall be delivered to Western.... with ENA  (or EMS as applicable for the 
agreement) receiving all volumes in excess of such 2,500 mmbtu/day.  Any 
decline in the Caballo Area production shall apply ratably between Western's 
2,500 mmbtu/day and ENA's (or EMS as applicable for the agreement) production 
levels.""

eateries with captains of industry tonight.  However, Eric and I were kicking 
around a possible road trip to the beautiful island of Galveston this 
weekend.  Saturday or Sunday? Think that nice friend of yours, Willis, might 
be interested? 

Please respond appropriately with your level of interest!  Just to anticipate 
the tone of your response, I will go ahead and call you a ""Smart Ass"" right 
now.

"
3084,"RFP,   I had a good time also.  The bands were interesting though.  I bet 
that dude in the helmet sweated his ass off during the performance.  

The date was actually  her call.  We are meeting some of her friends out for 
dinner and drinks and then some sweet sweet love.  Seriously, this girl is 
cool and a lot of fun.  Should be a good time.  Of course I am assuming that 
the date is still on.  In my clear thinking state last night when I left Rudz 
(a la 1 pm) I called her and woke her up.   I really have no idea what I said 
to her.  She may not be speaking to me anymore.

What was with Willis last night?  No show!

Let's circle the wagons this afternoon to discuss Galveston.






"
3085,"I'm sorry.  Eric and I aren't speaking at the moment due to creative 
differences.  I want only the orange M&M's removed from our dressing room and 
he wants only the brown ones removed.

3088,"Forgot to put you on the original distribution.

"
3089,"Sounds like a good trip if there are spaces available.  I think our dive 
captain is checking availability.  Of course our dive captain is also 
hesitant about being swallowed whole by a Whale Shark.  I told him that with 
a house to remodel that would probably be a blessing.

Let us know what your schedule is.  See if we can't hook up Thursday or 
Friday for lunch.  I open and I am sure Nacious E would be too.






"
3090,"True.  Especially after I cut E's fat plump rump roast with my dive knife to 
chum the waters a little.  Let's shoot for Friday for lunch.  Maybe I go back 
to work after that or maybe I don't.  No other three Czech brothers can 
cruise so successfully in tight slacks!

Things are going well with little Cynthia.  She is really fun and easy to 
talk to.  I am not sure what my intentions are right now but we enjoy each 
others company.

3108,"Heidi,  I have reviewed the contracts and the amendments and the following is 
their status:

 1.  Contract Number 96006959 (012-41991-02-004)  Amended April 1, 1999

  Term:  Month to Month and may be terminated by either party with 10 days 
written notice prior to end of the month (But see rate section below)

  Rate:  Agreement was amended on April 1, 1999 to put a flat rate of $0.085 
for all receipts at Thompsonville (Meter #6351) through March 31,   2006 
(This language would override the month to month term)  No other Points of 
Receipt are allowed under this contract.

  Note:  Prior to the Amendment on April 1, 1999, the $0.01 fee escalator was 
still in effect for any volumes moved under this contract prior to the   
Amendment.  If the escalator wasn't assessed during that time, it should have 
been.  This escalator would have applied to all receipts and    fees on the 
original Exhibit A to the contract.

3131,"Dave,  Attached is a rough draft of the letter we discussed.  The right to 
match option is a little less drastic than the ""saving sharing"" we 
discussed.  The savings sharing is a little more problematic to enforce.  We 
can discuss though, if that is really the way you want to go.  Please review

open season for capacity release, but it may cause confusion so probably to 
remove it.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

=======================================

Prologue

Should I do it or not?  This was a question that had to be answered.....and soon.  This question had been lurking in the back of my mind since I'd already seen some gnarly bike crashes before and I've heard all the nasty stories about them.  So I was basically reluctant to do so, but I was obviously curious about it and so I had mixed feeling altogether.  I jumped on the internet for some perspective and discovered the pros and cons.  I figured, if I did happen to be involved in a pile-up, then I'd be sorry.  In the end, I did it.  In the tradition of cycling, I decided to shave my legs!

Day One - 100 miles

My alarm sounded off at 4:30 and I jumped out of bed, quickly dressed, and threw my gear into my Jeep and hit the road. The MS150 ride started at 7am.  And with 10,000 riders participating, my goal was to avoid as much traffic as possible.  Thankfully, the team I rode with (Sun & Ski Sport) started in the number two position.  bp, the corporate sponsor, started off the race.  It should be noted that my ride started at Tully Stadium (Dairy Ashford/I-10) as opposed to Rhodes Stadium (located in Katy) and so an extra 15 miles were immediately tacked on.

From my POV, this day's ride was no different from any other I did in the preceding weeks other than the fact that it was longer by about 40 miles.  After the start and once the crowd thinned out, I got into my groove (after pulling over for a quick relief stop) and stayed within my own and kept a moderate speed with a high cadence.  The sun was above the clouds, but while en route a large, dark menacing cloud seemed to head my direction, but thankfully it amounted to nothing and the cloud cover remained most of the day.

I admit, my goal was to get to LaGrange as soon as possible without exerting too much energy early on.  In order to do this, I avoided the official rest-stops as much as possible.  When I did pull in for a snack or to refill my CamelBack with water, it was a long wait as there were a few hundred people at each stop.  At my first stop, I misplaced my cyclometer.  I removed it from my bike so that no one would steal it.  I got off my bike, stretched my legs, and loaded up on liquids and oranges.  On my way back to my bike, I noticed my cyclometer was neither in my hand nor in my jersey.  ****!  So I went back to the food table and asked the volunteers if they'd seen it (they had not), and I looked in the nearby trashcans.  No luck.  Now I was disappointed but I put it behind me.  On my way back to my bike, I SAW IT ON THE GROUND.  Whew!  So back on the road.

After a few more rest stops (to stretch and liquid-load) and even more roadside relief stops, I arrived in Bellville for lunch.  With my goal in mind, I quickly ate and hit the road again.  The ride became more scenic but my body began to get restless, namely my back, neck and rear end.  The sun broke the through the clouds and I began to sweat profusely.  To wipe away the sweat I used my ""pedal partner"" bandana.  My partner is someone named Kathryn who has MS.  The point of the program is to get to know this person and let them know that I was able to do what they could not because of the disease.

There were lots of spectators in LaGrange, and the campsite was not far the from city limits' edge.  The crowds lined the road for 1/2 a mile.  After I arrived at 2:40, I checked in my bike, went to the Sun & Ski team tent, got my clothes, took a cool shower (this was awesome), ate lunch, and waited for a massage.  I was obviously tired and tried to get a nap in but, with the sun up, it was difficult to do.  Eventually, I pulled The Sun Also Rises from my bag and began to read randomly (it's one of my favorite books).  I woke up an hour later feeling much better.  

By this time, it's around 7 o'clock and the sun is still up, so I wandered the campgrounds, ate some more, and visited friends on other teams.  Once the DJ closed shop and the staff began to make room for people to sleep, I setup camp in a quiet corner of the tent, stretched as much as possible and went to sleep.

My times on this day:  3'18"" from Houston to Bellville, 23"" for lunch, 3'52"" from Bellville to LaGrange.  Total time = 7'34""

Day Two - 80 miles

No alarm was necessary on this day because the portable generators all seemed to fire up around the same time - 4:30.  It was hard to get out of bed but I eventually did.  I had to load my gear, fill my CamelBack, stretch, and wait in line for the start.  By 6:30 I was at the back of the pack and I did not like this.  From this vantage, I would not leave Bellville until after 8 o'clock.  I followed a misfit gang that tried to go another route to exit the campgrounds, but while doing so a ""pppsssttt"" sound came from my rear tire. That sounds means only one thing - a flat tire.  ****!  I went to the repair tent and found that the tire was sliced...either the tire was damaged or I walked over some glass.  The repair line was short and $29 was the damage for a new tube and tire.  On the bright side, I was closer to the start and got out on the road much earlier than I anticipated.

Overall, my body wasn't too tired and my legs felt okay.  The night before I stretched frequently, took gobs of Advil, and rested as much as possible.  I feared day two the most because word was out that the route had lots of hills and 80 miles is no easy task.  I deliberately started off slow just to get the blood flowing and to loosen up the muscles.  10 miles had past and I was fine.  I had to decide by mile 25 whether to go the hilly route (Bastrop State Park) or bypass it entirely.  

I talked to a few riders about it and chose to do the hills.  At mile 25 was the entrance to the park and a rest area.  I loaded up on liquids and decided to get a quick massage at the medical tent.  A rider told me he did this the day before and felt much better afterwards.  And so I was on the park course and the hills were short and steep.  The reward for climbing these hill was a well-deserved coast on the other side.  Then another hill.  And another...et cetera.  This was the case for about 10 miles.  The last hill was the most difficult.  The burn in my thighs and rear was more evident but I kept going.  My goal for this segment was to not stop.  Many others did but I went to my lowest gear and grinded it out.  After the last hill was the home stretch.  Lunch was minutes away at Bastrop H.S.

I was psychologically confident at this point since I only had 40 miles left and the hard part was behind me.  Upon immediate (and post-race reflection, I determined that the ride through the state park was the best part of the ride.  It had everything - shade, cooler air, no wind, hills, and a thinner road in which to maneuver.  It required me to focus, relax, and strategize on how to approach each hill.  Although I consider myself a beginner biker, I think I graduated to the intermediate level after than experience.

I still felt okay after the hills since I stretched quite well during lunch.  But I was back on the road because Austin was not going to get any closer with me staying in LaGrange.  I stopped at one rest area and pulled over another time.  Soon afterward, the ""Austin 24"" was in sight.  Only 24 more miles!  I was at my own pace when a rather large peloton passed by.  I decided to get on-board and kept with it for about 8 miles.  They were pedaling faster than I could keep up and I admit it took a lot out of me.  I knew the finish was near but my legs began to falter.

The final 5 miles was made up of more hills but it was the final stretch.  Many bikers were in their lowest gear including myself.  The path narrowed to about 8' since we were in the city and this made for dangerous conditions on the hills.  There is always a reckless biker who is interested in speed only and, unfortunately there was one such person near me who would pass me on the downhill at high speed, but I would pass him on the uphill.  Because of him, I nearly had a spill.  He came a little too close on a downhill.  We exchanged a few words and I deliberately slowed to let him pass.  Jerk!

And the crowds were there in Austin cheering us on.  One more dip and hill and the finish line was near.  Could this be the end?  It was.  I took my final picture of the finish line and was thankful that I finished.  I rarely go to Austin but when I do, it's on a bike.  Funny, huh?

Now I'm hungry, very hungry but I need to check in at the Sun & Ski tent, claim my luggage, shower and then finally eat.  To do this took about 1.5 hours because of the many other people wanting to do the same thing.  I probably ate too many cookies but my appetite was very strong and I didn't care what I ate at this point.  The Hooter's chicken sandwich was not enough to satisfy my hunger, but the two Shiners I had satisfied my thirst.

It was time to go home, so I claimed my bus ticket, loaded my bags and boarded the bus with my pillow.  The people on board had lots of enthusiasm as we exchanged stories and experiences.  This lasted for about an hour and we all seemed to fall asleep at the same time.  I woke up with lots of drool on my pillow and felt a little better.  Food was on my mind again and, by this point, I just wanted to be at home in my bed.  We pulled into Tully Stadium, I claimed my bike, drove home, and went to sleep.

My times on this day:  3'25"" from LaGrange to Bastrop, 44"" for lunch, 2'42"" from LaGrange to Austin.  Total time = 6'51""

TOTAL BIKING TIME (including lunches) = 14'26"""

I checked the website for the hotels at Foz.  The tourism website is down.  
It looks like  a great place.  I'll have to convince Renato to go (you know, 
he might miss out on working out for one day).  I think the kids might like 
it too.  Did Alexia and Sebastien like it or was it too much walking?  I 
asked my boss about it.  He went with his family when he was living in 
Argentina.  They really enjoyed it.  Can you go ahead and check on flights 
and which hotel to stay at?  The Hotel Colonial Iguacu e Spa looked like the 
nicer one on the internet.  I imagine the flights will be cheaper booking 
them there.  Is that right?  Let me know the airline and I'll check here.  I 
guess we would go on July 4 and return on July 5.  Also, would y'all want to 
go as well?

Thanks for your help.

Victims and Champions of a Darwinian Enron
By DAVID BARBOZA
OUSTON, Dec. 7 - After an accounting scandal, a bankruptcy filing and mass layoffs, Enron (news/quote) has gone from model of management vision to case study for management obfuscation. Only one group of true believers remains: the people who worked there and just got burned there.

They may be in a minority. After all, 5,600 people have been thrown out of work in the midst of a recession. Most employees lost a huge part of their retirement savings as the value of their Enron stock evaporated. Many are furious at what they view as bungling or worse by top management.

Even so, a surprising number of former employees lament the end of an entrepreneurial culture that more closely resembled a start-up than a Fortune 100 behemoth. That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that worked, they say, even though its dark side, an almost manic drive to experiment with new methods and conquer new markets, resulted in its downfall. Where, they wonder, can they go from here?

""Innovative is a clich?, but that's what Enron was,"" Brandon Rigney, who operated the company's Web site, said on Thursday. ""This is four days gone from the place, and I'm already in withdrawal.""

Enron, which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the world's largest energy trader in the 1990's, created an associate analysts program modeled after Wall Street investment banks. Each year, it tapped 450 college graduates, half of them M.B.A.'s, to spend three years in rotating jobs at all parts of its empire.

It also gave workers opportunities to start new business units. The company's energy trading platform, Enron Online, was created a few years ago by a 29-year-old gas trader. It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions.

In recent years, the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff Shankman, a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at 24. By age 34, he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets.

Mr. Shankman, who has just left the company, said Enron was special because it ""didn't have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity.""

Management experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with convention and turning regular employees like the 29-year-old gas trader into corporate entrepreneurs. And Fortune magazine named it America's most innovative company for six consecutive years. The corporate makeover was largely the work of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August only six months after being promoted to the job.

Under Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, the company tested new strategies, like structuring its corporate culture to mimic the marketplace.

""You could come up with an idea and get people excited,"" said Janel Guerrero, 33, who worked in Enron's government affairs department, noting that a friend in the broadband unit went to top executives with an idea and Enron started moving on it quickly.

""You didn't ponder; it was about acting very quickly and it was about being a first mover,"" she added. 

Enron rapidly created ventures to trade everything from energy, paper, pulp and lumber to broadband and advertising. But quickness sometimes exacts a price. Some ventures went broke, like Azurix (news/quote), its spinoff water company. The broadband unit lost about $1 billion.

""When top management got into broadband, metal, steel, pulp, we thought it was innovative,"" Mr. Rigney said. ""When people said, `We'll trade water and waste water - that's the future,' we said, `That's cool.' I didn't hear dissent in the ranks. But I drank the Kool-Aid with everyone else, even though it made my head throb.""

Indeed, the expansion into new areas drained the profits of the successful energy trading operations, critics say. Undone by shaky accounting and too much borrowed money, the company collapsed last month. But even near the end, it was buzzing with new ventures.

""I just got here five months ago,"" said Fred Radvansky, 38, who was attending a Houston job fair. ""I was part of a group of about 70 people. We were rolling out a new Enron model. We were going to start trading freight.""

If inventiveness flourished at Enron, the freewheeling environment there also encouraged other and less agreeable impulses: cutthroat competition and management arrogance.

""It was kind of like a dot-com phenomenon,"" said Harvey J. Padewer, president of energy services at Duke Energy (news/quote), a big utility. ""They created a kill-and-eat culture.""

Mr. Rigney, the former Web site operator, remembers it well. ""People tried to take work away from you,"" he said. ""There was a Darwinism for ideas, for projects.""

That undermined the company's health, critics say. For example, it is widely believed that compensation for the people who negotiated deals with other companies was based on the size of the transactions rather than their long-term effect on the bottom line.

Annual reviews aimed at weeding out the least productive 5 to 10 percent of the work force damaged morale, and some longtime employees felt unwanted. ""There were all these M.B.A.'s coming in and they were evaluating things differently,"" said Becky Cantrell, who worked on regulatory matters. ""I was one of the oldest people at 55. When I saw someone my age it was a relief.""

For all the doubts some employees harbored, others reveled in the derring-do atmosphere even after Enron's financial fall, and cringed at the prospect of being acquired by Dynegy Inc. (news/quote), a stodgy Houston electric utility.

""They bragged about being a meat-and-potatoes company with people who went to the University of Nebraska,"" one former Enron employee said. ""We had all these hyperactive Harvard and Stanford types. It would have never worked.""

After the merger fell apart, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2 and laid off about 4,000 employees in Houston. Over the next few days, television crews filmed weeping employees streaming out of the headquarters and carrying boxes of personal belongings, even as construction workers put finishing touches on Enron's shimmering new 40-story headquarters office tower. Some got word of their dismissal via voice mail. Others are still packing up and wondering.

""I don't think Enron will ever be recreated,"" Mr. Shankman said on Thursday, sitting on a nearly empty trading floor that was built for 500 people at Enron. ""Maybe we got into some businesses too quickly and too early.""

Enron officials and management experts insist it was not the corporate culture that brought Enron down; it was accounting mistakes or the ballooning debt of hard assets, like projects in Brazil and India.

Those facts may now be plumbed by business school case studies. In the meantime, some former employees have created Enron alumni Web sites. Others are writing letters to The Houston Chronicle about how, for a brief time, they thought they were part of something special.

""Enron was what I thought epitomized a global `American Dream' of sorts,"" wrote Kathy Walthall, a former Enron contractor. ""By far the best days of my career were as a consultant for Enron. The environment was an extreme rush. Very busy, very progressive and innovative.""

But Ms. Walthall said she was also outraged at the board for allowing the company to fall so swiftly.

""I really hope the company turns around,"" she wrote. ""But I know it will never be the same.""

Task Priority:		2
Task Due On:		5/24/1999
Task Start Date:	5/18/1999

DRAW DIAGRAM OF IT SYSTEM FOR CA, MAKE WISH LIST FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND MAKE TIME SAVINGS MATRIX"
3187,"Rogers,

TVA's current bid is $4.75/kw-month, for the term May 1, 2001, through
December 31, 2003.  Enron could call on units not being dispatched by TVA
only if TVA specifically agreed to waive its rights for the specific period.
If the AAF is equal to or less than 50% for a month, then the Demand Charge
for that month will be zero instead of $2/kw-month.

Having the potential of 72 hours of scheduled maintenance per unit each
month significantly reduces the availability of the resources and the low
guaranteed availability during the non-summer also reduces the value to TVA.

Should Enron desire to provide a higher level of availability such as not
excluding the maintenance from the availability calculation or different
product such as unit capacity with LD energy, then that would increase the
value to TVA.

A transaction of this duration is subject to TVA Board approval.

Please let me know if the bid is acceptable, or if Enron want to offer a
product with higher availability.

Thanks,
Stuart

Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly."

I discussed the $35K variance with Brian yesterday, and the adjustment will 
be made on the last day of March.  That will ensure that we tie to your 
number for the rest of the month.  Then we'll do a top level adjustment on 
the last day P&L to clear the variance from last month.  I've talked with 
Brad Jones (the person preparing the NGP&L) and Brian Gillis is supposed to 
remind him at the end of the month.

I start my new job in Chicago next week.  Bilal Bajwa will assume my 
responsibilities.  Here are everyone's numbers.

the managment p&l summaries.  There will be no change in the current DPR 
because all of the YTD and LTD numbers exclude origination.  I can resubmit a 
revised DPR for Jan, Feb and Mar if this makes it easier for you.  This 
change is necessary because the same person is no longer responsible for both 
Origination and Trading in the Calgary office (Lavorato used to be 
responsible for both).  I need this done ASAP because the commercial groups 
need the managment reports to reflect the correct P&L for PRC purposes.

Please call if you have any questions (403-974-6735)

3214,"Dawn,

Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the 
country?  I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were 
gone.  I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.  Without 
you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!  Chris just 
works quietly.  Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no 
idea how to respond to.  And Anne...well I can't even explain that.  

Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.  Nothing really 
happened.  All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't 
tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you 
spell his name).  It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.  I 
haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment 
that needs to be made on last day P&L.  I'm sure I'm not telling you anything 
you don't know.   

Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.  

Hope you enjoyed your trip.

Robin"
3215,"It wasn't just me changing plans.  All I ask is that sometime over the 
weekend we see Finding Forrester.  And of course get my car aligned Sat. and 
a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a 
lot of money this weekend on things that aren't exactly fun.  Oh well.  

I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So 
just call me at home when you get home.  Oh, yeah....Chipper means happy, or 
in a good mood, kind of in a bouncy mood.

Talk to ya later,

O&M services to mobilize and operate the 1 x LM6000 peaking facility to be 
situated in Rochester, Minnesota.   As we discussed, it assumes that 
Rochester Public Utilities has no existing staff and infrastructure in the 
area, but if this assumption should change, then Mobilization and annual

I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my GMAT 
score.  If the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on this 
disability I can do that.  Due to this disability, the GMAT score is not a 
good indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned in my 
work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will be able 
to successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me know what 
I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly appreciate it.  If 
you think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I will do that.  Thanks

thought I could do it too.  I was playing like a spring chicken until my 
first big overhead.  I set up well, ready to bounce that ball right over 
Grant's head.  I thought I was so cool.  Up I  went to find the ball and out 
came flying my  racquet.  On the other side of the net.  Cracked.  Everybody 
stood to stare to see if it was anger or incompetence that created such a 
mess.  I think I better work on that shot.

Hope all is well.

I received your email.  In the US we do physical power puts and calls,  
usually on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (e.g several month deal that 
gives party right to receive/sell energy on a daily basis).  The confirmation 
for them is very simple, and generally assumes an underlying master that 
would govern the physical delivery if the option is exercised as well as all 
the other general terms and conditions.  
By copy of this email, I would ask Leslie Hansen to send you copies of a put 
and call confirmation which she can get from our documentation group.

Looking forward to seeing you soon back in Houston

3275,"During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we=
 are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor buil=
d out given the state of the company today.  We appreciate people's concern=
s about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be redu=
cing unnecessary expenses.  Let us begin by saying that we share these conc=
erns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditu=
res without a great deal of thought.  We would also encourage people to tal=
k to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing=
 certain things.  In short, we have decided to continue with the college re=
cruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire. =
 We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple=
 of weeks.

Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?
During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a p=
resence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading=
 schools in the northwest.  This past year we finally reached critical mass=
 and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.  Although we are unc=
ertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best lon=
g term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the north=
west.  We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at mo=
st schools.  We have identified the best people from each school and have a=
lready made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.  =
The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit =
that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as pa=
rticipants in their on-campus recruiting programs.  We also realize that it=
 is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.  It is our be=
lief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities=
 of employment may be somewhat diminished.  Finally, we would like to empha=
size the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.  We will i=
nterview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions ba=
sed on the needs of the office.  Before extending offers we will consider t=
he potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron e=
mployees in other offices who have been redeployed.  Stated another way, we=
 don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enro=
n who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people alread=
y here at risk.  We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are mor=
e certain about the state of affairs in the company.

How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.  While we =
still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause fo=
r a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money o=
n this.  When talking to the build out team today it became clear that dela=
ying would accomplish several goals.  First, it allows us to get final arch=
itectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can mo=
re precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.  Second, it gives th=
e build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move=
.  Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes=
 sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right n=
ow.  While we still think that we are going to move forward with this proje=
ct, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do=
 right now.  In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team w=
ith firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, o=
r delay again. =20

As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, rel=
iable information becomes available.  We recognize that this is a very hard=
 time for everyone.  Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep=
 up the success of this office.

JOIN US FOR THE KICK - OFF LUNCH 
TUESDAY SEPT 4TH IN MT HOOD  11:30 - 12:30"
3277,"In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" Allowed Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the ""Restricted Top of Stack"" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" All"" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the ""Today's Orders"" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the ""Set"" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the "" Limit Order "" section. In order to do so, right click in the ""Today's Orders "" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window "" Stay On Top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

3283," As we have referenced in our monthly report,  Enron is involved in a dispute 
with Mr. Friedman concerning his involvement in a proposed natural gas 
transportation and marketing arrangement in the Republics of Mozambique and 
South Africa (the ""Pande Project"").   Mark Wawro at Susman Godfrey has been 
representing Enron Southern Africa Development and Enron Oil and Gas 
Mozambique in negotiations with the Friedmans' lawyer, Jim Reed, at Looper 
Reed. 
  On January 16, 2001, the above referenced lawsuit was filed despite the 
fact that the parties had recently met to discuss their respective positions 
and had agreed to exchange documents. The lawsuit was filed in the 133rd 
Judicial District Court of Harris County and, therefore, is pending before 
Judge Lamar McCorkle.  The defendants have not been served and the 
plaintiffs' lawyer has asked Mr. Wawro to accept service on their behalf. 
 The plaintiffs allege that the defendants  breached the subject consulting 
agreement by ""failing to honor and denying any intention to honor, their 
Development Fee and Investment Right obligations under the Consulting 
Agreement"". More specifically, plaintiffs seem to be complaining about a 
failure of the defendants to pay a percentage of the $30 million allegedly 
received in connection with  the transfer of defendants' interest in the 
Pande Project and termination of the plaintiffs' consulting agreement  The 
plaintiffs have also demanded an accounting as well as pre and post judgment 
interest.  A specific dollar amount of the damages sought was not provided.

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)
2001-10-26 16:15 (New York)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.

3317,"Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd 
Mon	11/19	55 Bcfd
Tue	11/20	67 Bcfd
Wed	11/21	69 Bcfd
Thu	11/22	65 Bcfd
Fri	11/23	65 Bcfd
Sat	11/24	63 Bcfd
Sun	11/25	63 Bcfd
Mon	11/26	65 Bcfd

We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions for ENA's NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.  These applications require that ENA represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents have a power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any related commodity future(s) account either individually or acting with another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.

Please direct any responses to my paralegal, Tana Jones, via intercompany email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business on June 15, 2001 if you have any power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any commodity futures account (other than an ENA or other trading affiliate account).

3326,"Troy / Jim:

The following are issues or concerns that I think need to be addressed.  If 
its OK I will pass these on as the pop into my head.
 1)  The 2001 Ad Valorem Tax should be allocated at closing based on the 
period of time each entity owns the facilities.  This is important since 
        the 2001 tax owed should be significantly higher (2 to 3 times the 
2000 value) given the higher pricing.
 2)  Houston PipeLine has an Agricultural Exemption on the land out at Bammel 
on the Ad Valorem Tax.  I believe this Exemption has to be renewed 
every         two years.  I would think that Enron would want to retain 
responsibility for renewing this exemption.  Both parties have a vested 
interest since it will         impact  AEP's tax liability over the next 30 
years but Enron wants the facility back with the exemption intact.
 3)  Houston PipeLine also has an agreement with the state of Texas regarding 
Production Tax.  HPL only pays Production Tax on 7.5% of the 
withdrawal         volumes.  I do not think this will be impacted by the sale 
but it might be worth a quick review by the lawyer's.
Ted Ryan can discuss the Ad Valorem Tax issues with you and the last person I 
talked to about the Production Tax issue was Dan Hyvl.

Hope this is what you are looking for in this process.

 Jim Schwieger"
3327,"We just got some more information in the mail yesterday on the College
Savings Plan.  We will study it some more, and let you know how good or bad
it sounds.  Some good may be that YOU could deduct the amount you give on
YOUR income tax (there doesn't seem to be a cap on deducting the amount you
give if you make big bucks).  The initial bad I see is the $24/year fee plus
.6% of earnings.  Anyway, we will look it over in more detail.  They do not
restrict you to only go to Nebraska colleges, and you do not have to be a
Nebraska resident to open up an account.   Josh and Jarrod could each have
an account, with annual contributions up to $165,000 (tax deferred), and
when you take the money out, it is taxed at Josh and Jarrods tax rate.

Please remind me/reassure me about the Educational IRA.  It is similar to a
Roth IRA in that taxes are paid (by you in this case)on the money prior to
putting it into the account.  I don't list it anywhere on my income tax
forms until we start taking the money out.  In essence it is as if we are
putting $500 of our own money (taxes already paid) into the account, right?

There is no school again today.  Ice on the roads and more ice and snow to
come later today. I think this is the 5th or 6th day they have missed.  They
have to make it up at the end of the school year.

Mom said your house on the lake is all done being remodeled.  Bet it looks
nice.

Have a great day!

Love,
Linda

How's it going?  It's that time of year again.  Please don't forget me should 
you have any leftover rodeo tickets.  I will be forever greatful as with all

clues...please advise.  Thanks.




"
3346,"I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked 
your question yesterday.  ""IT revenue crediting"" is an industry term used to 
describe a requirement (brought about either by a FERC order or a rate case 
settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be 
credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some 
refund mechanism.  Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue 
crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such 
obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the 
same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis. 

If you need more info, let's talk.

DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?
Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS 
By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas 
Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. 
The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?'']. 
Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. 
CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business. 
Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg. 
For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron. 
``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli. 
That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' 
Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' 
Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it.

respects to load up HDD and CDD products with ENA as the counterparty which 
reference temperature readings in Australian cities. The contractual will be 
USD. Trading can commence as soon as they can be loaded. Services provided by 
Enron Australia to ENA associated with this activity be charged under to ENA 
under the EA/ENA  Service Agreement. 

I understand from a tax perspective the situation is essentially the same 
should  weather readings be for Japanese rather than Australian cities. 
However, irrespective of the source of the weather data (Australia, Japan, 
USA etc) Jane has advised there is a level of legal due diligence will need 
to be conducted if a potential counterparty is incorporated in Japan. This 
relates to the ability to enforce a trade through the Japanese legal system, 
which would be necessary should the counterparty only have assets in Japan. 
In other words the legal issue relates to the place of incorporation/business 
of the counterparty not the source of the weather 
readings.                    "

With regard to Section 2, 6(c), 14, 17 and 24:

   Section 2: Our debit rate benchmark for $ is the 30 day Libor rate with a
   spread.  We typically do not reference the rate in the agreement to allow 
for
   changes.  We do have an interest schedule that I can have e-mailed to you 
on
   Monday when the salesperson returns.
   Section 6 (c): Our credit rate benchmark for $ is the 13 wk T-bill with a
   spread.  As above, we typically do not reference the rate in the agreement 
to
   allow for changes as agreed between JPMFI and Client.  I will have our
   salesperson include this schedule in the e-mail.
   Section 14: If we are to include arbitration language, the CFTC mandates 
the
   exact form (180.3 of the CEA).  I can fax you the language and the reg.
   Please send me an e-mail with your fax number.
   Section 17: Unfortunately we cannot accept the additional language.  
Clients
   are sent daily statements in which they are required to notify us any
   objections within 24 hours since the nature of the futures market is such
   that large market movements can occur over short periods of time.  The
   monthly statement is a recap of the daily statements and the same reasoning
   applies.
   Section 24:  We can accept the deletion of the witness line as long as 
Enron
   does not intend to trade SGXDT.



Please feel free to call me at your earliest convenience (212) 648-4292.

Thank you and Regards,
Corinne

=09
=09Springtime brings  so many photo opportunities: flowers in bloom, childr=
en in=20
Easter  finery, butterflies, bunnies, and egg hunts. To capture the best =
=20
moments in pictures, make sure you are zoom-wise! First let''s start  with=
=20
the basics.[IMAGE]
=09
=09Zoom settings  are the focal lengths available to you. They are labeled =
 and=20
measured in millimeters (this measurement is actually the distance  between=
=20
the lens element and the film). Zoom settings fall into  3 categories: wide=
=20
angle (less than 28mm), normal (28mm - 50mm),  and telephoto (above 50mm).=
=20
Wide angle settings allow you to capture  a broader scene without physicall=
y=20
moving farther away. Normal settings  let you capture as much as one of you=
r=20
eyes sees (your angle  of view with both eyes open is approximately 28mm an=
d=20
about 50mm  with one eye closed). Since a camera has only one eye (lens),=
=20
50mm  is considered normal. Telephoto settings soar above 50mm, magnifying =
=20
the subject and narrowing the angle of view.=20
=09
=09[IMAGE]To  capture fields of springtime flowers or entire yards on film,=
 try =20
using a setting such as 28mm or 35mm. They will provide a  sweeping view of=
=20
spring color. Remember also that early morning  and late afternoon light=20
intensifies spring hues. Bright  noontime sun is beautiful but will wash ou=
t=20
your photos'' colors  (and cause your subjects to squint). If midday is you=
r=20
only chance  to snap pictures, then try for a bright, cloudy day!=20
=09
=09When photographing  people and animals, it''s best to use low telephoto=
=20
settings, such  as 80mm-120mm. These provide accurate facial and body=20
proportions.  It also helps to keep your camera level with your subject,=20
rather  than pointing downward or upward. If you''re snapping photos of=20
small  children this may mean getting down on their level. The telephoto =
=20
setting will also allow you to be farther away, and less of a distraction  =
to=20
them. After all, the best kid-shots are the spontaneous ""un-posed""  ones!=

How are you doing? I am so sorry to hear about all the stress happening over there. I am thinking about and hope you can take a vacation soon! Things here are fine. Just getting ready for the holidays. I was hoping to talk to you about gifts for my dad. I am not sure what to get him. I got him a subscription to Sports Illustrated and was thinking about getting him  DVD player. What are your suggestions?
Anythign would be a huge help! And I am excited to see you in New Orleans too. I am there for a week and hoping to spend some time with you all. Have a good day.

warning by Moody's rating agency that it was prepared to downgrade Japan's =
domestic yen rating as early as next month helped solidify fears amongst th=
e Japanese. Meanwhile, fading weak yen rhetoric and a stabilizing Nikkei he=
lped shore up the sell off of Japanese assets, thereby lending support to t=
he yen.  Initially, USD/JPY rose to a day's high of 133.37 following the ne=
ws that the downgrade would be at least two notches from the current Aa3. H=
owever, the yen was able to rise to a day's high of 132.23 after tripping s=
top loss orders around USD/JPY support at 132.50. EUR/JPY fell to a low of =
115.73, down from a day's high of 116.80 and well off Tuesday's high of 117=
.52. USD/JPY support now seen at 132.20 followed by 131.90 and 131.20.  USD=
/JPY is likely to trade in a range between 130 to 135 into the month of Mar=
ch. Despite the fact that the market is convinced of further yen weakness t=
o come this year, JPY remains supported in the short term. JPY losses shoul=
d also be contained to 135 against the dollar now that Japanese officials e=
ased off their weak yen policy last week.  Moreover, USD/JPY came off Monda=

 inject as much as $US 78 billion into the financial sector. This has halte=
d the sell off in Japanese assets by foreign investors we saw last month. T=

s that in January, foreigners' net Japan bond selling rose to Y1.2368 trln =
from a mere Y172.22 bln in December. Therefore, this side of the repatriati=
on equation has settled down and JPY should remain supported by recent capi=
tal flows data for February which showed Japanese investors sold an unusual=
ly large 575.6 billion yen ($4.30 billion) in foreign securities last week,=
 the sixth straight week of net sales. This should keep Japanese repatriati=
on fears until the end of March when the fiscal year ends.  Meanwhile, the =
dollar traded steady against the European majors today as dealers await tod=
ay's US retails sales report for January. Declining vehicle sales and low g=
as prices will weigh on total January retail sales growth, which is expecte=
d at flat to slightly negative. However, excluding auto sales, core retail =
sales should show its first a slight rise as consumer confidence remains st=
rong. Markets are therefore anxious to know how the consumer reacted in Jan=
uary after a strong spending binge in December. A better than expected figu=
re would be bullish for the dollar as it would show one cannot underestimat=
e the US consumer   even in a recession.  EUR/USD held near a day's low of =
87.41, which marks key support for the pair. On Tuesday, offers at 88.00/10=
 kept a cap on EUR/USD again after Monday's wave of stop-loss buying failed=
 to develop into more sustainable demand for the euro. A break below 87.40 =
would target 87.10/00 and a break of that level would be the first strong c=
onfirmation of resumption in the euro's bear trend.  Yet, even if the euro =
holds above 87.40, it still needs to clear 88 cents followed by key resista=
nce at 88.75/80 to remove its bearish outlook. That level marks the 61.8% r=
etracement of this year's high to low of 90.63 to 85.63. Looking forward, u=
nless the single currency can rise above the 88.80-cent level, its momentum=
 should wane and turn back south again.  The euro also added to losses agai=
nst the pound as it fell to a new low of 60.99 pence. The euro began to wea=
ken against the pound after a test of 61.95 last Friday was rejected. Tuesd=
ay's break below 61.55 support triggered stop loss sales on its way to a lo=
w of 61.32. Therefore, renewed pressure on the pair could carry it back tow=
ards this month's lows around 60.68 pence. This would cause the euro to giv=

All Members, Staff and Occupants of One North End Avenue

FROM:
Vincent Viola, Chairman
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:
On-Going Air Quality Testing


Air Quality Update
Air quality testing within One North End Avenue has been and will continue
to be the first priority of this Exchange.  As we previously indicated, the
Exchange has engaged Ambient Group, Inc., an extremely reputable independent
laboratory specializing in this area, to monitor the Exchange's air quality.
The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on testing for dangerous
chemicals outside the building.  Air quality tests were performed on
September 14th, 20th, 26th, October 4th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 23rd, 26th, 30th,
November 6th,  8th and, to date, all results have been well below the EPA,
OSHA, ASHREA, and ACGIH levels.

The air samples collected were tested for over 300 types and/or isomers of
chemicals including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for asbestos
structures, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, Acenaphtene, Acenaphthylene,
Anthracence, Benz (a) anthracene, Benz (a) pyrene, Benzo (b) fluorathene,
Benzo (ghi) perylene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, Chrysene, Dibenz (a,h)
anthracene, Fluoranthene, Flourene, Indeno (1,2,3 cd) pyrene, Napthalene,
Phenanthrene, Pyrene, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, Manganese,
Nickel, Silica and Zinc.

Ambient Group, Inc., has also secured a high-volume air sampling monitor
that tested for air borne chemicals outside the building including
chlorinated dioxins, PCBs, brominated dioxims and polycyclic hydrocarbons
(PAHs).  The results from these reports indicated that the levels of these
individual compounds are below their respective standards and guidelines.

All test results are posted and made available to all building occupants on
a weekly basis.

Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Elliot
Zuckerman, Property Manager, at (212) 299-2242."
3409,"Sara,

I have drafted the attached based on what we did for the GDR acquisition.  
Could you check the non-India trading names and titles to make sure they are 
current.  I checked with Samantha but she said she was having computer 
problems and wasn't familiar with the names.  And, obviously, we will not 
have this done by Monday morning.  Is there anything we can do to get the 
account opened on an expedited basis and then follow up with paperwork later?



Lena,

Once Sara checks the non-India names, may I have your permission to put your 
initials on these documents and get them signed?

Thanks,
Lauren

3433,"The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

All I did was ""hide"" some columns that were not necessary and made the 
spreadsheet fit to one letter sized page.  This is the same spreadsheet that 
Enron provided to you yesterday evening that you have checked out with.  
Please let me know if you need anything changed on this.

I'll be waiting on your 'polished' physical power spreadsheet in similar 
format to Enron's for easy comparison.  Lastly, I'll also wait on your 
'reformatted' financial power spreadsheet.

Enron Corp. will provide a certificate from the officer executing the 
guarantee that the guarantee complies with the policy for issuance of 
guarantees as approved by the Enron Corp. Board of Directors and an 
incumbency certificate from an Assistant Secretary of Enron Corp. stating 
that the officer signing the guarantee is authorized to do so.  This is 
widely accepted by all of Enron Corp.'s counterparty's in all of its 
transactions involving trade guarantees.  I will also need the effective date 
of the guarantee for purposes of insertion into the appropriate certificates 
and the guarantee.  Thanks

I can certainly participate in your Tuesday morning meetings (and I can 
appreciate the time constraints under which Andrea is working!).  I believe 
that Lynn will defer to Rick's participation.  Please let me know if there is 
a call in number.  I think that I will be able to keep you updated through 
your meetings.  My need for meeting with Lynn and Brent stems from the fact 
that we are ""offshore"" Brazil and need to communicate regularly to keep the

I have verified with CP that we do not want to stop financial trading between 
CP and ENA.  The immediate plan is as follows:

(1)  Immediate new guaranty from Mirant Corporation  (Frank to send draft in 
the a.m.)

(2)  Immediate amendment of the existing ISDA Master Agreement to replace 
Vastar with Mirant Corporation as the credit support provider (CP to send 
draft in the a.m.)

(3)  Immediate execution of a short letter agreement to reflect that all 
financial trades done until the effective date of the new guaranty will be 
honored by CP and subject to the existing ISDA Master Agreement (I will 
prepare)

(4)  Review of the existing agreement to see if CP has issues (which we may 
consider).

If anyone has any questions, please let me knowl  

Let's all stay in touch throughout the day to get this done.  Thanks.

Per our conversation, attached is a short ""recap"" of the companies and amounts involved.

With respect to prime brokerage accounts, the following approximate cash balances are held by Bear Stearns & Co. (""Bear"") in accounts for the following companies:

Enron North America Corp.	$159,022		[filing debtor]

ECT Investments, Inc.		$3,923,970.84		[has not filed]

Enron Credit Inc.		$10,500,000		[has not filed]

I understand that one of our U.K. companies, Enron Credit Limited, has been in touch with one of your employees with respect to the return of the Enron Credit Inc. cash and was told that Bear wished to offset that amount against the amount owed by Enron Credit Limited to Bear under OTC trades, approx. $1,500,000, for a net balance of approx. $9,000,000.

ECT Investments Inc. sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on November 30, 2001 requesting return of its cash balance.  I do not believe that ECT Investments, Inc.has any OTC trades with Bear but I will need to verify.

We would like to resolve the return of cash issues.  Please feel free to contact me.

Click on Start->run and type (or you can cut and paste):

""C:\Program Files\McAfee\virusScan NT\mcconsol.exe"" click Okay

You will get a message from ""Virus Scan NT Anti-virus Console"" with a status 
report

When you get into the program, click on help and then about.  The screen 
should look like this:



If it doesn't, either call tech support and place a call, or log out properly 
at night.  

To log out properly, click on start->shut down and either restart the 
computer or close all programs and log on as a different user.  This will 
allow the computer to receive the proper version of the virus scan engine and 
dat file.

for EGM for crude and products.  Please mention to Caroline we are not trying 
to crowd her out, just get more depth on funds coverage.  Also, when we talk 
about other GRM products, it will help to have more fund coverage.  (We can 
also address her issue later--I agree with you on that.)  Proceed, but I'm 
not sure about the JV with ENA issue.  Let's not go down that road

3476,"John--this is the recap from Thursday afternoon of RTO week.  Although Andy=
 did not focus on it in his report, there was an individual who sat on the =
panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market =
postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy.  His name is Bil=
l Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Sp=
ringfield, Missouri.  In his comments he stated that his utility was ""whole=
heartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO"" and then went =
on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss=
ues if FERC doesn't stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs.

He stated that ""flexible"" standardization would not work and that the FERC =
should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some uti=

"
3478,"This is to inform you the recent approval of the below commented rules in 
Argentina. If the economic and political environment gets calmer, these rules 
will be an important step in the power deregulation process an will allow us 
to reach some of the goals set for the regulatory group for this year.

Goal 1- Eliminate or Increase fuel declaration caps: there will not be more 
fuel declarations but price declarations (Section 1, Resolution 135). The 
rules do not mention any cap for price declarations.

Goal 2 - Daily fuel declaration: The 6 month fuel declaration was replaced by 
a daily price declaration (Section 1, Resolution 135).

Goal 3 - Reduce or eliminate the obligation to physically back up agreements 
with end users or LDCs: According to the interpretation of AGEERA (Gencos 
Association) we would have been gotten also this objective and marketers may 
already buy or sell spot as long as the contract with the customer does not 
have supply guarantee (Section 5, Resolution 135). It is not clear in the 
rule wich is the condition for marketers to buy or sell spot.

Now the Secretariat of Energy must issue its own Resolution to amend the 
technical Procedures in line with these rules. From the text of Resolution 
135 (sections 3 c, 5 and considerations) there would be a good probability to 
reach other two goals through the Secretariat of Energy rule:
Reduce minimum term for Output & Demand Marketing Agreements to one month
Eliminate or reduce to 1 MW the threshold for Output Marketing Agreements

Amr and I are asisting Buenos Aires Ofice to analize the new rules to 
eventually submit comments to the Secretariat of Energy.
Attached is the document with the regulatory goals.

3479,"Jim,

I am leaving a binder of material for you with Lucy that includes all of the 
correspondence to date with Verizon.  While you should not feel obliged to 
read all of it by any means, I have tabbed several summaries of meetings or 
calls that we had which might give you a better idea of how obstructive 
Verizon has been thus far; to that extent, I have highlighted certain 
passages as well.  However, I would encourage you to read the June 14th 
letter that we sent to Jeff Masoner (VP of Interconnection Services of 
Verizon Services Corp.) as it provides a general summary of our 
correspondence with Verizon.  The letter is included in the binder.

The critical issues for us are as follows:

1. Verizon has not provided an answer as to whether it will provide terms, 
conditions and prices for OC-3, 12 and 48 loops and OC-48 transport for 
inclusion in an interconnection agreement or supplemental agreement/amendment.

2. Verizon has not provided us with the relevant loop and transport rates for 
the seven states where we seek interconnection (MA, NJ, NY, DC, VA, PA and 
CA).  We sent them specific information regarding central office locations, 
CLLI codes, and mileage for the 7 states, however, in response to their 
request for this information in order to provide us with corresponding rates.

In addition, nobody from Verizon has responded to the letter that we sent to 
Jeff Masoner, nor have any of the deadlines that were set forth in the letter 
been met (e.g., answer inquiry #1 above by June 20th; answer inquiry #2 by 
July 11th).  Please note that there are other issues that still need to be 
discussed and resolved, and a list of those questions is included in the 
binder.  It is my hope that, in the course of mediation, the NY Commission 
would assist us with negotiating all of our issues.

I have asked Lucy to schedule a call for you with Paul Lacouture (President, 
Network Services Group, Verizon Communications) to occur on Monday, July 
16th.  She is in the process of doing so.  Paul Racicot, Stewart Seeligson, 
and Frank Bay are aware of our desire to file for mediation with the NY 
Commission subsequent to your call with Lacouture;  Sue and I will be 
discussing this with Everett on Friday morning.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  Although I will be 
traveling, I will check messages and my cell number is 713-851-7770 if you 
need to reach me.  Thank you for your assistance.

Regards,

3480,"Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West 
Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the 
above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their 
analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the 
agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state 
in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their 
nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we 
excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas 
portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  
These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  
Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The 
spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative 
""mark-to-market"" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  
Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

3483,"Rick - Over the weekend we agreed to terms with PSE&G on a gas case 
requestiung the transfer of pipeline capacity contracts.  In return for our 
support, we obtained the following:
 Two three year gas storage deals with ENA;
 Three year Capacity Management, when Residential customers move to market 
prices, (probably within two-three years);
 5% Basic Generation Service when BGS market opens 8/02.

ENA is currently valueing the gas deals, however, my guess is they are worth 
approximately $3-5 million.  The cap mgt deal will be worth approximately 
$25-30 million, whiule the BGS will be a liitle difficullt to quantify at 
this point.  There was also a general understanding with Steve Teitleman, 
President PSEG Genco, to increase the business between ENA and PS, both in 
power and gas.  

I will forward the LOI when it is signed, probably within a few days.  As 
always please call if you wish to discuss the details.

Sue Nord, Sr. Director
Government Affairs
713 345-4196"
3486,A phone call was held today.  Some issues / actions from the call 
3487,"I talked to Bill Butler after this came out. Bill and Judge Miller supposedly advised the Governor that this moratorium was not a good idea. I suggested to Bill that LG&E was behind this, but he told me that the Gov is also planning a Senate run, and that this move is related. I also mentioned this to Johnny Hayes. Between Bill and Johnny, I should be able to get more info. Bill also told me he was named to the State energy committee.

We are working on Calvert, but as we have already applied for an air permit, we are only potentially affected to the extent we modify the equipment in our application. As such, I would like to see the text of the Governor's order to determine if equipment changes for applications already submitted would be precluded. Dave Kellermeyer / Scott Churbock are also looking into this.

As you know, we face a similar moratorium in Georgia. I have asked Johnny Hayes to find out if there is any movement in TN with respect to a moratorium.

I think for right now, my group's main need is to (i) understand the KY moratorium and whether it precludes us from changing equipment in our air permit application; (ii) whether a moratorium could spread to TN (we have a couple more sites we're working on there); and (iii) if we can leverage any political connections in GA to help us navigate the particulars of that state's moratorium.  

Barbara, toward that end, it would be helpful if you would contact Raimund Grube (x 3-0433) on Georgia, and Chris Booth (x 5-3364) on Tennessee. I'd like you to work with them and Churbock / Kellermeyer on answering these three questions.

Thanks much.

3490,"Judge McCartney presented her report on the SE RTO mediation to FERC last Wed.  Her recommendation was for the Grid model: Transco on top/Independent Market Admin. (IMA) in the RTO (model presented by GridSouth, Grid Florida and Entergy) rather than Southern's model (Gridco on top, transmission owners and ind. transcos under).  The Commissioners did not make a decision, but stated that they planned to address the SE RTO at the next Commission meeting on Nov 7 (after they have received comments on RTO week).

The judge discussed the biggest obstacles to public power agreeing to the Grid model:  Southern gave them 100% transmission recovery on Day 1 and the Grids had a phase-in (pursuant to the Commission's previous orders in GridFlorida).  I think that many of the publics also liked the fact that Southern gave them full grandfathering of current contracts.

Chair Wood had questions about the split of responsibilities between the transmission-owning transco on top and the IMA and about the fiduciary duties of the transco board.  The judge stated that most publics wanted a non-profit ISO on top.  When Massey stated that most states wanted the traditional non-profit ISO, Wood said: ""that would put the cabosh on this model,"" then asked why the publics don't like the operating agreements with the RTO.  There was discussion about concerns that the transco would favor transmission solutions over gen.  Massey pointed out that the NE ISOs simply don't want their models changed, so that should not keep the Commission from approving the transco-type model.

Breathitt stated that cost/benefit analyses were important, especially for this region of low cost power.

Brownell stated that the Commission needed to act quickly because the market was already putting capital into transcos."
3491,"Wade:

Two of the issues that I was looking forward to discuss with you in Houston were as follows:
The opinion of the GA - Washington Team of the outstanding Government Affairs issues that need to be taken care of in the coming period, and
How can Houston G&Reg. Affairs help you during Ken Ley expected visit to India.
 
Washington Team informed me that  they shall continue providing their support on as-needed basis.  Their understanding is that these needs  will be determined by you directly, as Jane was not directly involved in determining these needs.   They shall accommodate any changes in the personnel structure, if it happens, and will work accordingly.  In the same context, their evaluation at this time is that GoI is not ready to take a decision soon on DPC issue.  Furthermore, they even doubt any discussion that purports that GoI is deliberately ignoring the issues so that to create a form-of-a-crisis, then step forward to solve it and seek a quid-pro-quo from the US Gov.; Coalition governments are rarely that organized.  It follows, they continue, Dr. Ley's visit is unlikely to be effective, and very possibly, we are spending our ""golden bullet"" a bit too early.  

In reference to Ken Ley visit, I was trying to consolidate your team by asking Rick Shapiro to be in the same time in India.  The objectives are: a)  introduce the entire Team in India (government, and regulatory, also commercial, and legal) to him so that he can rally all support your needs in a cost-effective, and continuous,  manner from Houston at this important juncture, and b) ensure that all resources from Washington are properly mobilized during this visit.   Please,  let me know what you think of this idea.

Finally, I am still working on EBS needs and shall keep you posted shortly.

pertinent section of the bill is section 3--although other sections of the 
bill may provide opportunities for:

 EES:  state agencies and school districts are required to complete energy 
audits and implement cost-effective conservation, with performance contracts 
being the preferred method; and
ENA:  utilities (both COUs and IOUs) must offer renewable energy products to 
customers.

statement was ""If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have 
another talk"".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is

    Thank you again for extending me an invitation to be on your committee to
select the new Houston Fire Chief.  I look forward with much enthusiasm and
excitement to working with you and the committee members on this very
important project.

    I enjoyed our visit at the Doubletree immensely. It was great walking
down memory lane and recalling our days in Cambridge. We probably passed each
other at Harvard Square at some point during our time there.  As I said, I am
a great admirer of you and ENRON. The innovation, creativity and unique
(though soon to be widely copied) business plan make ENRON one of Houston's
(and the nation's, maybe also California's in the near future) great assets.

     Since the subject came up in our conversation, I will add a short
personal note. After reviewing several potential transactions this week, it
is quite possible that my partners and I will be entering into a ""business
defining"" transaction in the next two months. Since I am a lousy golfer, I
will be exploring new challenges.

3525,"Tom,

Thakns again for your concern.  You're asking a lot of good questions.

The best indication my building is ok is that its standing, and that it's
contemporaires are all standing as well.  You may have read that the
buildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in the
lowlands.  Mine is neither.  Spoke to my landlord today, who is an engineer
of some sort, and for what its worth he said the building is a good one.

About shots, I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF,
though he wasn't planning for one of the worst natural disasters in our
time.  I'm keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of the
diseases they're worried about here, but am pretty sure that one cirterion
is that you have to be pretty darn close, which I'm not.

I'm not our sticking my nose into anything, though would love to see things
up close for curiosity's sake.  Trouble is, I'd just be getting in the way,
which I don't want to do.  So will, for now, restrict myself to giving a
little cash and observing what goes on here on the home front.  The damage
really is not apparent from here.  As I mentioned in my note to dad, things
are pretty darn normal.  Expect indirect impact to be visable, like
worsening inflation for example.  But that's about it.  Will keep an eye out
for trouble, though.

More later.  Thanks again for taking the time to write.  Its always nice to
hear from you.

Love,

Mark

3528,"Someone posted the idea that we remove some pictures because it was
getting sort of messy in the picture folder.  We still have lots of
storage space and since many of the brothers are still getting their
first view of eWooglin.com I think we should keep all the pics. They
are listed in alphabetical order in the folders.

I took the liberty of moving all the pictures into folders. So just
post any new pictures in the top level folder ""Pictures"" and you can
find all the others in the lower level folders entitled ""golf""
or ""football game"" etc. If you want to post the pictures directly to
a sub-folder, that's perfectly OK too, because the email notice that
is automatically sent when you upload a picture file will send us all
the right place. But casual browsers looking for new pictures may not
think to look into the sub-folders.

To navigate back out of a lower level folder just click on the
word ""Files"" in the left hand column. That puts you at the top of the
folder directory and you can then click on ""Pictures"" again.  That
puts you back to the newest pictures and all the other picture files.
Sorry if this slows down getting to around to all the files. Looking
at the pics by staying within one folder is still the fastest way to
see all of them.

I'm sure if you don't like this solution, you'll let me know. There
are no shy Betas.

Thanks for all the great pictures and commentary. It's a joy to see
your stuff when I take a break at work from trying to ""Enable the

3529,"Rick,

With the recent burst of the Internet and communications bubble in the public 
equity markets, I wanted to send you an email describing our position, 
exposure and ongoing strategy.  Our aggressive use of accounting management 
vehicles, and early sales of positions has significantly reduced our 
accounting volatility and economic exposure.  Hopefully, the following points 
will address the appropriate issues.

Currently we have invested $108 million in 22 companies.  Of that, 
approximately $80 million still has accounting exposure.  The other $28 
million invested has either been hedged or already written down.  Our 
disciplined use of Fair Value accounting has allowed us to minimize 
accounting risk by not writing up investments simply because of improving 
market conditions.
Specifically - Avici, Sycamore, and FastForward have generated approximately 
$180 million in earnings this year.  DEN, Salus Media, and IAM.com have 
combined for $9 million in writeoffs.
Recently, I have done a review of our portfolio and I believe our accounting 
loss exposure for 2001 is limited.  Over 80% of our portfolio companies have 
raised enough capital to sustain them through all of 2001.  So, if the 
markets (private and public) are closed, I do not believe these companies 
will risk bankruptcy during 2001.  Also, our discipline of only co-investing 
with big partners helps assure these companies will continue to get funding.

Going forward, we are making certain revisions to our strategy to take 
compensate for, and take advantage of, the weak markets.
Limiting venture investments to technology companies that we have a 
competitive advantage in assessing the technology risk.  Also, moving our 
venture effort earlier stage to take more technology risk and less market 
risk.
We are beginning to look at other types of private equity investments.  There 
are many public companies, whose stock prices are at 10% or less of their 
highs.  I still believe that the fundamentals of the industries indicate that 
the vast majority of these companies will go bankrupt.  However, there will 
be a select few that will survive and will end up with reduced competition 
and big markets.  These companies will be big winners.  We are carefully 
looking for these.  I will keep you informed as this develops.

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Kevin Garland"

 HTC is pleased to present Verliant to the Houston Angel Network.
For additional information, please contact Pamela Harris, Founder, of
Verliant.

 Best regards, and as always, your feedback is greatly appreciated.

 Michelle Weisblatt
 Development Manager
 Houston Technology Center

 Verliant, Inc.
  <<...>>
 Corporations today are confronted with a myriad of laws and
regulations from Federal, State and Local governments. Complying with these
regulations costs companies billions of dollars annually, in direct
compliance costs alone.   Furthermore, the risk of non-compliance is
significant and costs companies both directly, in terms of fines and
litigation, and indirectly in terms of increased insurance premiums.  OSHA,
which is only one of several compliance categories, estimates that companies
spend over $67 million annually--in fines alone.   Litigation and settlement
can cost multiples of the government fines.  Verliant has developed a
web-based, artificial intelligence tool that helps companies maintain
regulatory compliance and successfully manage operational risks. The initial
product focuses on compliance in environmental, health, safety and training.
The technology is developed and has completed a successful beta test with
its first client, Allied Waste Corporation. Contracts have been signed with
initial revenues to occur in January 2001.

 Technology & Product
  * U.S. employers face a multitude of onerous record
keeping and compliance responsibilities. The administrative burden of
maintaining up to date knowledge of, and complying with, regulatory
requirements is significant.
  * Verliant automates key management compliance
processes that were previously ignored or handled manually by employers' HR,
Safety or Legal departments.  Employers recognize significant cost savings
in compliance and substantial decreases in non-compliance.  Likewise,
productivity and the effectiveness of safety programs are enhanced.
  * Applications modules include: Human Resources
(Employee Record Management); Healthcare Compliance Auditing; Medical
Surveillance; Substance Abuse Program Tracking; Training, Evaluation and
Endorsement Tracking; DOT Driver Qualification File Maintenance; Event
Management; Accident and Injury Reporting, Tracking and Analysis; and
Industrial Hygiene.

 Market
  * There are over 6.5 million American firms that must
comply with regulatory standards.
  * OSHA estimates annual compliance costs at $33
billion.

 Marketing Strategy
  * Initial focus will be through direct sales to
Fortune 2000 companies.
  * Pricing is based on a monthly fee of about $2 per
employee.
  * Verliant has signed contracts with Allied Waste and
San-i-Pak.
  * The company plans to implement multi-tiered, direct
sales, distribution model supplemented by resellers with substantial
existing presence within niche target markets.  The company is negotiating
agreements with several resellers in both the medical and waste management
industries.

 Competition
  * Verliant has identified two direct competitors. The
first is Medgate, a privately held Canadian company that offers several
competing modules, but is not yet internet-based. The second is Complient,
which is in development of an internet-based compliance solution,
supplemented by training and safety product sales.
  * Other companies such as J.J. Keller, a privately
held company focused on the Department of Transportation (DOT) solution
only, is not internet-based.
  * A more distant competitor is PureSafety.com, which
focuses only on OSHA Training Tools.
  * Verliant is developing strategic relationships and
marketing alliances with several companies in the medical, waste management,
and PEO industries.

 Competitive Advantages
  * Management Team - The Company's executive management
skills, domain expertise, market knowledge, distribution channels,
intellectual property, and price versus performance are one of its greatest
strengths.
  * Superior Functionality - No competitors offer
Verliant's comprehensive suite of compliance rule-based solutions, on-line
document imaging, or full-service data entry and date loading.
  * ASP Delivery Model - The advantages of the ASP
include easy to use Internet based solutions, proprietary compliance rules
algorithms, and flexible reporting functions.
  * Brand Leadership - The Company's competitive
strategy will be based upon building brand awareness by virtue of its
expertise and the founder's reputation in the occupational health and safety
industry.

 Organizational Information
  Management Team

3533,"Have been in Antakya for the last couple days.  Will leave tomorrow.  Might
spend a night in Iskenderun on the coast, or might head back to Istanbul via
Ankara (where I hope to spend a day) by train.

Antakya formally named Antioch, of great import to Christian history.  (If
you look on  a map, I'm in the that finger of land that extends down from
Turkey between Syria and the Mediterranean.)  Not much in the town of great
beauty; mostly just modern, cement based, instantly aged, utilitarian styled
buildings.  Things stitched together, rickety, somewhat polluted.  The town,
however, surrounded by impressive mountains.  Have met a young Arab man, who
has shown me around (saw some spectacular thousand year old ruins (build by
Christians; destroyed by Muslims) on top of a mountain not far from here,
from which vantage point we could look out over the Mediterranean (and a
setting sun) and also to the south at a snow capped mountain that stood
between us and nearby Syria).  Last night joined him and his friends.  We
ate this heavenly kebab wrapped in thin, fried (in olive oil) unleaven bread
(the whole thing called Durum), then I watched as they played a card game
akin to Bridge.  (Did you know that Bridge was invented in Istanbul some 150
years ago by a few British soldiers stationed there during the Crimean War?
The name came from the fact they crossed the Galata Bridge [not far from my
place] each evening.  [Florence Nightingale (sp?) also stationed in Istanbul
during that same war, which was when she made her name.]) Two of the players
were Christian, one was Turk and the fourth my ""new"" Arab friend.  This
provence, Hatay, is apparently the most diverse one here in Turkey, in an
ethnic, cultural, religious sense.

Boat ride over from Cyprus an ordeal.  Seas rough.  Took twice as long (4
hours instead of 2) as advertized.  I got worried when the stewards passed
out small plastic bags as we left port.  I lasted about an hour and a half
before I used mine, but was part of a vast majority of fellow suffers.  I
guess I didn't inherent sea legs for my old man.

More later,

Love,

Mark

3534,"Dad and mom,

As for my Cyprus trip, I flew into Lafkosia, the Turkish controlled half of
a town that the Greeks call Nicosia (which is probably the name that shows
up on the map).  From there went to a town called Maras (Greek name Varosha)
on the east coast.  Actually stayed in the contiguous town named Gazimagusa
(Famagusta to the Greeks).  (Just the name confusion suggests some pretty
deep problems on Cyprus, doesn't it.)  Have been working on an piece about
Maras for the last few days. Think its a winner.  Maras has been a ghost
town since the Turkish ""peace operation"" (i.e. invasion) in 1974, its empty,
spooky beach lined by abandoned high rise hotels.  Could get only so far as
a militarized border fence.  Should be timely in light of UN sponsored
""proximity talks"" between the two sides that continue in Geneva on January
31st.

After going to Girne (Kyrenia), I returned to Turkey by a hydrofoil, which
though not similar in design probably close to the size of the ferry we used
to cross from SF to Marin.  I suppose that it riding above the waves at
times made things more smooth, though it didn't seem that way.  (Not even
sure those things are to be used on rough seas.) Occasionally when we hit a
big roll the bottom of the boat would drop back down to the sea with a huge,
literally nauseating slap.  (The boat equivalent of a belly flop I suppose.)
  I think the skipper, to avoid the roughest of the seas, cut directly over
to the Turkish coast, which we then followed east to the port of Tasucu.  I
guess it was probably a wise strategy, but more than doubled the time (and
discomfort).  Still, especially now consigned to memory, a great experience.

It's snowing here too, pretty hard.  First big one for Istanbul, though the
rest of Turkey has been hit hard already.  (For example, I was wearing sun
glasses on my train ride back here, to cut down the snow glare.)  Most of
the snow now falling seems to be melting on the ground.  Besides being
beautiful (from the comfort of inside), my English lesson (I'm the teacher,
believe it or not) was cancelled, so I'm excited to get back to my writing.

Things go well.  Thanks for the note.

Love,

Mark-O

3535,"Great to hear from you!  I got both messages.

How fun about Suleyman's fabric samples.  Hope they aren't the last
straw that broke the camel's back.  (Oh yeah, no camels here in Turkey;
for reference, Turkey's southern coast same latitude as SF.)  It would
be great if you two could work together.  I really like Suleyman and if
you could help him get into US market it would be a coup for him.  And,
maybe, you and Jeff will get to Turkey!  By the way (which, by the way,
happens to be Suleyman's favorite transitional phrase] Suleyman very
informal; so don't be afraid to get into an extended dialogue with him,
in which you ask a lot of preliminary questions.   Anyway, it would be
good for his English.

Thinking of you ""up north"" very nice.  Guess the lakes are still socked
in, but beautiful and pristine.  I spent the day in one of Istanbul's
sprawling, slapped together neighborhoods, where a lot of refugees from
the Balkins have settled over the years.  Recently, it was the site of
PKK (i.e. Kurdish] riots.  Wanted to see it.  Impressive bit of
improvising; a testimony to we humans' endless ability to adapt and make
lives for ourselves.  Think about what Istanbul's been through.  In 1970
its population was about 1.5 million.  Now its approaching 15 million,
and most of the new comers are dirt poor folks moving in from the
countryside.  It's slapped together, but works pretty damn well.  Bravo!

I guess a bomb went off nearby and someone was killed.  Always a few
folks looking for the quick reconciliation of irreconcilable, competing
differences.

All the above pretty vague; a writer's dilemma is to make it live for
the reader.  But there's just so much ""stuff"" that makes up any given
piece of reality, and its ultimately in the eye of the beholder anyway.
This is some thing I've set out to try and do; to get my arms around a
bit of everything!  A dwarfing, humbling endeavor; like trying to single
handedly to capture all the water from a ruptured dam.

Texas energy exec says, 'I told you'
POWER CRISIS 
?  Enron's Skilling gets pied before his speech blaming lawmakers, but says he understands Californians' anger 
By Rick Jurgens
TIMES STAFF WRITER



SAN FRANCISCO -- A Texas energy executive who said his warnings were ignored by regulators who restructured California's electricity industry came to the Bay Area on Thursday to say, in effect, ""I told you so."" 
Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp., said that California wouldn't be in its current mess if regulators had followed his advice in 1994 and 1995. 
Regulators erred by forcing wholesale electricity transactions into the spot market so that deals could more easily be monitored, Skilling said in a speech to about 100 people at the Commonwealth Club of California. ""They created a flawed marketplace in the name of regulatory expediency."" 
Enron is a broker that buys and sells contracts to deliver power. Such bilateral transactions shouldn't have been banned, Skilling said. 
Skilling said that's what he said six years ago. 
""I probably made a pest of myself (in the restructuring hearings called by regulators) because I told them they were doing it wrong,"" he said. ""They finally told me to keep quiet."" 
On Thursday night, it was Skilling's turn to be pestered. A woman threw a chocolate pie into his face before the event began. Police said Francine Cavanaugh of Oakland was arrested on suspicion of battery and released. 
Skilling tried to ignore protesters but said he understood why Californians, facing blackouts and rising power costs, were angry. He even had kind words for Gov. Gray Davis, who, he said, ""was dealt a very difficult hand."" 
Skilling became Enron's chief executive in February, replacing company founder Kenneth Lay, an early proponent of electricity deregulation who is close to President Bush. 
Enron, a global energy giant with roots in the natural gas industry, owns some power plants, but its influence in the electricity industry reflects the rapid growth of its energy trading operation. 
Enron's only California generators are small wind facilities. However, the company has developed power plants. Enron initiated two 750-megawatt projects that were sold to Calpine Corp., including a Pittsburg plant due to go online next month. Enron has announced plans to seek regulators' approval for a 750-megawatt power plant in Roseville in Placer County. 
During the first three months of 2001, Enron posted a huge jump in revenue, to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion a year ago, but a much smaller gain in net income, to $425 million from $338 million. Skilling himself cashed an $850,000 paycheck and got a $5.6 million bonus last year. 
But the energy crisis has taken its toll on Enron's stock price and on Skilling, who owned or held options to buy 1.9 million shares of Enron common stock at the time of the company's February proxy filing. At Thursday's closing price of $44.05 a share, the stock was down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high of $90.75 in August. 
That proved that Enron wasn't the villain in California, Skilling said. ""This thing in California has been bad for everybody,"" he said. ""If we had anything to do with this, we're the stupidest people in the world.""

That was my good friend Luca Baldisserri, who is the chief  engineer for Ferrari and won almost everything these past few years with his  driver Michael Schumacher...Luca is likely the best car engineer in the world,  and is interested to join me in the future as a partner to operate a team in the  U.S. based CART ""IndyCar"" series...
 
I invited you both as our sport requires strong corporate  partners to function... and thought you may have interest with knowledge that  you would be working with some of the best people in the world... which would  make it reasonable to achieve a very positive return on any corporate  investment.

Jeff, 
Contract management has become a big issue in most Fortune 1000 companies because of the risk to market capitalization that obligations in corporate contracts pose. I think that Enron executives would be very interested in the articles hot linked below. I would be glad to spend time with your organization to investigate the impact of enabling contract management best practices at Enron.
diCarta provides the first web-based contract and revenue management solution that enables businesses to negotiate, track, manage, and renew contracts via the Internet.  We have had tremendous success in helping companies like Kraft, BEA Systems, Intuit, Agile, Ernst&Young, Deloitte Consulting and many others gain visibility into their contracting and revenue management processes while  mitigating financial and legal risks.
Below is the diCarta solution overview then links to recent articles including our partnerships with Arthur Andersen and Deloitte.
diCarta's Focus:  diCarta Contracts automates your entire contract lifecycle including negotiations, execution, revenue management, maintenance, and renewals on both the sell-side and buy-side.  Your complete contract information will now be in one central location, on-line, for down-stream revenue, obligation, and renewals management.  This is enabled by a direct link of the unstructured data in the contract to structured data, which allows you to take automatic actions based on the actual contract Ts&Cs.  To maximize communication and efficiency, diCarta Contracts was specifically designed to be a collaborative application using role-based security.  E-signatures are supported as well.
Negotiation:  You can negotiate contract Ts&Cs on-line with an internal approval workflow to manage risk.  Not only will you shorten your quote-to-cash cycle, but reduce your legal and financial risk by having on-line visibility into what Ts&Cs you are approving before the contract is executed.  
Revenue Management:  On the sell-side, you will have a framework for revenue recognition per the FASB and SEC guidelines that is driven directly from the contract Ts&Cs.  Now you can manage your revenue recognition risk, significantly reduce labor, and avoid possible non-compliance.  This is extremely important as companies struggle with adherence to SAB 101.  On the buy-side, you can proactively track expenditures.
  
Renewals:  Since all contract Ts&Cs are captured, your renewal process can be completely automated.  Accurate renewal notices linked to the contract can be sent to your customers, vendors, and/or you on a timely basis.

Expect News Conference to last a total of 30 minutes, including Q&A. Jeff 
Skilling will be spokesperson for Selection Committee. However, we will try 
to have as many committee members present as possible. 

Mayor will likely discuss (estimated time = 10 min.):
 - changes that are required at HFD - potential need to bring in an outsider, 
etc...
 - reasoning behind involvement of Enron/Jeff Skilling & formation of 
selection committee - de-politicize the process, etc...

JS should speak about the following (estimated time = 10-15 min.):
 - how he became involved in the process
 - how the committee members were selected
 - who the members are with a brief background on each (We plan to provide a 
bio on each of the committee members as part of the press release)
 - time line for Fire Chief selection 

Q&A (estimated time = 5-10 min.)
 - expect questions along the lines of: Are the meetings going to be open or 
closed?, Outsider vs. Insider related questions...

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments/issues with the above. 
I'll coordinate collection of Bios from Committee members. Anything else I 
can do to help out here?

3552,"I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

Industrials shot up over100 points in the morning and hovered there to close

3564,"I am writing to second all the requests you've probably hearing for money
contributions for Turkey's recovery efforts.  Turkey has a population of
some 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The per
capita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hit
so hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the last
few decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul,
for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago to
what some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today!
Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who moved
from the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life.
The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of the
corner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.

I am sure you have access to trustworthy organizations through which to
distribute your contributions, but in case you don't why not try the

3565,"Jeff/Ken:

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday 
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3 days, 
I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close 
friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some 
politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about 
Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at 
about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading 
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the 
pot. 

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly 
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the 
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also 
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan  
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves 
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will 
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control 
and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been 
discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously 
the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the 
outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with 
MOP on Monday. 

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  
of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already 
done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day 
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation 
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - 
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under 
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to 
move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the 
duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current 
$35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase 
I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry 
of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the 
MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to 
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the 
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the 
current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of 
current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been 
scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.

Regards,

Sanjay"

 Accompanied by the pleasing rat-a-tat-rat of the train wheels slapping the
joints between the rails, we are pulled slowly towards Istanbul.  Adana's (a
city of 1.6 million some 560 miles southeast of Istanbul) cement clutter and
jumbled sprawl are behind us.  It is night now and I imagine this exhausted
land moaning with relief as it is allowed a brief respite until dawn.  Fires
spot the darkened fields -- fields that have been fields longer than any on
this earth.  The silhouettes of men, going about some mysterious chores,
blink out the orange flames from time to time.  I can make out a ragged
black skyline of mountains to the north, scattered before them clumps of
lights marking towns.

Poised above it all, as if balanced by its handle on the palm of some
invisible giant, is the Big Dipper.  The handle points, roughly, in the
direction of Istanbul.  And from the dipper, onto that monstrous city, some
heavenly pap must certainly pour.  Having these last few days traveled
through a tired land full of people beleaguered by poverty, I have new
respect for that ancient town.  Thinking of it now, Istanbul seems imbued
with an almost childlike spunk, and an impressive set of toys with which to
amuse.

 Earlier in the day in Antakya (ancient Antioch, another 120 miles further
southeast of Istanbul), I had just boarded the bus for Adana when a little
girl started saying out loud, to her mother, the names of cities and towns,
some of which she must have seen on road signs.  ""Iskenderun"", ""Adana"", she
pronounced slowly and carefully.  ""Kirikhan"", ""Dortyol,"" she continued.
Then she said ""Istanbul"", with the same care. But it had obviously pleased
her more than the rest, because she repeated it many times, each time with a
bit more zeal, until it finally sounded like a marvelous one-word song.
""Is-stawn-bul, Is-stawn-bul"", she sang out sweetly, her lyric sometimes
punctuated with a short burst of the giggles.  ""Is-stawn-bul!"",
""Is-stawn-bul!""   I doubt I will ever hear or read or say the name again
without hearing her little song.  Even now, I am humming its happy tune.

And you may ask, ""Where was the mother?""  Smiling, I suppose.  And dreaming
of Istanbul.

			Good Friday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

Over the years, we have tried to use this letter for purely business
purposes and not to push any personal agenda. However, now is the time to
make some personal comments.
Everyday, we find it difficult to comprehend what we saw on that fateful
Tuesday morning. The enormity of the what was done, with out regard to life.
Nothing! Who could plan such a thing. Who would! It is hard, very hard,  to
conceptualize what they did. What type of mind would think to do such a
thing. And then have others who would agree that it was a good idea! What
type of people. And the cheering!
We think of our fellow Americans (and others) who perished. And the hero who
gave their lives on the plane and on the ground. We think of the heroes who
did not give their lives.
We think of the friends that we never met! The friends that we now will
never meet. How could humanity do what was done. We think of our business
associate Ira Zaslow, who is missing. Our thoughts are with his family. We
think of all those who lost their lives. We think of their families. Lives
snuffed out by people consumed with hate. And not only lives lost last week.
We think of the missing generations to come. Those generations that will
never be! Oh, the waste - for what!
Rally around America. Rally around Democracy. Rally around what is right!
There is no equivocation about Right and Wrong! Life is sacred! Those who
disregard life, are the ones who will be condemned for eternal damnation!
There, it has been said.

The following comment was written yesterday, but was never sent.
The bottom line is go out, buy stocks and go out and buy in the shops and
malls. And light a candle to never forget!

""The market is very oversold. We are seeing many technical readings similar
to those we saw at  the bottom of the markets in 1987, 1990, 1994 and 1998.
These are very strong signs of market capitulation.  For example the VIX
(volatility) Index is at a peak that is normally seen at market bottoms.
Short Interest is at record levels - a good sign.  Money Market assets (the
amount of cash on hand), is almost equal to 19% of the entire capitalization
of the stock market - a very high degree of liquidity.
The number of market advisors who are negative on the market, is now greater
than the number who are positive on the market - a traditionally bullish
signal.
The PUT/CALL ratio has been very, very high all week - at turnaround
numbers.
The Fed. has reduced rates now 8 times and liquidity in the system is high.
Inflation is low.
Just when the market is NOT expected to rally, it will. That is the nature
of a bottom.
Let's hope that all these technical readings turn the market sooner rather
than later.  Now is the time.""

Natural Gas Peggy Connerty
A Safe Harbor in a Storm
We continue to believe the Master Limited Partnership sector will remain a
safe harbor for
investors as the economy teters on the brink of a recession.
Given the possible recessionary environment, Monday's 50 basis point cut in
the federal funds rate (now
3.0%), and the relatively few alternative investments available, we continue
to be bullish on the MLP
sector.
MLP's in general are defensive in nature, provide income and have decent
growth prospects. The cash
distributions on most MLP's are protected with solid coverage ratios (with
distributable cash averaging
115% of cash distribution). Therefore, we believe the MLP sector should hold
up during this time of
economic and political crisis.
Please refer to our note titled ""Weak Economy, Low Interest Rates Bode Well
for MLP's"" published
September 11, 2001.

PC Software - Microsoft 	Michael Stanek
Trimming Estimates to Match Reality
 Trimming estimates to match reality
 We are cutting our estimates for FY02 from of $28.8B to $27.7B in revs and
EPS from $1.93 to $1.86.
 Microsoft has never been as well positioned as it is today.
Overall we have made the majority of our cuts in the December and balance of
the Q's in '02.
The stock is down in the wake of sliding economic conditions, and
exacerbated this recent tragedy.

Imaging Technology - Eastman Kodak Caroline Sabbagha
Tweaking Revised Estimates
With a little more information and insight, we are tweaking our estimates
for 2001 and 2002. For
FY01, our estimate is now $2.60. For FY02, we are lowering our EPS estimate
to $3.20. We maintain
our 3 Market Perform rating.
We think the issues at Kodak are more than just the economy. They include a
technology transition and
competitive pressures in its traditional businesses.
We are also beginning to get concerned about cashflow and therefore expect
the balance sheet to be
weaker than had been anticipated.
We think the stock should settle in the mid-$30s with the 5% dividend yield
acting as a support for the
stock.

New Media/E-Commerce - Amazon 	Holly Becker
Amazon Update
We expect AMZN, like most retailers, will suffer from the current political
unrest. This leads us to
believe that even the low end of guidance of $625-$675mm in revenues may be
difficult to achieve.
Our 4Q ests. for breakeven operating profits and $900mm in cash hinge on our
4Q sales est. of $1.1 B.
While it is too soon to tell, we will likely need to revisit these ests. in
the upcoming weeks.
About 6 weeks ago, AMZN lowered its book prices by approx. 10%. While this
was likely successful in
increasing demand, the recent catastrophe in the U.S. will obviously offset
the benefits.
On Sept. 11, AMZN announced a 5-yr alliance with Target Corp. in which AMZN
will open a Target store at
Amazon.com later this fall and power all of Target's online sites beginning
in summer 2002.
While financially this agreement will be small, we see several strategic
opportunities, which include
expanding into new categories, enhancing direct vendor relationships and the
possibility of utilizing
Target's physical locations.

New Media/E-Commerce - eBay 	Holly Becker
Well Positioned to Sustain Growth
eBay's business appears to be relatively unscathed by the current political
and economic events.
q On Sept. 18, eBay articulated they are comfortable with 3Q consensus of
$186 mm in rev. and $0.11 EPS
(our ests. are $185 mm in rev. and $0.09 EPS).
eBay's listings dropped 30% on Sept. 11, however, the company expects
listings and sales to recover to
pre-Sept. 11 levels in the next few days. We estimate eBay suffered from 1-2
days of lost sales.
Separately, the company announced ambitious plans to raise $100 mm in 100
days in response to the
recent disaster at the World Trade Center.
Dubbed ""Auction for America,"" the campaign enables sellers to list items on
eBay, with resulting proceeds
to be donated to various relief efforts.
The stock is down over 15% since Sept. 11 and is likely to bounce in the
near term, however we remain
cautious given its still rich valuation.

Semiconductor Capital Equipment - Applied Materials		 Edward
White
Announces Layoffs of ~10% Global Workfor
Industry weakness and the events of last week have forced AMAT to change its
strategy and join
its peers in announcing layoffs. We maintain our 1 Strong Buy rating but are
cautious on the
shares near term, given reduced visibility and the fact that shares are
trading at a premium to
historical trough levels.
In an important change in direction, Applied this morning announced layoffs
of ~2,000 employees, roughly
10% of its global workforce. Layoffs will result in a 4Q01 restructuring
charge of an unspecified amount.
Since the last conference call the economic and semiconductor industry
climate has continued to worsen.
This, along with the traqic events of last week, have left AMAT with zero
visibility. No immediate disruption
in business has occurred, the company does expect some indirect impact.
AMAT remains committed to R&D and Field Support Engineers, and this should
help the company ramp
up quickly in the next upturn.

COMPANY / INDUSTRY UPDATE

Wireline Services - Verizon Communications	 Blake Bath
Achieves PA 271 Approval on Schedule
VZ Achieves 271 PA Approval on Schedule; Opens a $5.5B Market and brings its
total approvals to
4 states (NY, CT, MA, PA). VZ is the clear leader in 271 approvals and has
effectively delivered
versus its public guidance in this regard. 271 entry is expected to add 63
bps to '02 total revenue
growth and 84 bps to '02 growth. LD-entry is a major catalyst for VZ and
current valuations are
cheap in the context of the contributions this catalyst should provide for
the company. Reiterate 1-
Strong Buy.
VZ received 271 approval in PA on 9/19, in line with our forecasts, opening
a $5.5B LD voice/data market
for market.
The company also announced that it expects to file with the FCC for 271
approvals in NJ, NH, VT, and RI
between Nov/Dec '01, putting it on schedule for approvals in these states
between Feb/Mar '02.
In total, the PA approval and the upcoming 4 state approvals are expected to
open a $12.7B market to VZ;
in total, by mid-year '02, we expect VZ to be marketing to a new $33.1B LD
market (within the BEL region);
VZ is the leader in 271 approvals.

NOTES FROM TODAY
Cosmetics; Household & Personal Care - Rayovac 		Ann Gillin Lefever
Discretionary Spending Grinds to a Halt
Rayovac's halved earnings expectations for the current quarter suggest both
that consumer
discretionary spending has ground to a halt; and that the retailer is
battening down the hatches by
postponing (and potentially cancelling) orders to further cut working
capital levels.
As we noted yesterday, consumer staples companies tend to outperform during
periods of economic
stress. However, today's news confirms that those with discretionery
spending exposure are less likely to
participate with strong relative earnings growth. We remain concerned about
Gillette's, Energizer's and
Rayovac's exposure to batteries (where we estimate that discretionery
spending is circa 60% of trend
growth) as well as Gillette's exposure to a razor trade up strategy.
Our earnings estimates for ROV change from $1.28 to $1.03 for FY 01 (Sept.)
and from $1.50 to $1.15 for
FY 02. Our FY 02 estimates are $ 0.10 - $0.15 below management's guidance
due mostly to a more
cautious view on battery category growth. Our target has been reduced to $17
and we maintain our Buy
(2) rating.

Gaming & Lodging - Hilton Group	 Joyce Minor
Company Outlines Post-Attack Outlook
Yesterday, Hilton hosted a conference call to update the investment
community on the state of the
company and its operating outlook subsequent to the terrorist attacks of
September 11th.
Although no specific guidance was given, the company is hoping that poor
travel trends last just 6-
12 weeks, followed by a return to normalized travel trends, albeit at a
level stepped-down to 1998-
1999, not the better 2000 trends. If EPS is a guide, note that 1999 EPS of
$0.60 is -17% below our
pre-attack 2002 EPS estimate. Investors that concur with Hilton's hypothesis
that travel fears will
be short-lived should probably buy the stocks at these levels. For those,
like us, that are
concerned that additional events could prolong or renew travel fears, it may
be too early to check
in to the lodging sector.

Oil & Gas: Exploration & Production Thomas R. Driscoll
Natural Gas Storage
This week's natural gas storage injection of 90 Bcf was slightly stronger
than our 85 Bcf
expectation.
Oil Services & Drilling - Tidewater James Crandell
Lowering Fiscal 2002 and 2003 EPS Estima
The moderating activity in the Gulf of Mexico is negatively impacting
Tidewater's earnings more
than we previously expected. We continue to believe that improving
international activity and the
start-up of new vessel contracts will partially offset this domestic
moderation. Given that the stock
is currently 50% below its current-cycle high and trading at attractive
levels on anticipated
earnings and cash flow, we believe that the stock is attractively valued at
current levels.
We are again lowering our fiscal 2002 and 2003 earnings estimates to $2.45
(from $2.65) and to $2.65
(from $2.95) to reflect lower-than-expected domestic vessel utilisation
which will lead to downward
pressure on day rates. This follows a earnings reduction last week.
We believe that domestic utilisation will remain weak over the next four
quarters.
Domestic day rates have remained steady to-date but will likely start to
erode in the fourth quarter.

Power - NRG Daniel Ford
NRG Reaffirms Earnings Expectations
We continue to believe that NRG is the most defensive investment in the
IPP/Merchant Sector. We
maintain our Strong Buy with a $23 price target.
In light of last week's tragedy and continued market skittishness regarding
power supply fundamentals in
front of negative GDP predictions, NRG management issued a release to
reconfirm its $1.35 EPS
guidance for 2001 followed by 25% annual growth in 2002 and beyond.
Further management indicated that it terminated its efforts to close on the
Wisvest acquisition (1051MW)
due to insurmountable regulatory hurdles.
We continue to be confident in our 2001 and 2002 EPS estimates for NRG of
$1.40 and $1.78 given
management's conservative and disciplined business approach. This has
enabled the company to time
and time again stand by earnings expectations despite the ever changing
market fundamentals.

Power Daniel Ford
Electric Utilities and Power Weekly
We are previewing the events of the upcoming week of September 24, 2001
We look for the New Jersey BPU to approve the FirstEnergy/GPU merger on
September 26. We also
provide a list of some potential post-merger closing international asset
divestitures.
Parties in New Jersey could submit testimony regarding the Potomac Electric
(POM, Market Perform;
$21.77)/Conectiv (CIV, Market Perform, $23.05) merger proceeding early next
week.

Power - DTE Energy Gregg Orrill
Another Good Yield Hog Story
As an integrated utility with a 4.8% yield, DTE should do well in a
recessionary backdrop. Below
we review the DTE outlook and reiterate our $48 price target which is 11.25x
our 2002E.
DTE is well positioned to do well in the current environment with a
traditional utility focus, a stock buyback
authorization, and a short power position.
DTE had $150M left on the current stock buyback plan and a lingering 10M
share authorization.
Industrial sales are down 10% Y-T-D. However, the lower margin earned on
these customers and DTE's
short position make this a positive impact on the company.
Offsetting factors include lower pension income and outlook for Plug Power.
We reiterate our EPS estimates of $3.54/$4.26 for 2001/2002 respectively.
The MCN acquisition and fuel
cost timing weight more income to Q4 vs. Q3. We look for $0.40-$0.50 in Q3
and $1.60-$1.70 for Q4.

Power Technology - Thomas ONeill
CT DPUC Draft Draws a Blank
CT DPUC releases draft decision that denies FCEL 26MW project entirely.
Reducing shares of
FCEL to Market Perform from Strong Buy due to lack of material catalysts and
potential downside
to $8/share.
Late Wednesday, the CT DPUC issued a draft decision that denied funding to
an ENE/CRRA proposal that
would have resulted in a 26MW order for FuelCell Energy.
While the draft decision could be adjusted to provide funding in a final
decision (early Oct), the wording of
the order appears to point the companies towards additional state funding
vehicles, which would likely take
multiple months to tap and would be speculative at this point.
We believe the disappointing CT DPUC draft decision leaves shares vulnerable
to the downside ($8/share)
and likely caught in a lower trading range until sub MW and MW ""launch size""
order flow can be generated.
That said, FCEL's $7/share of fully diluted cash and leadership in carbonate
technology should limit
downside even in the current market environment.

Banks - First Virginia Banks Kristin Nemec
3Q01 Preview
Although credit experience has been excellent we remain cautious in our
outlook due to the
consumer exposure and lower than average net income growth. FVB is rated
3-Market Perform.
We carry an operating estimate of $0.78, in line with consensus. No change
in our estimates of $3.10 and
$3.35 for 2001 and 2002, respectively.
The balance sheet dynamic is driven by management's decision to pull back in
the indirect auto business
by simply pricing less aggressively. Due to a pullback of many competitors
and the rate environment, we
believe spreads have widened in the indirect business.
We expect the near term expense progression to be minimal.

Banks - Bank One Henry Chip Dickson
Third Quarter Preview
We continue to rate ONE 3 - Market Perform. The deteriorating economic
environment should
cause further downward earnings revisions for ONE, as well as pushing out
the inflection point
when the company really begins to establish EPS momentum. We are also
reducing our target
price $5 to $35.
Given the deteriorating economic environment, we are reducing our estimates
for ONE - assuming higher
credit costs and modestly lower levels of revenue.
For 3Q01, we expect ONE to report $0.60 during the week of October 15. This
represents a reduction of
$0.04 from our previous estimate.
For 2001, we are lowering our estimate $0.10 to $2.40. For 2002, we are
lowering our estimate $0.15 to
$2.75. New GAAP EPS should be $0.03 - $0.04 higher in 2002. We do believe
our 2001 estimate is on
the conservative side.


Biotechnology Joseph Dougherty
Discovery Collaboration with Takeda
The agreement calls for the development of small molecule leads against a
target proprietary to
Takeda. We view this deal as a significant positive for Array, featuring
both excellent deal
structure and potential for future expansion.
This is Array's 4th significant collaboration in the past 2 months that is
tied to potential downstream
revenue participation. We point out to investors that company management had
guided us to expect a
total of 3 royalty-based deals by the end of September, and this
announcement points to possible upside
to our numbers.
We note that Array's shares have sold off more severely than the biotech
group overall, although not to the
extent of some of their competitors. We believe the shares are very
attractive at these levels.

Biotechnology - ImClone Systems Michael Wood
IMCL Signs Strategic Agreement w/BMY
Deal with Bristol Myers will provide $1.0 billion in cash and access to
world class oncology
franchise.
ImClone announced that it has signed a major strategic partnership with
Bristol Myers to commercialize its
lead drug IMC-C225.
ImClone will receive $1.0 billion in upfront and milestone payments. Bristol
Myers will take responsibility for
sales and marketing and will pay ImClone a royalty on net sales.
We are changing our EPS forecasts from ($1.03) loss to ($0.91) loss in 2001,
from ($0.46) loss to $0.16 in
2002, from $0.41 to $0.88 in 2003 and from $1.41 to $1.54 in 2004. We are
instituting a new EPS estimate
of $2.05 in 2005. These latter numbers are fully taxed.
Lehman Brothers acted as financial advisor to Bristol Myers in connection
with this transaction.

Major Pharmaceuticals - Lilly, Eli Charles Butler
SOLD! Oritavancin Out-Licensed to ITMN
Yesterday, LLY announced that InterMune had acquired worldwide rights to
oritavancin, late-stage
Phase III compound under development for complicated skin infections and
bacteremia. We had
anticipated a potential 2004 launch for this compound, thus we are not
changing any near term
revenue or earnings estimates.
The agreement provides InterMune with exclusive worldwide rights to develop,
manufacture and
commercialize oritavancin.
We understand from LLY that NPV analysis supported the licensing of
oritavancin to another party versus
the continued development of this molecule internally.
Additionally, LLY's stable of late stage compounds is extensive. Arguably,
""licensing oritavancin to
InterMune will allow LLY to maximize the full potential of this innovative
compound while the company
redirects its internal resources to other late-stage pipeline opportunities

Health Care Facilities - 	Tenet Healthcare 	Adam Feinstein
Lehman Key Takeaways
THC pre-announced last night that it will exceed est for the recently
completed Aug qtr with a
suggested EPS range of $0.65-$0.67 range, vs our est of $0.63 and the street
consensus of $0.61.
Tenet continues to benefit from accelerating revenue growth trends, improved
cashflow generation, and
debt reduction initiatives.
We note that this news was widely expected by us, as well as others for the
past several weeks. However,
the magnitude of the upside was above our estimate.
The catalyst for this announcement was a desire to repurchase shares under
its share repurchase
program.
We are raising our FY '02 est to $2.83 from $2.80 and we are upticking our
FY '03 est to $3.30 from $3.24.

Autos & Auto Parts - Visteon Corp Darren Kimball
Pre-Announces 3Q01 EPS
VC pre-announced 3Q01 EPS of -$0.46 to -$0.53, compared to our previous
estimate of $0.05,
prompted by Ford's recently announced third quarter production cancellation
of 100,000-120,000
units. This large earnings shortfall implies a steep variable contribution
margin from lost Ford
revenues, estimated at 35%, which is not particularly surprising given the
sudden and dramatic
nature of the production cuts.
For the time being, we are lowering our 2001 EPS estimate from $0.95 to
$0.40 and our 2002 EPS
estimate from $1.40 to $0.95. The potential for additional Ford production
cuts in 4Q01 may lead us to trim
estimates further.
VC's high degree of earnings sensitivity to production volumes, resulting
from the supplier's substantial
operating leverage and depressed margins, makes it one of the most
vulnerable automotive suppliers to a
protracted economic slowdown.

Business & Professional Services - 	Cintas 	dam Waldo
Soft F1Q02; Cutting F2002 and F2003 Est
On September 19, CTAS reported F1Q02 (ended August) revenue of $564.6
million (up 8.2% and, we
estimate, 5.7% organically) relative to our forecast of a 10.5% rise on a
reported basis and an 8%
gain organically. EPS of $0.33 rose 10.6%, $0.01 below our estimate and
in-line with Street
consensus.
F1Q02 marked Cintas' the third straight quarter of decelerating top line
gains in a slowing U.S. economy.
CTAS' two principal drivers of the velocity of top line growth are the pace
of GDP and employment growth,
both of which continue to soften.
Trading at 28 times our new fiscal 2002 EPS of $1.44, 31 times our fiscal
2002 free cash flow forecast, and
a trailing EV/EBITDA ratio of 14.3 times (private market value range of
7-11), we think CTAS is fully valued
despite a ""defensive"" 60% recurring revenue model.
With management following strategies for longer-term shareholder value
creation (nicely improving internal
unit growth, unit pricing, and capital efficiency), we would be buyers in
the low $30s.

Electrical Equipment -	 W.W. Grainger 		Robert Cornell
Review GWW's August '01 Sales/Outlook
Branch Margins Still The Key
q Grainger's August sales were off modestly, but did not weaken
significantly beyond July sales trends.
North American economic weakness continues to impact sales while seasonal
sales improved.
Branch saw moderate sales decrease. Company helped by diversified customer
base. Management
maintains margin targets.
q Digital sales continues to improve to $460 million annualized run rate.
Grainger.com increased run rate to
$350 million.
We are maintaining our 2001 EPS estimate of $2.25 and 2002 EPS forecast of
$2.70, which suggests a
20% gain. Price target at $50.

Electrical Equipment -	 SPX Corp 	Robert Cornell
Our 2002 earnings number remains $7.50
Stock looks oversold at current levels
SPX's INRANGE subsidiary guides revenues down and points to a potential $4
million in freight forwarding
costs.
Worst case scenario looks to be a $0.15 impact to SPX's 3Q01 earnings.
Cost cutting initiatives as well as United Dominion integration savings
could help support bottom line
results.
We are maintaining our $6.50 2001 EPS estimate and our $7.50 2002 EPS
forecast.

Machinery -	 Caterpillar 		Joel Tiss
Still Waiting...
CAT shares have declined over 20% during the past few weeks from $56, yet we
are still waiting
patiently to buy trying to minimize downside risk.
It is difficult to ascertain if recent events will change the long term
construction trends as economic
weakness may accelerate potentially setting up recovery in late 2002-03.
Government construction
spending should remain strong.
Downside risk in shares remains $30. We would be much more interested in
buying below $40 and would
become more aggressive in the low to mid $30's. However, nibbling in the low
to mid $40's may not be the
worst idea.
Believe upside stock potential remains $65-70, mid decade, based on $6.50
peak EPS - however timing of
peak earnings is more of a question than levels.

Advertising & Marketing Services Kevin Sullivan
Global ad stocks continue to come under pressure following last week's
attacks on ""Old Glory"".
The sell-off creates a compelling investment opportunity among the stronger
names such as
Omnicom.
Last week's events came at a difficult time for media stocks -- the ad
market was still weak and consumer
and business confidence was rocked -- both key elements in the resurgence of
industry growth.
Consensus estimates have become that much more challenging. For the ad
holding companies, we
believe the near-term impact is minimal since the vast majority of the
group's revenues are fee-based.
However, the potential for additional pullbacks in ad spending further
supports our belief of downside risk
in 4Q/'02 estimates.
Valuations have largely already adjusted for this risk, in our view. Our
favorite name continues to be OMC,
which is trading at less than 9x our '02 EBITDA estimate. The stock appears
to be discounting the worst
and we would recommend investors use the weakness as an opportunity to
accumulate positions.

Entertainment - 	Disney 		Stuart Linde
Keeping It All in Perspective-Balancing
We believe that at current levels, Disney encapsulates most of the downside
risk of the U.S.
recession and the terrorism threat. As opposed to its peers, Disney has the
added risk of a decline
in domestic and international travel to its theme parks.
About 80% of the company's EBITDA is generated by theme parks and
broadcasting. The theme parks are
about 40% of DIS' annual EBITDA. In 1991, theme park EBITDA dropped 30%.
We believe the studio and consumer divisions could offset some of the loss.
The studio will be bolstered by
releases such as Monsters Inc., (in Nov.) and continuing DVD sales propelled
by the Platinum Collection.
In this difficult period people need entertainment and fantasy especially of
the wholesome, uplifting,
signature Disney genre.
While the stock has begun to discount lower 2002 expectations. Investors are
looking to identify downside
support for ent. cos such as DIS. In our sensitivity analysis, we have used
a trough multiple of 10x and
varied EBITDA by $200 MM increments. If we assume EBITDA declines 20% to $4
Bil, the trough on the
stock using this analysis is $15.

			Good Friday Afternoon - Comments From The Local
Guys!

Today's employment number was not a good one - however, it should prompt the
Fed to be more aggressive. The unemployment rate was the worst part of the
report, jumping to 4.9%. The market had been looking for 4.7% unemployment.
The jump in the unemployment rate was bad, but we have to remember two
things. First, the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator of economic
conditions. Second, with revisions, the payroll number  was only slightly
worse than consensus. That said, the drop in aggregate hours of  -0.4%  and
the confidence impact of the jump in the unemployment rate will likely
result in lower GDP growth in the 3rd and 4th quarters than we were
anticipating. Lehman Brothers' economists now look for third quarter GDP of
1.0% (previous. 2.0%) and fourth quarter growth of 2.0% (previous. 3.0%). In
addition they now expect the Federal Reserve to cut  50 basis points at the
October 2nd meeting and expect a further 25 bp cut at the November 6th
meeting. The unemployment rate is now at its highest level since September
1997. But remember: The unemployment rate is a lagging indicator of economic
conditions.


The 30 -year bond yield is 5.38%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.79%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.28%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.92 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $2.48 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the

*In our view, AOL Time Warner remains THE premier integrated media company
with a uniquely valuable portfolio of assets. Its
core businesses offer investors superior earnings power and growth while its
new transformational initiatives should propel the
company's long-term growth rate to above industry norms. The stock remains
the most attractive long term holding in our universe.
*However, we continue to believe that near term performance of the stock
will be held back by the softness in the advertising market
and the resulting lack of earnings visibility. Current estimates are calling
for a significant acceleration in revenue growth (especially

*Generally credited with driving the early growth of the cable industry,
almost 30 years later, HBO continues to find new subscribers,
build viewership and increase cash flow at double-digit rates.
*As a premium service, HBO is not at the mercy of the ups and downs of the
advertising cycle, but rather enjoys an annuity-like
stream of (monthly)subscription revenues, providing a stabilizing influence
to the financial performance of the Networks group as a
whole.
*HBO is expected to generate significantly above trend cash flow results
this year due to fundamental strength in the business as well
as one-time benefits from cost-cutting and merger synergies.
*HBO enjoys tremendous operating leverage--margins are continually expanding
because of the per subscriber leverage on costs.
*Quality original programming, an unparalleled movie line-up and
multiplexing are the cornerstones of HBO's growth.

Rank 2 2
*Cable is a bedrock of financial stability for AOL Time Warner. It
consistently generates mid-teens EBITDA growth and should
begin generating significant amounts of free cash flow by 2002.
*Cable creates incremental value through new services such as digital and
high-speed data, secures value for cable programming at
AOL networks and will serve as the platform for the next generation of
convergent services such as VOD, IP-based telephony,
interactive TV and home networking.
*For 2001, we are expecting revenue growth of 14% to $6.9 billion and EBITDA
growth of 15% to $3.3 billion. Over the next five
years, we anticipate TWC will maintain compound annual revenue growth of
12-13% and EBITDA growth of 15%.
*While Cable is one of the segments with the most short-term upside
potential due to very strong demand for broadband services, we
are concerned about the declining trend in basic subscriber growth and the
lack of studio support for VOD via cable.
Gaming & Lodging J. Minor, .617.342.4120
Near-Term Caution, Lowering Lodging Estimates & Targets
*Given weaker than expected July and August results, we are lowering our
2H01 lodging estimates. Our estimates conservatively
assume the current weakness continues throughout 3Q01 and 4Q01, as we've
heard no signs of strengthening. Further we now expect
a slower rebound, and have revised our 2002 RevPAR growth forecasts to 1%-2%
from 3%-4%. As a result, we have lowered our
2002 estimates by 5% to 10% or so, putting us below consensus by a similar
amount. We have lowered our price targets on our
lower estimates. While the stocks are already down 10% since the news of the
worse than expected weakness, we think near-term
caution is warranted as the group could remain choppy as estimates decline.
We continue to like the group for the demand recovery
scenario, we just see it as further out.

*We are reiterating our 1 Strong Buy rating on XL Capital at the beginning
of what we expect will be a pivotal month for reinsurance
prices. XL Capital is the only large-cap insurer with the lion's share of
its revenues generated by reinsurance and, therefore, purchase
of XL Capitals shares is the best way for large-cap investors to benefit
from rising reinsurance prices. During the week of September
10, the reinsurance world will convene at the annual Rendez-Vous de
Septembre in Monte Carlo, France. This is the event where
reinsurers, brokers, and reinsurance customers begin their discussions about
reinsurance prices for the important January 1, 2002
renewals. Since approximately 55% of all reinsurance is priced for January 1
effective dates, the pricing commentary that is
generated by this conference is key to the reinsurance industrys
profitability. Based on discussions with reinsurers and insurers we
expect the Monte Carlo conference will affirm that the reinsurance industry
will experience another year of price firming with prices
increases at least as much as last January, or at least 15%-20%.

OCTAVE is a trial in hypertension and has concluded.
Data should be available this month or next. OVERTURE is a trial in
congestive heart failure. It's conclusion is sometime next year.
*Cardiology contacts for whom we have spoken to yesterday indicate that BMY
are asking investigators of the OVERTURE trial to
""switch all patients over to Vanlev in January"". This implies that the
number of events in the trial is sufficient to potentially draw a
conclusion (end the trial) maybe in time for the Spring heart meetings (ACC
in March). Further, it may imply that BMY believe
Vanlev is safe enough to switch ALL patients over to the drug, and perhaps
(though only a postulate) the efficacy in a sufficient
population of patients is at least as good if not better than the placebo
ACE inhibitor lisinopril. Our peak sales remain $1.5 billion for
this drug as these comments increase in our minds the probability of success
of this drug in heart failure.

    After seeing my first son pledge Phi Sig at Georgia Tech 6 years ago,
then my second boy pledge UCLA baseball four years ago, it is with great
pride I announce that young Joe Berry  just accepted a bid to become a
member of Beta Theta Pi at Auburn University.  He called me tonight with the
news and it is just sinking in as I type this.  I figured it would be the
last thing he would do, due to his persistent individualism all his life.
It's a really neat feeling to have a son as a Beta.  Very difficult to
describe.  Thank God I'm a Beta and I hope to be a better one.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow


PS.  He first told me he had pledged Sigma Chi, his pledge class was 47, but
only 30 expect to make it through, that 3 of the actives are known
homosexuals, one of his pledge brothers is a midget, that pledge football
practices are at 5:30 a.m. (mandatory) and he would have to drop one of his
classes to get through pledgeship.  I pretty much bought all of it until the
dropping of the class bit.  Guess Joe has been paying attention all along to
the concept of the Beta Dick.

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our commercial and real estate business.

Jeff,
 
Congratulations!--on  your amazing successes and your uncanny ability to make good  decisions.  I've always held you in the highest regard for being the  smartest person I ever worked with.  I'm certain it's been a tough few  weeks as you wrestled with your choice.  In a small way I can relate and if  others were willing to speak out you would find that you're far from  alone.
 
Nine years ago this  month you and I met in McKinsey's Dallas office to discuss my role with  Enron upon its acquisition of Access.  I maintained that my  employment agreement must have an escape clause to prevent me from being  transferred to Houston.  You were understandably surprised and  suggested that my career opportunities would be limited if I stayed in  Dublin.  Having recently been divorced I knew that if I left the city  where my then 14 and 15 year old sons lived with their mother I would  never be able to continue the father/sons relationship which was so  important to me.  When I met with Ken Lay a few weeks later, he too  seemed surprised that I wasn't going to join the management team in  Houston.
 
I don't know what  might have happened in my career had I not made that choice.  Perhaps  the politics in Houston would have done me in since I was truly a small  company entrepreneur.  But, when I compare myself to my then  peers, Lou, Mark, Ken and later Cliff, Andy and Kevin, I do  believe I was/am their intellectual equal.  Thus, I may have paid  an extremely high financial price for my personal choice.  Regrets?   On the contrary, my ex-wife moved away so I actually was able to raise my  sons, both of whom are doing great (One graduated from Washington University and  lives in San Francisco and the other graduates from Florida State this  December).  I also wouldn't have ended up with Sue and gained four more  kids.  I adopted the youngest--now nearly 11.  I also watched the  births of my two grandchildren and my step-son is trading emissions for  Enron.  
 
So, I react to  your decision with respect and admiration.  I really learned from Sue,  whose workaholic late husband died at 42, that life truly is too short.   We're enjoying ours and I hope you will too.  But, with only one child  left at home we're ready to move to warmer climes.  If you decide to change  the world again, even if on a smaller scale this time, and would like some help,  give me a call.  Best of luck.
 
Regards,
 
Lance"

Jeff,
 
On Saturday, September 29th, I am being honored with the National Multiple Sclerosis  Society's Hope  Award during their  annual Maxine Mesinger Dinner of  Champions event.  This award is beinggiven to me due to the hard work and  dedication that BMC Software  employees have shown this great cause through the years.  I understand that you were the recipient of this award last year, so you know  that the key to a successful event is the selection of the dinner  committee, which is then used to  build the invitation list and to build excitement for attending the event from  local leaders.  Of course, the  key to successfully developing the dinner committee is the selection of the  Chairman of the committee.
 
I would be honored  if you would agree to serve as the Chairman of the dinner committee.  You were  the first name that came to mind and the best person I could hope for to assure  a successful event. I am told that your personal time commitment would be  very minimal.  It would require your attendance at the dinner event on  September 29th in downtown Houston.  The dinner is typically from 7:00pm until 10:00pm,but the actual ceremony is less  than 30 minutes long with some brief comments by you and then an acceptance  speech given by yours truly.  The primary obligation beyond attending the  event would be to allow us to use your name and signature in sending out the  invitations to the dinner committee members.  I would provide you with a  recommended invitation list. The MS team would make sure that  your time and image would be well respected.
 
Thank you Jeff,

A.  I saw you speak at the Tibco conference in Las Vegas and I was inspired.  I've been at Enron for over 5 years, and I think it's fantastic that we using the 'strategy' word more and more.

B. I stole your slides and re-used them for my own purposes.  I hope you don't mind.

C. I think I can see how to move forward with our technology team to build the kind of systems ""structure"" that goes some way to mimicking the capabilities inherent in your new business structure. 

I thought you might enjoy thumbing through ""my"" slides and notes.

Technology spending soared in the 1990s, amid a booming economy and the dual promise and threat of the Internet. But the binge is over and - billions of dollars later - technology leaders now face uncertain returns on those investments. 
The Forrester Technology Leadership Forum will focus on incremental investments that will help you achieve payoff from your firm's technology assets. The key is Web services technologies, which help companies build and link systems within and between organizations, regardless of location or platform. Web services deliver real benefits; they lower integration and connection costs, improve productivity, and foster more agile partnerships, while preserving the value of legacy IT systems. Forrester analysts will tell you how you can use Web services today to differentiate and accelerate growth. You'll also hear from leaders at vendor and user companies that are creating and deploying best-in-class Web services.

relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

3595,"Gentlemen

I just spoke to Jeff who had just finished his phone call with Dorman (ATT).  Jeff said that Dorman was very interested in our proposal and even had some ideas on expanding the scope of our ideas.  He said that Dorman would like to get together on Weds.  June 6 in Washington DC to continue the discussions.  I'm not quite sure what this means except that it appears that Dorman does have a genuine interest in exploring a big deal with EBS.  So I would recommend that we get together early next week with Jeff and maybe with the Adventis guys and prepare for the 6/6 meeting.  

Ken"
3596,"Lou,

per my conversations with several of your folks in Enron last week, i would
like to see if we could do a short call to debrief on your and our

3598,You guys did a terrific job on the Frontline program last night  
3599,"Jeff:

The whole team and I very much enjoyed our meeting with you last Friday.  We were looking forward to having the opportunity to tell you all about the progress of our business.  We felt that the give and take and the dialogue during the course of the meeting was excellent, and we hope that in the future we will be able to have useful dialogues like this at appropriately periodic intervals.

To memorialize the follow-up steps from this, we thought it would be useful to write this down so we may remain responsive to your questions regarding our progress.

	1.	We want to confirm the reasonableness of our net churn numbers; we plan to develop a fact base of churn experience over the course of the next few months and analyze these compared to the original business case model.  We would be prepared to review this churn with you in about three months.

	2.	To analyze the rationale of our hedging of long term contracts against the ""disaster"" of falling prices; this is to be done against the assumption that our customers will leave us on the basis of strict economic rationality. We believe that providing this type of analysis would be very useful for us as we enter the year 2002 where power and gas prices will be substantially different next year than they are now.  We would be prepared to review the results of this analysis with you in the fall.

	3.	Decompose our net cash burn to indicate the ""levers"" to reduce that cash burn against unforeseen problems/disasters.  We would plan to do this as part of our normal budgeting process for 2002. We would plan to review this with our Board in our fall meeting. We believe that it is the right course of activity to review this with the Board and then follow up with you if there are any questions going forward.  We also believe that there could be an opportunity to review the cash burn significantly given the fact that a large part of our cash burn is spent on systems development for entry into specific markets.

Jeff, as I said in the beginning, we very enjoyed meeting with you and we hope that we were able to prove to you that we have made substantial progress.  I would like to feel that I will have the opportunity to get in touch with you at key juncture intervals during the development of our company.

Thanks again for your time.

3600,"On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding ""Peer Group Mapping"".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

3604,"     Hello Sukran and Mark;
     Welcome back to Turkey.
      I hope the weath weather is better in Turkey than here as it has been
cold for spring.  Temps in the 50's during the day and while we have had some
sunny days there has been plenty of rain.  I have been busy with my Golden
""K"" Club (Senior Citizen Kiwanis).  We help with a picnic for mentally
retarded children, read to needy preschool children, help at mentally
retarded track meet, go to weekly meetings and etc.  I am told May is the
busiest month and it has been but it is almost finished.
     Mother and I have been watching the weather in Italy and imagining what
the two of you are doing.  Sue is back and catching up on their business.
This week besides Foundry work they have Visited an honorary dinner for one
of Jeff's college professors.   They are also doing some major work  on their
house.   The Sweeps are over at WGN-TV for a while so now Tom is looking
forward to his trip to Alaska a week from Thursday.  Jeff is still busy with
the gas problems so we hear little from him.  I hear Peter Widman is getting
married.  Though nothing definite I hear it will be in the fall.
     Nothing else for now.  Let us hear from you.   In the meantime  WE SEND
BOTH OF YOU  LOTS of LOVE and KISSES    MOTHER and DAD"
3605,"Help us with inaugurate our first-time finish tent in Austin (as big as regulations allow due to the space available).   It is there that you will get your finish prize which will add some real value to the pain and suffering of your two-day trek in addition to making you the envy of your neighborhood.   

Amy Moore, our Austin volunteer lead, will have been there since Saturday to make sure you get your fill of beer, soft drinks and junk food, which is just what most of us want at that point.

If you're hungrier than that, Hooter's is serving dinner to everyone with a wrist-band.

Reminder:  If you're riding the bus back to Houston, drop your bike first, and then celebrate.  Average time for bike transport to Houston after the drop is 5 hours, and it would be good to get the bike there before you.

When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage 
until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not 
currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have 
obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at 
orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?

3617,"We need to work out a system here Kristen.  Why is it you are so freakin hard 
to get in touch with?  I asked you how often you check email, but you've 
never told me, once a day, week, what?  And this cell phone thing...Do you 
have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check 
voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from 
you?  I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from 
you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.  

Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with 
Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.

"
3619,"David,

This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is 
almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California 
ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated 
scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table 
with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned 
or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity 
of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did 
which lists each plant and the outage for ""today"" and let's say 1 week in the 
past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that 
day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total ""Planned"" and 
""Unplanned"" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know 
when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.

instead of looking away, I smiled at him.  So when he got up to get off, he
asks me if I like cinnamon rolls.  I said no. And he said I will bring you
some tomorrow and then I said awesome.  Now, I have to take the earlier bus
so I won't have to see him.  This girl who I am friends with was sitting

Since the group meetings are now scheduled for today and I do not want to move the interviews again, you will be conducting the interviews and making recomendations on who to hire.  Here is the schedule:

All three of us will interview Milen and Grzegorz at 2:00 and 2:30.
Tara & Mat will interview Mohit and Guilherme at 3:00 and 3:30.
All three of us will interview Jenny on Thursday at 2:30.

Make sure their English and technical (Excel/Database) skill are sufficient.  If you would like, we can talk briefly about what to ask the candidates.  We will meet Thursday afternoon to make a decision.

More was accomplished at the conference than I expected.  Note that a follow-up conference is tentatively scheduled for August 28.  I think the full requirements customers have finally gotten the message that they will have to accept some defined level of service.  It was also clear that El Paso does not have sufficient capacity to serve everybody's full load all the time and they will have to, at the least, credit demand charges when they cannot serve their firm shippers, and may even be required to expand their system.

Enron is attempting to reconcile the daily activities of each counterparty with us. This includes when each counterparty cut us, and schedules that were moved. To facilitate these efforts please put all cuts and scheduling sheets in the accordion file on the RT overflow desk (where Kate used to sit).

Also, stay tuned for new information on EPE. Apparently the information communicated by Tony was not completely correct.

SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

1. The discount rate shall apply to points utilized by the original shipper 
??????? entering into the transportation agreement with Northwest. 

2. A shipper will be allowed to release and/or segment and release the 
capacity 
and shipper and replacement shipper may utilize any available points on 
Northwest's transmission system without impacting the discount for the 
original shipper. 

3. This prearranged offer is for a reservation contract demand rate.? In 
addition 
to the Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the volumetric charge, the 
applicable surcharges and fuel. 



PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation 
capacity for electronic bid (""package or packages""): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available transportation capacity under the specified package OR 
multiple 
rates can be submitted each for a partial amount of available transportation 
capacity under the specified package.? If the same Shipper submits multiple 
bids, 
the highest present value for such package of available transportation 
capacity 
shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids from the same Shipper for 
the 
same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is 
??????? less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? 
Bid Rate x 
??????? FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or 
if the 
??????? maximum rate is bid, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x 
FERC Interest 
??????? Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100. In case of a tie, each 
tied shipper 
??????? will have the right to improve its bid by submitting an improved bid 
within 24 
??????? hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall be faxed to 
(801) 584-7076 
??????? to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still exists, such 
capacity shall 
??????? be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than 
??????? indicated for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

Latest NFL Player News 

Patrick Jeffers  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Texas Terminators Updated 10/26/01 
Jeffers hopes to return to the field for the first time in 14 months when the Panthers play host the New York Jets on Sunday. Jeffers, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been told by the coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first time this season. ""They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing like I will be,"" Jeffers said. ""I'm excited. It's another step along the way."" Keep Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited action if plays. 

Ryan Leaf  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has been named the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Stoerner will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who is out with a chronic sprained knee and could face season-ending surgery. We wouldn't advise using Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. He has played just three games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2 quarterback for Dallas. 

Edgerrin James  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=133320&>, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/26/01 
James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine for the Colts' next game on November 4. 

Derrick Alexander  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1191&>, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01 
Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets. 

James Hodgins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=146331&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy. 

Dave Stachelski  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=187759&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards. 

Michael Bennett  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01 
Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week. 

Todd Heap  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week. 

Anthony Thomas  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235248&>, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/25/01 
Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Kevin Swayne  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1677&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy. 

Dedric Ward  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot injury. 

Terry Allen  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/25/01 
Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive. 

Jason Brookins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/25/01 
Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Shannon Sharpe  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01 
Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Freddie Jones  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1843&>, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/25/01 
Jones has a sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as questionable on the injury report. 

Hines Ward  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Ward missed practice Wednesday because of a foot injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as probable. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01 
Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game. 

Charlie Batch  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12204&>, QB DET - Blue Balls Updated 10/25/01 
Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals. 

O.J. McDuffie  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury. 

Terrence Wilkins  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs. 

Jerome Pathon  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01 
Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup. 

Terry Glenn  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday. 

Drew Bledsoe  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1041&>, QB NE - Dont Mess Updated 10/25/01 
The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills. 

Chad Morton  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=187613&>, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain. 

Marco Battaglia  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1324&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit. 

Chad Johnson  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=235222&>, WR CIN - Really Rottens Updated 10/25/01 
Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/25/01 
Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy. 

Tyrone Wheatley  <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=1968&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/25/01

Hello, I hope you had a good flight back to Texas.  Thank you very much for your visit to the Denver location - I found it very informative.  

I faxed over travel profiles to your office for the Enron North America, Denver employees.  I am now requesting the right to make travel using ""ClickTrip"" on behalf of the employees in our office:  Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci, Theresa Staab, and Tyrell Harrison.  Please set me, Heidi DuBose, up as their travel arranger.

Thank you again for the meeting,

Sincerely,
Heidi DuBose

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

3734,"Hello to all!

Here is the promised email address book. ?There are still people missing, but 
it's a pretty good start. ?I will volunteer to be the keeper of the master 
list for a while, and will send out updates monthly or when needed to 
everyone. ?If there is anyone missing from the email list or something needs 
to be changed, please send it to me. ?If I should ever go back to work, I 
will find a volunteer in the family to be the master keeper of the list.  I 
did receive an error on Vern, Brad and Greg when sending this email.  
Hopefully someone can send me their correct email address.

I put this address book together to accomplish two things. ?First, I am 
writing a family cookbook so I need to be able to communicate individually 
with all of you. ?More on that later. ?Second, this should give the guys 
putting together the next reunion a little easier way to correspond with the 
family rather that having to mail to everyone. ?This way they only have to 
mail to those not on the list.

Now, for what this list is not for. ?This is not for any of you to send group 
emails for jokes and cartoons, or chain letters. ?Some of the people on this 
list have given work email addresses. ?They cannot receive improper emails 
(especially if you work for the ATF). ?If any of you do start receiving 
unwanted emails, please let that person know immediately to stop. ??If they 
do not stop, please let me know and we will remove them from the family email 
list. ?

Thanks to all of you that helped me to get this information.  I am still 
working on getting more addresses, so let me know if you have any.

For those of you that haven't heard this yet, I am trying to write a family 
cookbook.  I am hoping to get the recipes for everything our parents used to 
make for us while we were growing up.  I also want to get three or four of 
your own favorite recipes from each cousin.  There will be other nice tidbits 
in the cookbook about everyone, maybe a story from when you were growing up?  
Or even something current in your life.  I will not send out mass emails very 
often.  I will be talking individually to each of you over the next couple of 
months.  So for any of you that just can't wait for that individual contact, 
please send your recipes in now.  Bill Billinger is sending his this week, I 
think?

This is exciting to me to get this address book out to all of you.  This is 
such an awesome family, and I love the fact that I can stay in touch with all 
of you.  If you need to call me, my phone number is 303-773-6021.

3756,"PSCo files for decrease in the Gas Cost Adjustment (""GCA""):
  

Monday, September 17, PSCo filed an application with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to decrease the Gas Cost Adjustment component of its sales rates, which, if approved are expected to become effective October 1, 2001. This GCA decrease reflects the decrease in market price of natural gas.  In addition to the decrease in the gas sales GCA, a slight increase in the GCA applied to gas transportation service has also been requested, to reflect an increase in the upstream transportation and storage charges applicable to gas transportation customers.

The proposed new GCA's requested by PSCo are:

CG:	GCA = $3.504/Dth, for a new total CG commodity rate of $4.481/Dth.  
IG:	GCA = $3.285/Dth, for a new total IG commodity rate of $3.749/Dth
TF/TI:	GCA = $.055/Dth (current transportation GCA = $.047/Dth)

A Transportation Summary Sheet of the proposed rates is posted on the Web site for informational purposes.

IMPORTANT REMINDER:  Remember that GCA costs noted above and in the Transportation Summary Sheet reflect the proposed rates filed by PSCo, and are subject to revision and/or approval by the PUC before rates become final.  Notice identifying the new GCA rates will be posted on this website upon PUC final approval.

ATTENTION ALL PLANT OPERATORS, SHIPPERS AND NOMINATING AGENTS:

To help avoid the possibility of upcoming weekend OBPs, it is critical that Shippers, Nominating Agents and Plant Operators do not  schedule imbalance payback gas or deliver more gas than what is confirmed into Public Service Company's (PSCo's) system for each weekend, until further notice. 

Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY for gas days September 21 (8AM MT Friday) through September 23 (8 AM MT Monday, September 24). 

Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback gas to PSCo for gas days September 22 - 23.  Any imbalance payback gas remaining on the system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

ATTENTION ALL PLANT OPERATORS, SHIPPERS AND NOMINATING AGENTS:


Weekend imbalance payback restrictions to PSCo will be lifted effective Gas Day November 3rd, until further notice and as system operations allow.  Plant Operators must confirm imbalance payback volumes to  PSCo by no later than 10:30 AM one business day in advance; payback volumes not previously confirmed will be cut and PSCo may activate flow control valves on any plants that are over-delivering into the system without permission to do so.

PSCo's ability to accept imbalance nominations is subject to operational considerations; you will be notified via PSCo's EBB if imbalance payback restrictions are implemented again.

We appreciate your assistance in managing your gas load requirements responsibly.  Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns pertaining to your scheduling needs.

Thanks for the heads up on  9/01.  I'm printing the report right now and I'll get with Amy tomorrow (she's out today).  If you would like to look at August that would be fine - I would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries.  If you could define the differences first then maybe I can lead you to where the issues are.  How does that sound?  

I also think by doing this it will get you familiar with this pipeline and maybe in the future you could take this part over.  It's just very confusing at first.

Let me know ,
Theresa

 "
3768,"I'm sending the invoice/statement via e-mail.  Let me know if you can't open it.  The Crestone OBA Imbalance is the summary we started on showing the discrepancies on the receipt side.

Congratulations on your new job!  I certainly understand you leaving.  I really enjoyed working with you and I'll hate to see you go (At least before the rest of us get let go).

Amy was let go last Friday here along with another guy.  It's only Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci and myself left.

I am working on the November producers today as a matter of fact.  I am hoping to complete them today or tomorrow morning.

I have a walk through on my new house tomorrow afternoon and could possibly be moving on Monday or Tuesday, otherwise it'll be next Thursday.  I wanted to get all of this out of the way before my move.

I'll get busy now and hopefully email you later today.

Thanks,

You know I must say it's been a while since the Packers have had to worry about beating the Bears.  It's kind of fun to see an old rivalry back again.  The Bears are pretty good this year and if the game was in Green Bay I would really bet on the Packers but I'm just gonna hope they can beat them in Chicago.  I hope we'll get the game here in Denver.

See you tomorrow.

Scott Sitter (Crestone) and I have been working on this.  Scott has been trying to reconcile with FUGG on the 12/99 - 10/00 imbalances, then we can take it from there.  

I forwarded this e-mail to Scott to see when we can get together to finalize this.  I will get you a complete summary with all the backup as soon as I can.  (My guess is the last week of November - 1st week of December.  Scott is out most of this week on vacation and I'm out next week.)

I'll talk to you soon.

3786,"I talked to Susan Helton yesterday and she is still trying to track down the rent.  She said she isn't seeing it on a ""paid invoices"" list so she's still trying to get it resolved.  She said it would probably be after Jan. 2nd since so many people are out of the office until then.
 
I haven't seen Todd or Wayne and I didn't see an invoice on my desk from them.

Attached is my resume.  I can probably be reached best on my cell phone (303) 807-6131 or at work (303) 575-6485.

Thanks again for thinking of me.

 "
3789,"Mark,
I'm sure you've already noticed this, but our cell phones have been disconnected.  

I thought maybe we could pay for the bill on a credit card and turn it in on an expense report. Susan Helton is trying to find someone to get guidance from as far as getting this bill paid.  She said in Houston they are no longer paying for parking or cell phones but she wasn't sure about satellite offices.  She would hate to see us not get our expense reports paid.

I'll keep you posted.
"
3790,"Mark,
Susan said to go ahead and expense the cell phones.  I called AT&T and it was 176.92  so I put it on my credit card and I'll turn it in.  The phones should be on now."
3791,"Was our purchase tied to this wire your accounting group received?

"

"
3821,"Three comments (""severe"" concerns?) which I am sorry I was unable to
deliver before the draft order went out to all parties:

1.  I share Robert Fallon's concern.  Although the judge did say at
Monday's prehearing conference that she would accept a party's ""ballpark
estimate"" of its ripple claims, the express inclusion of a procedure for
ripple claim offers of proof could later harm a party that remains silent
on this issue, despite the draft order's statement that offers of proof are
""not required.""

2.  The draft order might benefit from an up-front definition of ripple
claims.  First, though, we need to make sure that we all agree on the
meaning of the terms that we are using.  Depending on how we define ripple
claims, it seems to me that a counterclaim or a cross-claim could indeed be
a ripple claim, and we need to be sure that we are not prejudiced by
failing to assert such claims now.  A counterclaim is my claim against
somebody who has asserted a claim against me.  A cross-claim is my claim
against a third party who has NOT asserted a claim against me.  (As for
""offset,"" I have been under the impression that we have been using that
term to describe a deduction that may validly be made from a refund amount
that I am deemed to owe another party -- particularly, a deduction
occasioned by that other party's unpaid bill from me.)  Presumably, each of
us knows who sold power to us and the prices for those sales.  Therefore,
should I so choose, I already have the ability to assert a refund claim
against any of the entities that sold to me -- whether the seller has made
a claim against me (making my refund claim a counterclaim) or has not made
a claim against me (making my refund claim a cross-claim).  But given my
opposition to ANY refunds in this case, I would prefer to refrain from
asserting my own refund claims (whether counterclaims or cross-claims),
while reserving my right to do so in the future should the need arise.
Perhaps we should define a ripple claim simply as any refund claim that
could potentially be asserted by a party that has expressed an opposition
to refunds in this case.  That way, we could maintain a unified front of
opposition to refunds without being prejudiced in any way from seeking our
own refunds if it should come to that.  In testimony and other filings, we
would make it clear that any refund directive would open the Pandora's box
of wave after wave of ripple claims, but we would not need to quantify them
now.

3.  The draft order, in the title, ""defer[s] ripple claims to a later phase
in this proceeding.""  We want this proceeding to die -- not to live on in
later phases.  Shouldn't the order simply EXCLUDE ripple claims as beyond
the scope of the proceeding?

She finds that spot sales consist of 24x24 and ""within a month and balance of the month"" transactions.  I'll draft a summary and circulate.   "

3824,"Here an updated version

 

 "
3825,"FYI- I will send our comments by Thursday

"
3826,"Couple of additional pieces of information:

In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).  
So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.

Best,
Jeff

The following is more detail on what had occurred below.
In running the metervalidation tool, I noticed on 5/28-a Monday there was a lower than average meter for load zone SDG1 (San Diego).  It was reported at 2,461, when a typical weekday is around 2,750.  I phoned Pat, and we discussed what was occurring and we noticed that Sat. was reported at 2,757 5/26, Sat.  Typically weekends days run at 2450 in SDG1.  

Pat's explanation doesn't fully explain why the weekend would slide one day.  And just in time, we discovered it.

If you need more information, please let me know.  I just re-ran the meter validation and the correct values are placed in 5/26 and 5/28.

3882,"Welcome to the Official PGE PARK NEWSLETTER.  This newsletter has been
created by Portland Family Entertainment (PFE) to give you an insider's
view on PGE PARK, the home of the Triple A Baseball Portland Beavers and
A-League Soccer Portland Timbers.

For more information, please visit our web site at www.pgepark.com, or
call the Ticket Hotline at (503) 553-5555.

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION OVERVIEW
When PGE Park is completed next spring, event patrons may be surprised
to see the magnitude of this exciting renovation.  In partnership with
the City of Portland, PFE will manage a $38.5 million renovation of the
former Civic Stadium to enhance fan enjoyment standards, meet modern
design codes and honor the historic character of this 1926 landmark.

Soon to be the premier outdoor event venue in the region, PGE Park will
feature:

*  New convertible playing surface, adaptable to all events.

*  New baseball dugouts and bullpens.

*  Major League Baseball field dimensions.

*  Vintage style wrought-iron fence along 18th Ave. allowing passerby a
view of all PGE Park events.

*  New seats and wider concourses.

*  New restrooms and baby-changing stations.

*  New concession stands and kiosks with improved menu options.

*  Fred Meyer Family Deck featuring an old-fashioned soda fountain.

*  Yet-to-be-named Widmer field level bar and grill, featuring grills
and full beverage service.

*  Affordable Pavilion Boxes, Field Boxes and Club Seats for
high-quality corporate entertainment.

*  State-of-the-art sound system and new theatre organ.

*  Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Compliance.

*  Current seismic code compliance.

*  ... and much more!

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
Virtually every area of the construction site is currently under
construction.  From elevator pits and structural elements to field boxes
and underground utilities, it's all coming together for our Spring 2001
opening.

The main concourse along 20th Avenue (the first base side), demolished
during the Portland Rockies' season last summer, is re-emerging as a
wider, lowered concourse.  Steel beams and metal decking are being
placed for a major concrete pour in the near future.  This will be the
most visible reconstruction element to date in the project.

Concrete has already been poured at the field level in the area of the
new soon-to-be-named Widmer Bar and Grill.  This field-level area will
have both an open air patio and a space built under the seating bowl for
a true early 1920's bar feel.  Selecting your favorite bar stool for a
view of the game is only a few months away!

We will soon be adding a Construction Update Photo Gallery to
www.pgepark.com.  We will keep you posted on when this exciting feature
is added.  If you would like to receive photos as an attachment, please

3902,"This morning I was notified by Confirms in Houston that one of the deal 
changes I made last night didn't come through on their side. If you refer to 
the Deal Correction Report from yesterday, Mike Swerzbin did a deal with EES 
for Cal'03 that he mistakenly entered twice, once for Cal'03 (571920) and 
once for Cal'02 (571801). He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was 
actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and 
killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your 
calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was 
restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no 
value for either of the deals. 

I've reinstated the volumes in deal 571920 and added the error to today's 
deal correction report. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. Please let 
me know if you have questions.

comments

Without collateral





With collateral
"
3925,"All,

I have looked over the U.S. credit GTC and the long descriptions. I see we 
have decided to go with quarterly billing, rather than monthly. Will the 
payment/collections cycle cause any heartburn for the back office?

I didn't spot any problems with the long descriptions.

A few relatively minor comments on the GTC's - which you may or may not want 
to consider:

- Clause 2.(e) (i) (1) - Does this clause preclude us from doing business 
with banks or other financial institutions? Could we append: ""with regard to 
the Transaction""?

- What happens if a Rep or Warranty is broken? Does that constitute 
sufficient breach to terminate the contract? I'm thinking specifically about 
sleeving, which is perhaps covered by Clause 2(e)(ii)(1)? I still think that 
sleeving is one of the most significant commercial risks faced by online 
trading of derivatives. If I were working for a third party, I'd immediately 
look for ways to set up a sleeving service to sell credit protection to the 
Reference Entities where the Reference Entity or its affiliate views its own 
risk differently from Enron. If I were the Reference Entity in question, I'd 
consider:
 a) Buying a load of protection via sleeving and then declaring bankruptcy - 
then do a Phoenix (in the UK at least)
 b) Buy a load of protection via sleeving, then take the Credit Derivatives 
to another third party financial institution and using the credit derivatives 
as collateral to increase my line of credit - I'm no expert, but I suspect 
there might be an interesting leverage effect here, which might actually 
cause a significant increase in Enron's risk exposure.
 c) Like (b), only the financial institution could buy the credit derivative 
with or without the need for sleeving - we probably need a restriction on 
this? (I know financial institutions are not our preferred counterparts up 
front, but if I were a financial insitution, I'd quickly find a way around 
this limitation - Affiliates or Sleevers.

-  Do you think it would beneficial to strengthen our protection against 
sleeving by adding something to Clause 2, like: ""It is not entering into a 
Transaction for the purpose of concluding a similar transaction with the 
party (or any Affiliate of such party) which is the Reference Entity in the 
Transaction"".

- Should Def'n of ""Contract Currency"" be ""Contractual Currency""? 
(""Contractual"" is also used in the Long Descriptions)

- Def'n of ""Credit Product"" - after ""Entity"", should we insert ""which is""?

- Are we being a bit too nasty by defining the Determination Agent as 
""Enron""? As the reference to Determination Agent in the contract is in a 
context similar to that of an arbitrator, it seems a bit cheeky to then 
define ourselves as the arbitrator - would this be enforceable if we were in 
court?

I'm assuming the other GTC's are very similar to the U.S. one and I have not 
read them.


Dave

3928,"Paul, 

Mark T. asked me to have a look at the GTC's you prepared for Credit 
Derivatives in the USA. I think you did a great job on the GTC's and have 
just a few  suggestions/comments/questions: 

1. Would it not be easier for the Counterparty to understand the document if 
the Definitions were in Section 1? Failing that, it would be helpful to 
indicate upfront that there is a glossary of Defined Terms at the end of the 
document.   

2. I agree with Mark that we would expect for a signed Confirmation to 
control over the GTC's (and/or ETA). Section 1 is inconsistent with this idea.

3. Section 2(d)(iii): I wonder why we are making the Trade Option rep. here. 
I would not have thought that a Credit Option could be considered a 
""commodity derivative"". Put another way - does Sullivan and Cromwell really 
think that the CFTC has jurisdiction over credit products? I would have 
thought credit products are more similar to an OTC equity derivative. I 
wonder if they have considered any potential SEC issues.

4. Section 2 - under the BOLDED WARNINGS, (C) regarding ""... Enron ceasing to 
provide quotations"".  This seems inconsistent with  the opening paragraph 
which says that  this website should not be construed as an offer by Enron to 
buy or sell. If that is the case, why is Enron providing quotations? Seems to 
me that if one is offering a quotation, one is offering the price at which 
one will buy or sell. 

Also, I would recommend to clarify the last sentence in (C)  by adding at the 
end of ""credit products"", both times it appears, the words ""with Enron"". 
There is nothing to stop the Counterparty from entering into new credit 
products with third parties but the current wording could be taken to imply 
this. 

5. Section 4 ""Events of Default"": In the 8th Line, after the word ""Party"", I 
would insert ""to comply with"". 

6. Remedies: Was it a conscious decision to give the Defaulting Party Five 
Business Days to pay the amount it owes but give Non-Defaulting party Ten 
Business Days?   

7. Termination: In clause (c), it should refer to the Scheduled Termination 
Date.

8. Section 11 (C): I would suggest to insert at the end thereof to add 
something along the lines of, ""as soon as such party becomes aware of any 
inaccuracy or misrepresentation.""

9. Section 11 (D): Please check with ENA Tax - I believe we are using new tax 
forms which have replaced the W-8 and 1001. 

10. Section 13  ""General Definitions"": 

""Buyer Payment Date"" I would recommend that the Buyer Payment Dates be 
specified in the actual trade confirmation. This is something I can foresee 
the traders changing for every transaction.

""Effective Date"" : Do you mean 60 Business or Calendar Days? 

""Interest Rate"": In a USD Denominated Agreement where ENA is a CP - I would 
have thought we would use an interest rate quoted by a US bank - rather than 
Barclays.  

Schedule

Governing Law & Jurisdiction: Just to echo what Mark Taylor pointed out - 
normally we are required to use Arbitration rather than Ct. jurisdiction in 
ENA Master Agreements. Haedicke feels very strongly about this. I can send 
the language if you need it.

Exclusion of Third Party Rights: There is a stray quotation mark at the end 
of this paragraph.  

I hope this is helpful - please feel free to call.

3936,"Alan:

Regarding the legal comments below:

My impression was that the Joe had settled the choice of law issue:  i.e. the 
umbrella documents (Password Application and Electronic Trading Agreement) 
will be identical to those used in North America containing a New York choice 
of law provision.  These agreements have been approved by local counsel in 
Japan.  This is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides 
that a document governed by Japanese law is essential.  As is the case for 
all EnronOnline trading, the online GTC's governing various commodities 
contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. English law for 
UK gas, New York law for US derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the 
counterparty is situated.  When a Japanese product is offered, I would assume 
that you will create a GTC governed by Japanese law, but last I heard that 
bridge is still ahead of us.

I don't know what the ""international contracts"" are that Rousseau refers to.  
There is no standard agreement for online trading.  The ETA provides that if 
a counterparty and the relevant Enron entity have a master agreement in place 
(such as an ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives trading [is this what 
Rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions.  
The choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the 
time the master was signed.

In summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, 
the legal side of things is ready to go.

Mark

"
3937,"I have been reviewing procedures that would need to be put in place to cover 
counterparties from other jurisdictions trading Australian power. There is 
one related contractual issue I have not been able resolve. As it is not an 
issue at peculiar to Australia I would appreciate your input. My apologies in 
advance if I am covering well trodden ground. 

It is settled that a counterparty will enter into one Password Agreement and 
one ETA. There will be a principal Enron contracting party for the PA and 
ETA, which I will refer to as the  ""Enron Principal"" . However the definition 
of ""Enron""in both documents also includes other Enron affiliates. In this way 
the Enron Principal enters into the PA and the ETA as an agent for any 
affiliate that may at some stage enter into an EnronOnline Transaction with 
that counterparty. This means the relevant Enron affiliate could enforce the 
terms of the PA and ETA . This is in addition to the rights of the Enron 
Principal to enforce the ETA and PA. But what happens if the Enron affiliate 
is not in existence (i.e. has not been incorporated)  at the time the PA is 
signed and the ETA is  accepted by the counterparty? It is settled law in 
Australia and I believe in England that you cannot be a party to a contract 
if you don't exist.  

What does this mean? Well in most instances not much. If it was a question  
of enforcement of the contractual terms of the ETA or the PA the Enron 
Principal could seek the relevant remedy such as an injunction or specific 
performance. But procedural problems in litigation could arise if a newly 
incorporated Enron company suffered damage through a breach by a counterparty 
of the ETA. For example a breach of the indemnity in clause 4. The Enron 
Principal could not sue for damages as it would have suffered none. 

Whilst not a major issue it may be prudent to ensure EnronOnline procedures 
recognise the particular circumstances that arise when introducing a newly 
incorporated Enron entities as contracting parties through EnronOnline.  "

"
3944,"Mark,

I am wondering if it is necessary to include a few more words in our index 
descriptors.

When we refer to a published index, should we add: ""including published 
corrections"", or is this obvious enough? 

I'm thinking that if there is an error in the index which is acknowledged as 
such in the publication, then the error would be seen as something which 
should be corrected if we ever went to court. I'm also thinking that we would 
not want to apply this kind of language on a go-forward basis, as to have two 
different treatments might prejudice our position (although the UK office 
wishes to add this language on a go-forward)

Thoughts?

Just to clarify a couple of points:

Paul/Denis below have clearly highlighted that london group cannot trade on 
behalf of ENA.  I understand that the First Union trade was done as they had 
an agreement in place with ENA but not .Com.  Bearing in mind, that London 
traders have transacted on behalf of ENA, I expect that we should BTB these 
trades with .Com ?  (Paul/Denis)   

If so, I suggest going forward that where we have to do a trade for ENA we 
get Mozam to do it with Markus' approval as he is based in Houston.  Assuming 
that we get the service agreement in place, we can do the risk mgmt from 
London.  If we do it like this then all other issues go away with the 
exception of service agreements which need to be put in place.

I do not believe that it is correct to say that there is only one book. 
(Paul)  We currently have one business,two books: one in london, one in 
houston.  Each trade is booked against a specific book.  Bryan is quite happy 
to have risk reside in each book assuming legal/tax/regulatory compliance.  
There is NO other reason for BTB that I am aware of.  

 All risk managment takes place here.  However we will not be able to pay out 
of ENA accounts and will have to request them to do so.  

It is quite clear that we have the necessary understanding of the issues to 
resolve so let's get this done ASAP.  Bryan can you ask Mary to arrange a 
meeting for Thurs/Fri.  Paul do you wish to conference in Houston on this ?


Regards

Dave

Bruce: Can you comment on the relative importance of the following countries 
to MG's business? It costs us about GBP 15,000 to add each country (due 
diligence and document preparation costs). I may also be able to add a

 Paul Simon's has advised us that EnronOnline will need to include standard 
SFA language on each Home Page in the garden area where we are promoting the 
services of EnronOnline as we are offering a system which would allow a 
registered user to enter into financial products. This would inculde the 
EnronOnline main Home page in addition to all the new URLs that we are 
setting up for the different markets.
Paul should be able to suppply theh standard disclaimner language required.

the basis of the deal is as follows:

25% brokerage reduction for EnronOnline transactions
EnronOnline transactions may be executed either by clicking or by calling the

 I need your advice and help with this revision to an EnronOnline location

Dick Jenkins is concerned with contractual problems and requests an urgent 
revision to the location description (TETCO M3) that follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3.


He wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include anywhere on the M3.  
Therefore, I have revised the location to the following:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone 
M3, and all downstream delivery on the M3.  

Please advise if this is appropriate as we need to get a ticker item posted

3961,"Today I ordered the wooden floral chest from Learn and Play for Elena.  I
also ordered a child's tool set so she can work along with Tim.  I didn't
include the things I was ordering for the others on the lists I sent you.
 I just couldn't get my act together on Elena and didn't want to wait to
send your e mail until I had made a decision.

I went over to Montgomery Inn last week and looked at their rooms.  They
are nothing to brag about--a huge room that is divided by sliding doors
into smaller rooms.  Even divided it may seem pretty big for 30 people
which is the minimum for which we must pay.  I don't think we should have
any trouble finding that many people to invite.  It is still available
and we have the contract which we will sign and send back by Friday, the
deadline.  It is fairly expensive, but this is a rather important
occasion so we have decided to go ahead with it.

Dad and I finally got our flu shots this morning at our clinic.  It is a
relief to have that accomplished!

3976,"Susan -

Based upon our discussion earlier this morning and the contemplation of CL 
being CP 2 CP type product, I have modified the ESA accordingly.  The 
modification renames the ""Counterparty"" to be a ""User"" and provides that the 
""Other Agreements"" are modified only if both the User and the counterparty to 
those Other Agreements have agreed to use the Website and Modules (e.g., by 
agreeing to the ESA and Annex documents).

I want to do a bit more thinking about the viability of the amendment 
mechanism - an ESA with each counterparty to an Other Agreement - before we 
finalize this and whether or not there is a different and/or better way to 
accomplish this task.
But, in the interest of time and your schedule, I wanted you to see this for 
your review and thoughts.

If you and Tom would be comfortable with the concept of ""User"" vs. 
""Counterparty"", this would require a change to the terminology of the 
Password Application and all Annex documents.

I welcome your thoughts.

Thanks.

3981,"  Monmouth College Trustee Newsletter
  . . . from the President's Office

Issue 4, March 1, 2001

All of us here at Monmouth College send our warmest regards, and I want to
share with you some of the exciting things that are currently happening on
campus.

 * The curriculum review, endorsed by the Board and funded by
the Teagle Foundation of New York City, is gaining impetus.  In April,
George Dehne, a nationally known marketing consultant, will be on campus to
meet with the Curriculum Planning Committee and make a presentation to the
entire faculty.    My hope is that he will sensitize all of us to the market
needs that are out there and focus our curriculum review.  Mr. Dehne will
also meet with the Admissions staff as a follow-up to our discussion at the
Trustee retreat regarding the enhancement of our college marketing efforts.

 * Also, plans are in the works for a two-day faculty planning
retreat following commencement.  We will be using Dr. Ron Purser, the
consultant who worked with us at the Trustee retreat in Indian Wells, to
facilitate our discussions.  We hope to begin to build some consensus for
needed curricular changes based on some of the marketing forces identified
in Dehne's visit.

 * This past weekend, a student written and produced play,
""Lincoln's Lagoon,"" by senior Matt Fotis was performed in Wells Theatre.
Matt's play received excellent reviews in the campus Courier and the local
Monmouth Review Atlas, and many positive comments from the community.

 * The Nominations Committee will be presenting the following
individuals for election to our Board at our spring Trustees' meeting:

   * Mrs. Elizabeth Hiel, a former president of
our Parent's Association and mother of two Monmouth College graduates.  The
Hiels own and operate Hiel Trucking Company, Hiel Enterprises Inc., and
Prairie Equipment Inc. They reside in Prairie City, Illinois.
   * Attorney Mark Taylor, Class of 1978, a
resident of Houston, Texas.  He is Assistant General Counsel for Enron
Capital Trade Resources. Mark has also served MC in the past as a member of
the Alumni Board.
   * The Hon. Daniel S. Weber, Class of 1974, a
felony trial judge in Cook County Circuit Court. Dan will serve as an Alumni
Board representative.  He resides in Westchester, Illinois.

 * The Whiteman Lecture will be held on Thursday, April 19 at
11:00 AM.  This is the day before the spring Board meeting begins, and all
are encouraged to attend what I am sure will be a very interesting address.
The speaker is Walter Huff '56, our Board Vice Chair, and founder of HBO &
Company.  Walter joins a long list of distinguished Whiteman lecturers,
which includes Jim Pate '63, Pennzoil Company; Red Poling '49, Ford Motor
Company; Lee Morgan, Caterpillar Inc.; Leonard Hadley, Maytag Corp.; and
Jerry Porras, Stanford University, among others.

 * We are in the midst of completing a number of faculty
searches.  We already have signed contracts for new faculty in Philosophy
and Religious Studies, Psychology, Sociology, and Plant Biology.  We are
still in the interview phase for hires in Marketing, Molecular Biology, and
Physical Education/Coaching.  We are pleased to have rich pools in these
searches, and we have been able to attract top candidates.

 * Construction/renovation plans for the library, the athletic
and recreation center, the auditorium, and the main dining room in the
Stockdale Center continue.  We want to be able to move quickly as funding
becomes available.  We hope to begin the library renovation this summer, as
well as the remodeling of our food service and the renovation of the locker
rooms and training rooms in Wade Gymnasium in anticipation of the new
construction.

 * The new residence hall construction is progressing nicely,
and plans to open in the fall are on schedule.  I can't wait for you to see
this outstanding facility at the spring meeting.

 * Eleven houses are scheduled to be demolished this spring on
the north and west boundaries of the campus.  Plans are also underway to
construct six competition tennis courts west of the new track facility.

 * The silent phase of the capital campaign is moving forward.
The Trustee Steering Committee has been active and will soon be making
arrangements for solicitation of the Board.  A number of very generous
commitments have already been made, and a progress report will be given at
the April meeting.

 * Admissions is moving along at an encouraging pace. The
following is a comparison of visits, applications, accepteds, and deposits
(as of February 26), for 1999, 2000, and 2001.  If we attain a class of 350,
with our projected retention, we should be nearing 1,100 for opening
enrollment next fall.

 Visits Applications Accepted Deposits Class Size

2001 766 1059 780 150   ?
2000 711 1057 785 136 350
1999 702 1060 748 118 337

 * And, just to keep you up-to-date with a couple of our
distinguished emeritus faculty, Dr. Bernice Fox, Classics Department,
celebrated her 90th Birthday February 19; and Gracie Peterson, Theatre
Department, will celebrate her 99th Birthday on March 2.

3986,"Thanks for your email.   It is important on a going forward basis that if we 
veer from any restriction that Legal has placed on a counterparty (e.g. if 
Credit says it is ok to trade weather under a GTC instead of a master) that 
Legal hear before we trade so we all make sure we are on the same 
understanding as to whether any restriction should be waived.  In response to 
your email I have the following comments:

1.  The New York Times Company:  cannot trade derivatives online at all.  
Their board resolution and master agreement require that two specific 
officers must enter into the trade together on a telephone call.  They cannot 
trade any other way without revising their board resolution and agreement.  
All their  trades must be done by telephone.
2.  San Diego Gas & Electric Company:  the California PUC said that utilities 
such as San Diego cannot enter into derivatives transactions at all!
3.  Aspect Resources:  can enter into derivative transactions.  We want the 
transactions to roll up under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between ECT 
and Aspect.
4.  Brant-Allen Industries:  Is shut down, more or less, for all financial 
trading.  They cannot enter into another derivative transactions with us, 
either on the phone or online, until, prior to entering into the trade, they 
provide us with a board resolution approving the trade or derivative trading 
in general.  The board resolution they provided with the signed master 
agreement only approved the one trade we entered into at that time.
5.  Cox & Perkins:    We had a master with this counterparty and they have 
informed us i writing that they didn't want to trade with us anymore.  In 
reality, if they did another trade, Legal will need to be contacted and we 
probably would try and reactive the master and roll the trade up under the 
master if possible.  Credit, keep us informed if they do trade.
6.  Sonoco Products:  We should not be trading with them at all until we 
resolve this payment dispute.  Sara Shackleton was working on that.  We do 
have a master with them, and if we resolve the payment dispute and begin 
trading with them, the trade should roll up under the existing master."
3987,"Please find attached a slightly revised (by Joe Carrico) draft of the
ISDA/GMRA Insolvency Bridge, which takes the approach, if a Bankruptcy Event
of Default occurs, of deeming relevant repo transactions to be Transactions
under the ISDA Master Agreement.  While we wish to focus our discussion
tomorrow on the draft ""Cross-Agreement Bridge"", we would be happy to hear
some further discussion on this type of approach.

3988,"Mark:  This is a chronic problem which I have addressed with Cheryl on more 
than one occasion (hence the email of this morning).  Her priorities are not 
currently with the swap group.  Also, Carol will not be a reliable backup for 
structured deals since Julia's group will demand more of her time.  I don't 
know what Angela's load will be like as an ongoing substitute.  Last night we 
received notice of Yosemite IV and I'm hoping that Angela can cover.  
Alternatively, we may need to consider Frank, Francisco or Cheryl.

The City Of Riverside has mailed in a password application form to trade on 
EnronOnline (EOL).  This customer is considered a ""muni"" and we need to know 
if there are any legal restrictions (by product type) that would keep them 
from trading on EOL.  We would like to respond back to this customer as soon 
as we receive approval/rejection back from our legal, credit, and tax 
departments.

3998,"Fred, sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but I understand you were in communication with Mark Taylor.  Thanks for the quick turn around and excellent and thorough analysis.  I have both read and understand the analysis.  I am somewhat concerned regarding the final comment regarding ASC's scrutiny of EOL, but other than being careful, I am not sure what we can do.

With respect to transactions with counterparties who are not ""Qualified Parties"", it is almost inconceivable given the breadth of the ""commercial user"" exemption and the representations obtained in our contract that we would ever transact with a counterparty which is not a Qualified Party.

3999,"now that we are officially behind a chinese wall can this process be 
reevaluated?  I think that it will be increasingly difficult to scale at the 
pace we need to over the coming months if we can not design an automated 
process.  Are we trying to avoid actually misusing confidential information 
or the perception of misusing the information?  our intent is to begin to 
scale on a massive level from now until we have reached over a million 
reference credits.

Report # 10 (November 5, 2001)


October was a very busy and productive month for the Curriculum Review Task
Force. We had intensive three-hour meetings on October 3 and 9 which were
followed by routine meetings on October 22 and 29. On the 18th, three CRTF
members (George Arnold, Craig Watson, and Raj Ambrose) participated in a
meeting of the Academic Affairs Committee of the Trustees which was devoted
entirely to the Curriculum Review.

As explained in my last report, the CRTF obtained unanimous agreement on the
five Educational Goals: A. Critical Thinking, B. Communication, C. Values,
Inquiry, and Exploration, D. Variety of Human Experience, and E. Depth of
Knowledge and Integration of Learning with an addendum on Wellness/Health
Co-curriculum. The Task Force then used an intensive work session to brain
storm on the operational ends of these goals. Further discussion and some
pruning led to 4 or 5 operational ends for each goal. Two members of the
Task Force wrote the descriptive statements for each goal and its
operational ends. These were then reviewed by the full Task Force and with
another member contributing the preamble, the draft statement on Educational
Goals (copy attached) was ready for presentation to the faculty. At the
request of the CRTF, the Faculty Senate reviewed these educational goals and

So is the coal group a core group?

As regards job offers, I have not tried as yet. If you recall, I accepted the Enron offer before October 1. And that meant I could not participate in the campus placement process. And the process that started in the first week of October is almost over. My only option it to wait and see and probably take some action in the next semester.

Let's see how things play out!

4024,"Dear Mark and Mark!
I spoke to Jeanette Elbertson last week and she suggested that I send you 
both a brief outline giving some background which I have pleasure in doing.
My Chairman John Wisbey who founded the company in 1989 is next in New York 
in October 11/12/13 but I am unsure as to where we would possibly meet if you 
deemed it worthwhile?
As his Vice Chairman I am working out of our New York office for 6 months 
generally in an effort to raise our group profile and as active associate 
members of ISDA Rick Grove and his team have suggested that I meet as many of 
the Board members as possible during my time.
Since John founded the company we have established a reputation of excellence 
in financial systems,consultancy and training.Today we do business with about 
45 of the world's top 100 banks.We are based in London with offices in New 
York and Hong Kong.
Our 5 businesses could be summarised as follows:

1)Risk Management:
Firmament is an intellectual capital model for the risk process in a 
financial institution.The areas covered comprise credit,market,liquidity and 
operational risk management.
FirmRisk is a suite of risk management component software all web based used 
to evaluate market risk,credit risk and VaR as well as providing 
netting,collateral and P&L analysis.
2) Trading Systems:
Oberon is an integrated multi-currency trading system for the management of 
interest rate and FX portfolios.
3) Document Management:
Image-Gen Planet provides access to data and documents via the Internet and 
was especailly designed for UK local authorities to manage access to planning 
databases.It is believed to be the first UK-built application offering access 
to a Sybase database through the Internet.
4) Valuation Services:
a ) ValuRisk:This is a monthly/daily service providing closing mark-to-market 
prices in the interest rate derivative markets.
b) ValuSpread:This is a confidential price validation service for market 
makers in credit derivative products.
5) Lombard Risk Consultants:
Provides bespoke training to senior level executives in all aspects of risk 
management including Basel.collateral,credit methodologies and policies.Also 
provides courses on all aspects of the derivatives and associated 
markets.Course are also public and web-based.

I will telephone Jeanette next week to see how we might meet in order to take 
matters further.The area we would ideally like to focus on is Risk Management.

Can you please start putting together documentation for the following?

- Pipeline Capacity Trading ETA (to appear on the new capacity trading 
website)
- Pipeline Capacity Trading Service Contract (entered into on paper with 
piplelines wishing to post their capacity on EnronOnline

I imagine the ETA will be modeled pretty closely on the existing ETA.

For the Service Contract, I assume we will be covering things like:

- Nature of the Service (what we will do and what they will do)
 - They will
  -Post products on EnronOnline
  - Take responsibility for their prices
  - Be bound by any transactions which result, subject to their Tariff 
schedules.
  - Pay for any hardware needed at their end and/or any 3rd party connection 
costs (e.g. internet service providers)
 - We will
  - Provide the software
  - Host and maintain the database
  - Facilitate access to the application
  - Administer User ID's
  - Provide support for Product creation
- Representation, warranties and limitations of our liability for the service
- Confidentiality

I assume we may need to sit down and discuss in more detail. I will forward

4030,"Mark,

We were trying to keep the PA to a single page due to concerns about the 
amount of legalise which would need to be read - we didn't want the form to 
be a deterrant. In this case, the addition is just some blank lines to insert 
address for service (plus a few words in the body of the PA) - so I'm not as 
concerned about the impact on length.

If we do not know the company, then a completed Registration Form is required 
- if we do know the company, then the Registration Form is not required. It 
could be argued that if we know the company, then we should already know the 
address for service - but I assume this might lead to errors if the address 
for service desired by the customer for  EnronOnline GTC's is any different 
from what we have on file? - I assume this was the reason David Minns 
forwarded this change.

I'm happy (and perhaps prefer) to have the address for service included only 
on Australian PA's, if neither of you see a need elsewhere - although if you 
don't think its necessary elsewhere, then perhaps it is also not necessary in 
Australia, in which case we could simplify the form?

Please note Australia is already distributing forms with their marketing 
packs, so if we are going to change the form, sooner is better.

Comments appreciated . . .

Rob Walls has referred me to you. I don't believe we have met but I am (for 
my sins) the acting General Counsel at Enron India. We are thinking of 
starting coal trading activities in India and I am trying to get hold of some 
standard form contracts we may have used for our coal trading activities in 
North America. Would it be possible to forward any such forms to me so that I 
can start the exercise of seeing what issues we may have under Indian law. 
Perhaps you could e mail them or alternatively have someone fax them to me on 
(91) 22 288 1793/4.
Many thanks

Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda 
and have the following suggestions:

1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this 
one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.)
2.  German Energy Markets
3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms

There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year 
that might also be appropriate:

Christophe's panel discussion on new markets
E-commerce panel

I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active 
in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions 
for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda."
4039,"There are about 15 - 20 pages you would probably want to see.  If that's not 
too many for you to receive I don't mind faxing it.  You can always call me 
from the office with the fax number when you're ready - I can even leave it 
with my assistant when I'm away from my desk in case you get her instead of 
me.

It's finally winter here, too.  Of course that's nothing compared to you guys 
- it might get down into the 30's at night and 40's in the daytime.  It's 
only really bad when it's that cold and it rains.  Brrrr.  It was probably 
pretty smart of Delta to send those planes to Cincinnati since as a hub they 
could probably get them on connecting flights to wherever they were 
originally headed more easily from there than anywhere else (of course a lot 
were probably headed to NYC and the flights there the next day must have been 
packed!).

Aside from a quick one-day trip to New York I haven't had to do any traveling 
lately - I'll probably be going to Portland in early March and Amsterdam 
mid-March.  I may try and get to South America sometime in February but 
nothing is scheduled yet.

Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just ""under a swap agreement?""

Two quick points:-

1. Have Houston IT yet had the opportunity to review the IP licence 
agreements from a technical standpoint and do they have any questions on the 
wording etc of the documents for discussion with the exchange??  I believe 
that we may be in a position to get signature copies of these documents out 
of the OMLX on Friday of this week, or certainly during the early part of 
next week, and I would  hope that we can avoid having to go back to OMLX with 
IT Dept's queries on the docs after they are issued for signature.

2. Neither I, nor for that matter the OMLX Legal Dept in London, believe that 
Merrills should have a problem under CTFC Part 30 as clearer - in fact these 
Rules probably don't apply at all to them as a clearer (they would if they 
were acting as an execution broker) - and even if the Rules were to bite, 
Merrills should meet the requirements by being FSA regulated in the UK (the 
FSA has an MOU with the CFTC on this issue).  Hence we can't understand what 
Merrills are talking about!!  I wonder if we can short-circuit this issue - 
if Bob still wants to go ahead with Merrills,  may be Bob could put me in 
touch with his contact at Merrills in London and then I can involve their 
Legal Dept (Merrills have a competent Legal crew in London, and should be 
able to deal with this really quickly). 

Kind regards

this afternoon Kris, Sarah, Gloria and I talked with Bob Detonte and Carol Consolver from SoCal.  They will provide Kris with information reconciling imbalance data.  They clarified that imbalance trading will be reflected immediately, thus lessening our exposure.  They agreed to several changes in the contract including procedures for posting of margin.  They agreed to consider our requests to increase imbalance tolerance from $2.5 million to $10 million, and to scale the requirement according to our credit rating.  We expect an answer on these latter issues later today or early tomorrow.  The first reaction was that $10 million may be a ""little too rich"".

Also, where do you think AEC, Talisman and CNRL will be to take permanent assignment of this pipe effective asap... thus changing the deal delivery point around..( an the credit situation).

So:  $6 + $5.1 = $11.10

Question:  What is the credit you will give Pasadena time their capactiy of

Answer:
To figure out what you are paying for the capacity:

Assume SJ Index = 6.00

Then, 
Basin Price/(1 - Fuel %) + Variable Cost + Demand Charge (Kim's # for 
Pasadena) = Border Index

Demand Charge = Border Index - $.026 - (Basin Price/(1- .0388)) 

x = 11.10 - .026 - 6.00/(.9612)

11.10 - .0266 - 6.2422

$4.83 is the implied demand charge 

$4.83 * 3,886 * 29 = Total Credit

4087,"Hi Kim

I'm OK with the March deal. After that, it's a little iffy.

I'm still not comfortable with the April-August El Paso arrangement,
especially since we really don't know how this line will work out after the
split. My preference would be to:
1) buy 1,456/day + loss gas at San Juan Index + 0.05 and flow it to So Cal
Topock(subject to true-up for curtailments); and,
2) sell other El Paso -> PG&E capacity at a future price, tbd.

We tried to get SDG&E to discuss these proposed changes with us, but they 
have not called us back.  Tracy put the credit terms together some time ago 
so please check to see if these need to be revised.  If so, get aSHari to put

best physical bid for your energy as they can keep it in their system and 
avoid transmission.  

I would like to push forward to get ISDA swap contracts in place with BHP.  I 
remember losing a deal with Francis Mcalister a few years ago despite being a 
better offer because contracts were not in place.  Enron North America does 
not have an ISDA with BHP.  We could also push to get a physical electricity 
contract in place.  I think we have a physical gas contract.

Would you like to push ahead to get contracts in place?  Let me know.  It is 
not too early to start the process as it typically takes a month or so to 
make it happen.  What would be the name of the counterparty?  You are the US 
subsidiary of BHP correct?

4101,"Sean:  The attached spreadsheet indicates that for Feb., Citizens has 5 fixed 
price deals, 3 of which you have locked in NYMEX and basis, and 2 of which 
you locked in NYMEX but basis will go to the default which I think is IFGMR - 
NX1.

Kim:  Can you check to see if this matches the way the deals are entered into 
our system and that the prices match the spreadsheet?

4104,"Thanks for the update.  Let's hope Citizens sticks with you guys for the full term.  Jeff Hodge told me yesterday that he has requested some changes in the ENA/EAMR contract from Lou, but that Lou hasn't called back.  I will assume that you will follow up on that contract and make sure it gets done.  With respect to the monthly fee, I am assuming you will be sending ENA an invoice each month.  Kim Ward at 713/853-0685 will be your contact person if the invoice isn't paid and she will coordinate with our settlements group until we get into a monthly routine.

Let me know if there are any other issues.

[IMAGE]	 So, is EVERYTHING suddenly all about Michael? ESPN users are grabbing  Kevin Garnett  as the consensus # 1 pick.  Shaq  simultaneously gives you the best FG% and the worst FT% in the league. And it was Ray Allen  who was the highest rated Fantasy player last year. So we ask you...  Who would you rather have on YOUR team?   And that's the beauty of Fantasy Basketball . Just like the make-or-break dilemmas faced by owners, GMs and head coaches in the NBA, YOU make the tough decisions when building your FBA team.  But like that 40-foot heave with time running out, ESPN answers the call when you need them most -- supplying you with all the team-building tools of the trade for an upstart GM. So suddenly, it's all up to you .  	 [IMAGE]  ? Fantasy Basketball Index  ? 2002 Player Rankings  ? 2001 Final Player Ratings  ? Average Draft Picks  ? Most Added/Dropped  ?

You should probably hold off on the financial trading for now.  Santa Clara is a municipal entity, and until Legal has scrubbed them for authorization to trade financially, we can't do anything with them.  As you know, this is not a quick endeavor.

I can start working on a Master Physical right away, though.  Do you have updated financial info from them?

The cost of your trip insurance was actually 49.00 each. They still refuse
to
refund it and the agent I just spoke with was very nice to see if they could
reaccomodate you in any way on the days you originally requested. She
cannot,
so suggests writing to customer service about the trip insurance refund.
This is who I
spoke with, however. I will get a name, address and phone number of someone
higher

well.  Abri is teething still, molars this time and it is hurting all of us.
I'm sure she is feeling most the pain, so I should stop whining.  I am very
curious about this new beau.  I'm very happy for you.  You better let me
know when you are in town.  Theresa, you and I can have a martinee lunch or
dinner.  It would be great fun.  We will leave Cory at home and I will bring

All are seasoned clinicians.  I've had good reports from persons that have been to see them.  If the arrangment works well for you here, let me know.  In any event the sessions from this point carry a $20 co-pay.  Insurance picks up the rest.  Let me know who you schedule an appointment with and I will get the authorization for the first 6  visits.  Subsequent visits will be authorized by the provider.
