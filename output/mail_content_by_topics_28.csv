Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting:

1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the
Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type.

2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content
for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next
week to gather content and a second meeting for review.

3. We will change ""Gas Daily Risk"" to ""Intra-Month Risk"" throughout the
simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk?

4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems
where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to
hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil
volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

Thank you in advance for your help. Have a great Thanksgiving.

I want to make sure I keep you in the loop on the EBS/BMC/NetWorks/Global 
Strategic Sourcing interactions.

EBS has worked out an additional 25% discount, which brings the total 
discount structure to Enron to a 45%-off pricing level, if EBS and Enron 
aggregate their spend opportunity.  This should come as good news to anyone 
at Net Works who might be about to implement a BMC solution.  

Also, there is additional flexibility in the situation, in that BMC will be 
willing to work with Enron business units with regard to the timing of their 
software purchases as it relates to applicability in EBS' deal.  For example, 
if Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their 
current testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail 
(or other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001 
(the preference would be to get the ""buy"" done by end of 1st Qtr, if 
possible).  This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with 
their purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC.

I'm going to contact your leads (Randy, Bruce, et. al.) to let them know of 
the additional possible discount and the relative ease of securing it...and 
to also help make sure that what BMC is pricing out to all is the correct 
application solution in each instance.

Thank you for your help and cooperation,

Jeff Youngflesh",Bob Randy Matson's Randy Jeff Youngflesh,,EBS Enron BMC

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys.  Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten 
(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the 
contract at this point.  

I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to ""purchase commitment"", etc.  In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.

I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  
Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am 
meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have 
me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call 
me back.

Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  Have I properly conveyed the 
""accepable-to-BMC method"" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?  Your 
note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 
6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?

As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater 
involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on 
the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction 
was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   

In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to 
fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in 
August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and 
identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at 
least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both 
EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq 
Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between 
both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time 
was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq 
(Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 
sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for 
comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  
During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain 
points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed 
to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS 
concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate 
the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the 
development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   

EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with 
our relationship.

33,"Jennifer,

Thanks for hosting the meeting yesterday. Sorry I had to leave but I had to
meet with Beth Pearlman. I believe there was a lot of good information
exchanged and that is why we ran so late. I certainly came away with a
different insight to Enron that I did not have before we met.

Regarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron, I need to make some
things are very clear in our go forward strategy.

At the end of the day, the account team (Dave Spurlin up through Jeff,
myself and Jerry) own the responsibility for the Enron relationship. If
corporate folks are making deals with Enron, we still have to manage the
account. Peter Blackmore is very clear about that. He was always preserved
the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer.
That is why we need to keep Dave focused and knowing what transactions are
taking place within Enron.  He isn't the decision maker on deals like the
EBS one, but as you are well aware of, the EBS contract has impaired other
business opportunities within Enron. Dave's sole responsibility is Enron and
making sure that your needs are being met. He will direct and assist in
making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the
relationship with Enron. I need your help with all Enron organizations to
make sure that they use Dave as the focal point. If folks continue to go
around him, situations like EBS will continue. He has to have the total
picture of business transactions happening at Enron. He will understand how
those situations can impact the business at and for Enron.

Secondly, attached is the information that I received regarding contracts
with Enron. Regarding the Power/Gas contact it is a 5-year deal with the
sixth year being optional. The annual outlay is estimated to be $16.1M per
year. I did make an error in using the $97M divided 5 years versus 6 years.
So at 5 years the value is $80.5M. If you have something different, let's
make sure that we are on the same page. I have attached the emails that I
received this data from.

 <<RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.>>  <<RE: Enron Building
Services Novi MI.>>

Regarding the EBS deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level
set very quickly. Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive
light. Compaq will honor it's commitments but we need to make sure that
Enron does the same. The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of
expectations relative to Compaq's revenue from EBS versus what actually got
booked. Our expectations were $96M a year  based on the forecast provided by
EBS, certainly not $14M (based on what we agreed to yesterday).  I find it
very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held
accountable for our portion of the deal, when we don't have the revenue to
off set it.  Based on what I have heard, both parties had shortcomings based
on expectations that were set. I will speak to Keith and Rob this morning to
see how it was left.   I also need to get your perspective on the
transaction. Jennifer, if there is a business opportunity,  Compaq certainly
wants to continue in pursuing that with Enron. Provided it's equitable for
both sides.   I realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get
through it.


Jennifer, once again I appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and
hosting Compaq. I will contact you later today.

Jennifer Medcalf asked me to forward to you the following brief overview of 
Enron's relationship with Continental.  Please feel free to contact Tracy 
Ramsey directly at #(713)-646-8311 with any further questions regarding 
Enron's buy side relationship  with Continental.   Ramsey is the Global 
Strategic Sourcing, Portfolio Leader, who manages the Continental 
relationship.

Enron Buy Side with Continental:

Current Enron US spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately $40 
million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six months of 2000.  

Enron Sell Side with Continental:

Additionally, Enron has a strong relationship with Continental's Fuel 
Management company.  Specifically, Enron has been hedging Continental's crude 
oil over the past 2+ years.  Value to Enron has been over $9 million; value 
to Continental has been over $45 million since 1999.  Enron Global Markets is 
currently exploring several other business propositions with Continental 
Airlines in the following areas of financial risk management:  weather 
derivatives, plastics hedging, and on-line jet swaps.  Enron Energy Services 
is exploring an energy (electric commodity) deal with Continental as well.

Mr. Dyson, please don't hesitate to call if I can be of further assistance 
regarding these sell side opportunities.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron third-quarter earnings rise.

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday its third-quarter earnings rose as its core wholesale marketing and trading division delivered strong returns. 
The company said earnings rose to $393 million, or 43 cents per share, from $292 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. The company reported a share loss of 84 cents after $1.01 billion of nonrecurring charges.
""After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energybusinesses,"" said Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman and chif executive officer. 
Enron's non-recurring charges included $287 million related to the write-down of its troubled water venture, Azurix, as well as $544 million writedown related to various investments including its retail electricity provider New Power Co. and $180 million related to restructuring of its broadband operations. 
Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected earnings of 42 cents to 45 cents per share, with a mean estimate of 43 cents. 
The results met expectations for a rocky quarter that included the surprise departure of President and Chief Executive Jeff Skilling in August, after just six months at the helm. 
Enron shares closed on Monday at $33.17, down $2.64 or 7.3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year, the stock has fallen some 60 percent, far worse than the 25 percent loss of the Standard & Poor's utilities index .

Enron Has Loss of 84 Cents a Share in Third Quarter (Update2)

     (Adds profit excluding charges in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, said it had a third-quarter loss after taking
$1.01 billion in charges for restructuring, investment losses, and
the planned sale of a water business.

     The loss was $618 million, or 84 cents a share after
preferred-dividend payments, Houston-based Enron said in a
statement. A year earlier, Enron had net income of $292 million,
or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion from
$30 billion.

     The charges totaled $1.11 a share. They included $287 million
for asset impairments by water company Azurix Corp., $180 million
to restructure the company's unit that trades fiber-optic
bandwidth and $544 million for losses on investments including New
Power Co., a retail energy-sales venture.

     Excluding the charges, Enron said it would have earned
$393 million, or 43 cents a share. That matched the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.

     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.

     (Enron will hold a conference call to discuss third-quarter
earnings at 10 a.m. New York time. Log on at http://www.enron.com

OUTLOOK Enron Q3 EPS 43 cents vs 34

10/16/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp is expected to report later today third-quarter earnings per share of 43 cents, compared with 34 cents a year earlier, according to the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of 17 brokers. 
The integrated energy company is expected to meet near-consensus results driven by its wholesale services division, analysts said.
Montgomery Securities analyst Daniel Tulis is calculating third-quarter EPS of 42 cents, 1 cent below consensus. 
Full-year EPS stands at 1.85. 
Enron's third quarter was marked by the unexpected departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling, for personal reasons, with Chairman Ken Lay reassuming the key position. 
Lay is likely to remain in the position until it is filled within 12-18 months, Tulis said. 
The company remains embroiled in arbitration proceedings in India after its 2.9 bln usd Dabhol power plant in India was closed. The plant's sole client, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), failed - and later refused - to pay bills that now total about 45 mln usd.

Reliant Hires Merrill to Find Buyer for Dutch Power Producer
2001-10-16 05:45 (New York)

Reliant Hires Merrill to Find Buyer for Dutch Power Producer

     Amsterdam, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Reliant Energy Inc., the
owner of Houston's utility, said it hired Merrill Lynch & Co. to
find a buyer for its Dutch power-generation business, two years
after acquiring the company from the government for $2.3 billion.

     Reliant has already been approached by possible buyers, said
Clyde Moerlie, a spokesman for Reliant Energy Europe. The unit,
which doesn't have any household customers, earned $9 million in
the second quarter compared with $26 million a year earlier.

     The U.S. company may struggle to get the price it paid for
the Utrecht-based unit, formerly known as UNA, analysts said, on
expectations heightened competition will erode profit further and
as utilities increasingly seek customers as well as power plants.

     In the Dutch generation market, ``there aren't many
opportunities, but prices will fall to much lower levels as
growing competition pushes down tariffs,'' said Steven de Proost,
an analyst at Delta Lloyd Securities in Antwerp.

     Houston-based Reliant paid 2.9 times sales for UNA in 1999,
while Electrabel SA, Belgium's dominant power provider, paid 2.7
times sales for Epon, the biggest utility in the Netherlands. E.ON
AG of Germany paid 1.6 times sales the same year for the generator
NV Electriciteitsbedrijf Zuid-Holland, or EZH.

     Reliant joins rivals TXU Corp. and Edison International in
reassessing its European business amid disappointing earnings.
Reliant in July tied the second-quarter profit drop in Europe to
increased competition and falling margins in the Dutch market.

                            Enron Cuts

     Enron Corp. said last week it will cut 10 percent of its
European workforce, while Edison Mission Energy agreed to sell two
U.K. power plants to American Electric Power Co. on Monday.

     The U.S. utility said last month it was considering a sale of
the Dutch business after it was contacted ``by a number of parties
who have expressed an interest'' in its European assets, and as it
reallocates capital to fulfill ``growth objectives.''

     Merrill already advised the Dutch state on the original sale
of UNA to Reliant, the only time a U.S. company has taken control
of a continental European utility. This year, Merrill ranks sixth
in advising on transactions involving a European utilities target,
with $6.9 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions.

     Potential buyers for UNA, which provides about 20 percent of
the Netherlands' electricity, are likely to be companies already
present in the Dutch market, such as Nuon NV, Eneco, or Spain's
Endesa SA, analysts said. UNA may also attract generation
companies including Mirant Corp. and International Power Plc.

     Atlanta-based Mirant and International Power predecessor
National Power Plc both bid for UNA when it was first put up for
sale. Central and Northern Europe are ``areas we're interested
in,'' said Aarti Singhal, an International Power spokeswoman.

     ``We're looking at all options,'' said Fransce Verdeuzeldonk,
a spokeswoman for Nuon, in an interview.

                         Spanish Interest

     Endesa, Spain's largest power producer, agreed to buy Remu
NV, the No. 4 electric utility in the Netherlands, for 1.5 billion
euros last December. The completion of the transaction has been
held up by the Dutch government, which wants at least 51 percent
of utility company shares to remain in the hands of public
authorities until at least 2004.

     An Endesa spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the
company would be interested in UNA. Endesa said in July its
purchase of an Italian generator was enough to meet its goal of
having 8,000 megawatts of capacity in Europe outside Spain.

     Based in Utrecht in central Netherlands, UNA is one of the
four main power generation companies in Holland, operating six
power plants. It had 1998 sales of about $800 million and is one
of the only generation companies in the market up for grabs.

     Germany's E.ON owns EZH, Belgium's Electrabel controls Epon,
while EPZ, another big power producer, is owned by Essent NV.




India: IDBI signals SOS for Rs 3,000-cr equity

10/16/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd

NEW DELHI, Oct. 15. INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India (IDBI), the country's largest development financial institution, appears to be heading for some serious trouble. 
A revised set of figures placed by the institution to the Ministry of Finance has indicated a cash requirement of Rs 7,000 crore over the next three years, much of which it is finding difficult to tie up. Besides, it has also placed a request for a Rs 3,000-crore equity infusion from the Government.
The revised financial projections were placed before the Finance Ministry last week by an IDBI team headed by the Chairman, Mr P.P. Vora. The meeting was attended by the Advisor, Ministry of Finance, Dr Rakesh Mohan, the Additional Secretary, Capital Markets Division, Mr S.K. 
Purakayastha, and the Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Mr G.P. Muniappan. 
At a meeting on October 5, IDBI had placed its capital infusion requirement at Rs 2,500 crore and immediate fund requirement at about Rs 5,500 crore. 
Officials have been particularly concerned over IDBI's admission that it has been struggling to raise resources from the market due to the rating downgrade in August despite its massive requirements. It has also admitted to the Ministry that it may be heading for losses during the current fiscal. According to sources, the institution has admitted that the losses could spill over to the subsequent year unless assistance comes at an appropriate time. 
IDBI has said the capital infusion of Rs 3,000 crore is being sought to write off a portion of the institution's huge portfolio of non-performing assets (NPAs), which at the end of fiscal 2000-01 stood at over Rs 9,000 crore in gross terms. 
The institution has argued that only a massive NPA write-off would enable it to get back its rating, thereby allowing it to tie up the funds requirement from the market. IDBI's rating was downgraded by Crisil from AAA to AA+ recently. 
IDBI, which was directed by the Government to submit a three-year cash flow statement during the October 5 meeting, has said the additional cash requirement for the three years alone stands at Rs 7,000 crore. 
Of the cash requirement, the immediate need includes a Rs 2,200-crore repayment arising out of the institution's decision to exercise the call option on its earlier bonds series. The repayment would be due in March 2002. 
Moreover, the institution also wants to keep itself ready in the event that Enron, the promoters of Dabhol Power Company, invokes its guarantee of about Rs 1,800 crore.

BOMBAY, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Tata Power Company, India's largest private utility, on Tuesday reported net profit for the July-September quarter rose 74 percent over a year earlier, far above analysts' expectations. 
The company, which is negotiating to buy Enron Corp's stake in a troubled Indian unit, said net profit rose to 2.42 billion rupees ($50.42 million) from 1.39 billion a year earlier on sales that rose 17.54 percent to 10.99 billion rupees.
The performance was boosted by a profit of 660 million rupees from sale of long term investments in the quarter, against 210 million a year earlier. 
A Reuters poll of 14 brokerages released last week forecast net profit for the quarter would drop to a median 1.27 billion rupees from a year earlier, on an 8.45 percent rise in sales to 10.11 billion rupees. 
Tata Power generates thermal and hydro-electric power, and distributes electricity across the western state of Maharashtra, including its capital Bombay. 
Ahead of the results, its shares closed down 0.62 percent at 96.65 rupees while the Bombay benchmark index ended 0.54 percent higher. (US$1=47.99 Indian rupees).

          NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:     J. ROBERT COLLINS, JR., PRESIDENT

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will extend trading in its natural
gas futures and options contracts to 2:45 PM from their regular closing time

that trading in natural gas futures and options will be extended until 2:45

regular release date of the AGA report.

+ looking into all this because we can take some money.. also good to just clear up lines as this has been a major impediment to bigger deals this year.
 
+ campbell- can you give me 5 minutes to give them comfort we can clear ANYTHING they want.. 
 
market comment.. talking to pulaski today..put on the following through the floor today- strikes could be slightly different..
jan02- short 5 calls, long 3.75 calls, short 2.75 puts- 1200 lots
jun02- long 2.75 puts, short 3.75 calls- 1500 lots
 
basically playing small withdrawal scenerio in nov and dec and high end march storage.. wants to be max short summer but does not see big move till mid jan- willing to risk the 2.75 line on the jan options..
 
seems contrary to what you've been talking about.. weak front, supported back...unless you do not see weakness till jan/feb.... ",csfb,,CSFB catequil Libor

73,"The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate 
unique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 
8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and 
Q86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore 
count as a total of four deals.     

We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as 
just one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL 
Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals 
are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this 
currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most 
conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results 
in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.

If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

proposal to conduct a competitive solicitation to procure guaranteed
generation service during natural gas curtailments in the Los Angeles Basin.
Since the service must in place by December 1, 2000, and the ISO expects
this service to be provided by existing generation, the ISO needs to have
responses by October 6, 2000.  ISO staff is preparing the materials for the
solicitation and expects to release those materials in the next few weeks.
We expect final approval of a response by the Board of Governors during the
week of October 23, 2000.

110,"Subject: FW: Aggies Demand a Recount

College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&M Aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma won 35 to 31. ""The end
zones were confusing,"" says Slocum. ""I'm sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go into ours.

We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never have scored
thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&M demands a recount.""

Oklahoma officials are calling this ""outrageous"". ""They agreed to the size,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,"" replies OU coach
Bob Stoops.  ""If they had a problem with them, they should have said so
before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with the
outcome.  Someone had to lose.  We've scored over thirty-five points many
times.""

A&M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.  ""We
are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner of
the game,"" says Slocum.

OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end zones
were used. ""They didn't have a problem with the end zones until they lost,""
says Stoops.

Outside of Kyle Field, A&M student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as, ""A&M wants a fair game! WHOOOOOOP!"" Students' thoughts echoed
their signs. ""All we want is a fair total of the points before we declare a
winner,"" says student Karen Hays, an aggie from Marfa.

""We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a
winner.""

ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&M the winner,
despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at that point. At about 2:30
pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC had to back off its
prediction.

College football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. ""We felt that with a
number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs and the Aggies, we were
certain A&M would carry this game. We may have been premature in our
prediction.""",R.C. Slocum Slocum Bob Karen Hays Brent Musburger,,AP the Texas A&M Aggies A&M OU WHOOOOOOP aggie ABC Aggies

Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback 
 Sept. 19, 2000
By Len Pasquarelli
SportsLine.com Senior Writer
 



Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter 
interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their 
starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, 
SportsLine.com has confirmed. 

""If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not 
the case,"" coach Norv Turner said. ""But it goes beyond just the quarterback 
position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general."" 

   
Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the 
unbeaten Giants.(AP)   

In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday 
night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for 
the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of 
the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in 
scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games. 

A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson 
has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth 
quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or 
his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that 
it might be time for a change. 

One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to 
throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have 
only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 
yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to 
tailback Stephen Davis. 

The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both 
starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 
yards per catch this season. 

But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at 
this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new 
focus more than a new starter. 

""There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks),"" he said. ""Right 
now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere 
else.""

   1. Introduction

   So, who the heck is LoneStarMusic.com? Well, as it says
   on our home page, we're the ""True Sound of Texas."" Of
   course, one man's true might be another man's trouble.

   So, what do we think true some Texan sounds are? Hmmm . . .
   acoustic guitars. Steel guitars. Townes Van Zandt's blues.
   Kelly Willis' voice. The Brothers Robison and the Sisters
   Damnation. Electric lounges, armadillos, and Do-Wacka-Do.
   Texas tornados. Broken spokes. Pat Green, Gruene Hall,
   and Lubbock (on everything). Lucky Dogs, Lost Gonzos,
   and lots and lots of Gourds.

   Whatever Willie Nelson says it is.

<*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*><*>

   2. Mission Statement

   LoneStarMusic.com wants to provide an outlet for independent,
   roots-aware Texas musicians. (As for what those roots are,
   please reference previous section). Texas has produced a
   striking amount of great, original music, and only a corporate
   behemoth can cover all of that real estate. I think we're doing
   our part, though, attempting to represent smaller artists - like
   ourselves - who are trying to get a handle on the many
   elemental influences that tug on you when you live in Texas.
   That's why we're not standing still. LoneStarMusic.com wants
   to become a full resource for Texas music. We want to provide
   information, sounds, graphics, books, and anything else that
   might help us musically navigate the ought-oughts. The future
   will include an expanded version of what Texas music is and

155,"California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Fellas:
 
Enjoyed the weekend with you all immensely.  I  think Travis and Don Jr. are my new benchmarks for late night longevity, and  Don. Sr. is my new benchmark for marksmanship from a seated position.   
 
I want to make you all aware of a new organization  that I have helped start up.  The Saltwater Conservation Association of  Texas was founded to give Texans a new conservation resource that is dedicated  solely to the coast of Texas.
 
We are a 501 (c) 3, non-profit, and we have no paid  staff.  Our goal for the next 3-5 years is to assist TPWD in their effort  to retire as many commercial shrimping licenses as possible, as Texas shrimpers  now accumulate around 80 million pounds of bycatch annually.  This bycatch  includes an incredible amount of flounder and croaker, not to mention numerous  forage fish for trout and reds.
 
We are an authorized agent of TPWD, whereby we can  solicit bids from shrimpers, purchase their license, and then hand it over to  TPWD.  The program is intended to target bay shrimping (not bait shrimping)  as the bay shrimpers drag their nets for hours on end, whereas the bait  shrimpers usually only drag for around 20 minutes or so.  To make a long  story short, the effect of thousands of chains dragging across the bays on a  daily basis is not good for the ecosystem.
 
I hope you will all consider becoming a Founding  Father.  If not, then any level of sponsorship is certainly  appreciated.  Details of our organization and sponsorship levels can be  found at our website - www.scatexas.org  -  or you can call direct at 512-392-1256.  You can join online or print an  application and mail it in.
 
Thanks for your consideration, and once again I  really enjoyed the weekend with you all.  Take care.

188,"I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we 
discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we 
had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta 
Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle 
Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for 
Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today 
during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems 
with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I 
talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said 
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We 
plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to 
introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos 
for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to 
postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were 
comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need 
consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the ""new"" streamlined version of the screens and feel that 
it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

192,"I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues

200,"In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how 
it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at 
X35856. ",A.   Debbie Brackett,,"VAR the

As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on 
Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged 
for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads 
up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last 
minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we 
can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so 
there is going to be no further progress on this front.

In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put 
together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this 
stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC 
perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I 
am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at 
least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will 
also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people 
with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?

I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston 
(and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding 
list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be 
completed as part of the curve validation

As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I 
think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I 
will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER 
""prosecutable"" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more 
communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his 
transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in 
charge of the office.  Probably more to the point,
it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team 
that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that 
he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from 
Houston has to be part of the ""World Tour""  in Europe (Brent Price), that 
your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David 
Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve 
Young.

Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry 
has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell, 
and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I 
just happen to be the most vocal.

and somehow I thought that the time passed more quickly if I was in the 
office in my normal routine.  Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.  I set my 
last date of work for Friday, May 11.  Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' 
Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of 
days until Meagan was born.  With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I 
was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.  She was a week 
late, so we just didn't know what to expect.  Tyler's due date was December 
18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.  Of 
course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was 
out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.  A lot of this probably 
depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have

permits that restrict them to running for self-supply backup generation 
only.  In such case, the air permit may have to be amended by the industrial 
before it can sell to the grid.  Feel free to call upon Gov't Affairs if you 
have a question about this.

Subject: Interconnection: Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials  

*****Please note that with the authorization below, interconnection issues 
with the attached utility still need to be addressed.  (This includes 
agreement, queue, facilities if needed, etc.)  Call us if you need 
assistance.  Thanks.


   



Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be ""public utilities"" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

246,"Hello Everyone,

	We had a few upsets this week, with some games missed by quite a few people. No one correctly picked Georgia
defeating #7 Tennessee. Oklahoma/TX game was mixed, many people missed Ohio St. beating Northwestern and the only non-top 25 game was mixed, with many people taking Southern Miss, as Memphis won 22-17. In the pros, many people picked Atlanta over the Bears incorrectly, San Diego over Cleveland was missed by most people, Arizona upsetting the Eagles was not good for just about everyone, Seattle beating Jacksonville was not picked by most people and Tampa Bay defeating Green Bay was also missed by most. Through all that, Joe Step did only get 5 incorrect picks and has won this weeks pool already. I came close with 6 wrong, but we both have St. Louis tonight. We had 33 entries this week, the most we've ever had, even back to last season, good job!! Therefore Joe won $66. Below is each person with the number of games they missed this week.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001

297,"Dear Sandra,

I sincerely apologize if I offended you in any way Wednesday evening.  That
was certainly never my intention. I let my competitive emotions take over. I
was attempting to compare myself with other brokers not any specific shop.
If I singled certain brokers out that was not my intention.  I was honestly
trying to stress that I really work hard to earn the business.

I can truly say that I slept very little that night reflecting on things
that were discussed in our dinner.  After pondering the discussion about the
firmness of physical gas, I was afraid that I did not communicate my point
well and insulted your intelligence and your ability to judge the
intelligence of your brokers.  I certainly would never purposely do that. I
respect your reputation in the market and your knowledge of the market. Upon
reflection of the conversation, I did not communicate my points concerning
physical, and I cannot say enough that it was not my intention to insult you
(whether you work at Enron or not).

I have reviewed the conversation with Steve and Jon (Ray is at lunch), and I
can honestly say I was trying to point out Enron's strength in the
marketplace.  I chose the West as the example because of the volatility.  I
certainly meant it on how the market has changed; NOT how Enron manipulates
the market or is putting traders out of jobs.

I am embarrassed that I lost my composure.  I felt you were trying to
challenge our group to raise our level of game (which you did).  I did not
mean to dominate the conversation from Natsource's point of view.  Steve and
I agreed that we both could have handled the discussions much better.  I do
not blame Steve as my boss or Jon as the desk head for not stopping the
conversation.  I am an adult and a professional so I take full
responsibility. As brokers, our job is to communicate.  Clearly, we failed
in this regard.

I obviously would like to make it up to you and your firm.  I hope my lack
of composure does not cost my entire firm any of Enron's business.  I hope I
can work through the issues I created for the Gulf desk.  I will take it
personally to take your points about our desk and make them happen.  I do
not want you uncomfortable with anyone who speaks with you.  Your respect
for Ray is obvious, and I will try to support whatever you decide to the
fullest.


Sincerely,

Aaron

***************************************************

Can a non-web enabled application be launched/accessed from a portal? 

Answer:  Upon further verification, we have confirmed that a non-web enabled 
application can be launched/accessed from a portal to look as if it is web 
enabled; however, this is not an IT recommended practice.  Why?  If the user 
does not have appropriate software loaded on the PC, an error message will 
occur.  Per Philippe's group, this practice has been proven to be more of a 
challenge than a convenience.  

The portal page is just  HTML text and links. For non-web enabled 
applications, you won't be able to pull any of the application content into 
the portal.  The portal page can however, contain a link to the application, 
but any setup that is required on the user machine must exist in order to run 
the application. In other words, for something like a MS Word document, you 
won't be able to extract text from that document and display it on the portal 
page, but you could have a link to the Word document on the portal page and 
as long as the user had Word loaded on their machine, then it would start up 
MS Word and display the document. So, for MS Office applications it's not a 
problem because we know that Office is installed on all desktops. If  you're 
talking about proprietary in-house applications, then every desktop might not 
be configured for those applications.  This is where the problem starts.  

Implication:  It is critical for Enron to undertake an effort to ensure, 
ultimately, the most important, driving, in-house applications become web 
enabled and are available via the portal.  This will require development work 
which means it will take time and money for this to happen.  In some cases, 
significant costs may be required to make this happen.  For example, 
web-enabling SAP alone is in the $3 million plus range.  The Task Force plans 
to release a proposal defining a strategy to address how to make this happen 
and how much time and money will be required to make it happen.  

Can non-web-enabled information be accessed via a portal?

Answer: Yes, if the information is in a database and the IT organization is 
given access (given a password and ID), then the information can be accessed 
via a link from the portal.  If the information is not part of the database 
then it must be web enabled to be pulled from a portal.  Some information 
(such as an excel spreadsheets, a word doc., a .pdf file, etc.) not web 
enabled may be linked from a portal.  This access, however, would enable the 
viewer to manipulate the document and, in the case of excel, view the 
formulas behind the spreadsheet.  Some groups do not want this sensitive 
information available to users.  Users would not be able to save the changes 
back to the server, but would be able to print manipulated information.",Marie Hejka Per Philippe's,$3 million,MS Office Office Enron SAP The Task Force
341,"The purpose of this e.mail is just to advise you that we will start the 
process of completing two DASH's for two large projects totaling about $1.6 
billion.  The customer is Panda Energy/TECO.  

Subject to Board approval, we would like to sign a contract sometime between 
15 - 20 December.

We have just recently agreed to a price and are now entering into contract 
negotiations.  

We will immediately apply the ""Risk Book Model"" to these two projects; and we 
will begin working a DASH with the RAC group.  Because each of these 
contracts will total about $800MM, I wanted to give you a heads-up.  If we 
can achieve a contractual agreement with TECO and receive Enron Corporate 
approval, these could prove to be outstanding projects for NEPCO, because the 
two contracts are really the duplication of eight similar projects and doing 
them repetitively, should prove very profitable for NEPCO.

344,"Mark- here is my response to your request. Call with questions.

Goal:
Total Foreign Exchange Exposure quantified and communicated to BOD.

Performance:
Project completed with final tranche of results reported to Finance Committee 
Dec 11. The notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on 
earnings and CTA accounts have been quantified and reported to the BOD over 
the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to. Also, a 
template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes 
in the future. Enron has never had a comprehensive review of FX exposure 
prior to this activity. As an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging 
activity resulting from this effort.

Goal:
Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES.

Performance:
Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across 
EES. A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results 
presented to the Finance Committee. A RAC task force has been put in place 
which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has 
agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit 
control systems where they need to be. Significant progress has been made 
against these recommendations. DSM projects have been spot tested with 
outside measurement firm and the results reported to EES. These tests have 
highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best 
employed.

Goal:
Solidify the global risk management policy beyond Houston and London.

Performance:
Complete and Ongoing. During 2000, Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC 
which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking 
place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to. A data base 
system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these 
offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to. 
Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC, AA, and operations to really 
understand where we have risks. It also helps in defining where we don't have 
responsibility such as EOTT,  Azurix  and The New Power Company.",Azurix  ,,BOD Finance Committee CTA Enron FX EES DSM the Finance Committee RAC Project Doorstep AA EOTT The New Power Company

 This will just be
a quick update on the status of everything, as I see it, based on the
information provided.

1.  A priority package was sent to you and should arrive by 8/30/01 which
includes an

-updated diskette for the EOTT PL TANKS Excel workbook, which now includes:
--a station summary (worksheet) of TNRCC emission fees for the 13 stations
which owe them, plus Crane and McElroy, which don't.  Fees are due to
TNRCC by 11/1.  Necessary account numbers have been obtained.

--a detailed tank emissions worksheet, with emissions by tank based on
throughput, and the total emissions for the station. More importantly, the
9 conditions which trigger the TNRCC emissions fee are listed for your
reference.

2.  Hard copies of the station summary,  the more detailed tank summary,
and the TANKS 4.09 tank
emission computer printouts for the 15 sites are provided.  For your info
only, I also ""marked-up"" a tank listing and tank inspection schedule which
indicate updates I made since last month.

3.  Regulatory Compliance:
Texas: No inspection fees for SIC 4612.  Emissions fees due by 11/01. See
#1 above.

NMex:  No fees.  Tank regulations in development.  No problem.

Federal, NSPS:  5 New Mexico tanks (1-LocoHills West, 4-Maljamar) are Kb
subject and require control, unless they meet exemption.  Further
investigation and documentation required.

Dear  Michelle:
 
     On Tuesday, October 23, I met with Christina Solomon, counsel for Doug  Miller.  The elusive Liz Miller failed to attend, having been called at the  last minute into an all-day meeting.  We have tentatively agreed that we  will meet next week.
 
     Despite Liz Miller's absence, I believe that the meeting was productive.  I  learned the following information:
 
     1.    Doug Miller claims that there are three power grids that  are unrelated, that he worked only in the East for ENA and works only in Texas  for Calpine.  Thus, he claims that his duties and activities do not overlap  in any way with those he performed for ENA.
 
     2.    Calpine did not know of Miller's non-compete at the time  Miller was hired because he believed it had expired.  He brought it to  Calpine's attention immediately upon being contacted by ENA.
 
     3.    Christina argued, as she did in the answer and  counterclaim, that the non-compete agreement was fatally overbroad, as Miller  never had any duties involving the majority of the activities from which the  non-compete purports to bar him. 
 
     In response, I told her the following:
     
     1.    We do not accept Miller's assertion that simply working in  another region will sufficiently insulate our trade secrets, since strategies  may not be confined to a single region.
 
     2.    I pointed out to her that Miller's contract very clearly  states that the non-compete extends three months after employment even if the  contract term has expired.  I also pointed out that he was reminded of his  non-compete orally several times by ENA personnel upon his  resignation.
 
     3.    I explained that the non-compete had been enforced on many  occasions and that it was carefully crafted with an eye to protecting the many  trade secrets to which Miller may have had access.  I argued that  strategies concerning one aspect of ENA's business might impact many other areas  and that, as such, the non-compete was not overly broad.  [She asked what  trade secrets we were trying to protect!!  I, of course, declined to  answer.]  Despite the fact that I believe that these facts are clearly  stated in our petition, she confessed to not having viewed the situation from  the ""trade secret perspective.""    
 
     We ended the meeting with her stating that Calpine and Miller were both  interested in trying to resolve the matter and that she welcomes a proposal from  us.  While she did not elaborate, I believe that they would entertain a  suggestion of some sort of limitation on his activities for some short  period of time.
 
     Please let me have your thoughts about this matter.   Thanks.
 
Best  regards,

Your plan sounds good to me.  You all have done a good job of researching 
this data, and I believe we are in a strong position.

My one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting 
resumes from them.  What is the harm in accepting them?  Are we obligated to 
interview the candidate?  Given this situation, it is possible that telling 
them not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially 
since their ""proven track record"" is only for one placement.  It does not 
appear as if they are flooding us with resumes.  Let me know if my assumption 
is not correct.

Also, I am not sure your apology is necessary.  It certainly is 
well-intentioned, but I wouldn't want it to be construed as some sort of 
admission of wrongdoing.  So, unless you feel compelled, . . . .

Thanks.

Thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume.  He certainly has a strong academic and work history.

Unfortunately, it is not Enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law school.  We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here.  The rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.

So, please thank your friend for his interest.  If you would like, I would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school.  Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.

Call me with any questions.

I guess I think that it is not worth the fight these days.  I suppose would approve this training, but I think we need to have an understanding w/ Ogletree about travel time, travel expenses, billing rates, etc.  They need to understand who holds the purse strings, and I do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training -- or could send me or Lizzette to do it for the cost of travel only.    For your information, David, there is nothing magic about the training they are doing.  It is standard training that I used to deliver frequently when I was in private practice.  Ogletree does not have a monopoly on it.

I'll try to call you early this week, now that the other work I have been focusing on may slow down a bit.

Our practice and intent has been to pay after they start, and I believe that the letter refers to payment after they start, so there is some wiggle room on the other side.

I agree that it is not a ""slam dunk"" on our part, but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim.  We then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed.  In the meantime, I am comfortable with this level of risk.

Many US papers are planning ad rate increases in an effort to make up for lost ad dollars -- The Hartford Courant  plans a 3% to 4% boost in 2002, The New York Times' overall rates will likely increase 5% or so next year, while The Wall Street Journal's net effective general ad rate will be up 3.3%.  USA Today's general rate will go up 4%, as it has in recent years.  The Houston Chronicle plans to raise daily ad rates about 5%, only slightly below last year's hike, said Gary Randazzo, senior vice president of sales and marketing. ""While the downturn is significant now, ... we think that, because of the [federal] stimulus package, ... next year may begin getting back to some normalcy,"" he said, adding that advertisers may benefit from wider use of volume discounts.

Unsolicited spot offers are a reducing feature of European pulp buyers' lives.
Pulpex futures prices have crept up in the past two weeks. When Pulpex prices move away from spot prices, this tends to indicate the direction to be expected for spot price movement.

.!=20

Elaborate planning is one of the ingredients that make parties and entertai=
ning exciting, but the most casual and impromptu events have remained neare=
st to my heart.

I was about eight years old and lived in a white clapboard house with a pre=
tty green lawn at 1030 Douglas Avenue. One spring day, my best friends and =
I were sitting on the lawn with some cookies when we spotted Buzzy Gerard, =
who lived catty-corner to me.

Buzzy was setting up his lemonade <http://www.domestications.com/product.as=
p?product=3DD370224zz&dept%5Fid=3D16200&parentname=3DTabletop&featurename=
=3Dcode=3DDOM-EMAIL-030602-AHTML03-macs=3DD2BNEWSA> stand. It was his sprin=
gtime thing. It wouldn't matter much, and I certainly wouldn't be rememberi=
ng this now, except for the fact that Buzzy and I were great competitors. W=
hat began with entertaining my friends that afternoon turned into enterpris=
e.

Now, as we all know, summer is the traditional season for a lemonade stand,=
 and of course it did begin as a summer idea until Buzzy moved his set-up d=
ate from June to May, forcing me in turn to put my little red wagon out in =
April!

Buzzy was quite polished, organized, and more than a little vocal when he s=
aw someone coming. Frankly, the only thing that extended the life of my bus=
iness was my mother's idea to include oatmeal cookies with my watered-down =
lemonade as Buzzy adamantly stuck to his ""lemonade-only"" policy.

However, this vicious competitor's established reputation and aggressive ap=
proach eventually led to me caving in. I didn't mind that he proved victori=
ous. I decided it was much more fun sitting on the front lawn with the girl=
s, giggling, entertaining ourselves with cookies, lemonade and a front-row =
seat as Buzzy trapped every car, bicycle and occasional pedestrian who ente=
red his ""victim zone.""

Whether your entertaining is formal with kings, or relaxed with the kids on=
 your street (I imagine it's really somewhere in between), the first step i=
s to send out the invitations. Sending the invitations first will make you =
realize the show must go on!

Keeping your entertaining simple, light and casual is a great way to start.=
 People will be more inclined to return the invitation when they're not so =
intimidated.

Here are a few easy-to-implement party ideas to get you started:

Pick a theme - This will make your selection of invitations, d?cor, and men=
u much easier.
Engage your guests - Specify a dress code that complements your theme (like=
 Chinese New Year!). This will energize your guests before they even arrive=
.
Keep it simple - Select food that you can make ahead so you won't be spendi=
ng the whole party in the kitchen.
Go for ambiance - Candles <http://www.domestications.com/product.asp?produc=

455,"The February EC meeting (wholesale gas quadrant) will be held Thursday, Feb 21.  The agenda is light; I'll attend via conference call.  I want to mention a couple of items.

A vote will be taken to change the version 1.5 'GISB' standards to 'NAESB' standards.  There's been some discussion on the proper way to vote (e.g., 17/2, procedural).  It will probably be a 17/2 vote.  I don't think it matters.  The only issue I see is that people will want to make it clear that this 17/2 vote should not be interpreted as a vote in favor of each and every standard.  It is only a vote in favor of changing the standards to NAESB.  A comment can be made on the record.

The 'Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas' will be voted.  We have not been involved with or concerned about this document since we will not use it.  If a motion is made to accept it, I plan to vote in favor.  Comments have been submitted and it appears that this recommendation may be sent back to subcommittee for further work.  I'll go along with this if motioned.

Last December the EC adopted revisions to standards based on the recommendations in the Sandia Labs Report.  These revisions have been incorporated into GISB's response document, which has been distributed to the EC.  This response document was received earlier this week; I have not verified GISB's work.  This item is not on the EC agenda, so I don't know the specific intent.  They may want the EC to approve the final version -- which means approving GISB's work.  I have a concern with that type of vote.  They may want the EC to approve the 'Executive Summary' and 'Conclusion' (total 3 pages).  I have no problem with that vote except that these documents have not been updated since the December revisions were made and are no longer correct.  I'll take care of during the EC meeting.  (NOTE: The revisions to standards have not been distributed for ratification.)

The plan is to bring the response document before the Board at their March meeting for ""approval"".  The response should also be reviewed by the Editorial Review Board.

Title: The Spanish Gas Auction: A Precedent for Europe? 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2811;


***********************************************************************

A SMALL STEP FOR SPAIN, BUT AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR EUROPE

The recent auction of contract gas in Spain represents an early initiative both 
to release gas from preexisting long-term contracts and to make it available to 
aspiring market entrants. As such, CERA believes it could provide a precedent 
for other European markets (and for their regulators) where release gas 
programs have not so far been on the public agenda. 

*  The Spanish gas release program, as currently devised, will have limited 
impact on domestic competition. However, pressure will grow in Spain to extend 
the program.

*  By setting a unique precedent across Continental Europe, Spain has signaled 
a possible path for the reforms needed on the supply-side to complete the 
European gas internal market.

*  The role of credit risk and sovereign guarantees will be critical in any 
reallocation or renegotiation of long-term contracts.

Electricity Trading Builds Oh-So Slowly In France
By Sarah Wachter

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Although electricity trading volumes are creeping higher 
in France, activity will probably remain subdued and irregular until a 
satisfactory regulatory regime is put in place. 
Traders complain about the uncertainty caused by the temporary rules of grid 
operator RTE, and about tariffs for access to the network. Volumes won't take 
off without well-designed, permanent rules, they said.
Even then Europe's second-largest electricity market may never become much of 
a trading hub because of the dominance of state utility Electricity de France 
(F.EDF) which, with its huge installed nuclear capacity, is already among 
Europe's cheapest electricity suppliers. 
""There's so much missing,"" said Katrin Durwald, an energy analyst with HEW 
Energy Trading, talking about RTE's tariffs and rules.""Nothing is really 
clear in France,"" she said. 
Traders are especially upset over RTE's congestion costs, which only new 
market entrants share and which can add as much as 50% to the price of 
electricity. 
Other traders say access charges to the medium- to low-voltage network are 
impossible to figure out. But permanent tariffs won't go into effect until 
July 1 at the earliest, French electricity regulator CRE says. 
Permanent grid rules won't reach the regulator's desk for review until early 
summer, reckons RTE President Andre Merlin. 
Even with clearer regulation, the dominance of EDF will hold back the market. 
Former monopoly supplier EDF is a formidable competitor, a predominantly 
nuclear power producer with some of the lowest electricity prices in Europe. 
Traders estimate between 20 and 50 trades are going through monthly in 
France, mostly for electricity delivered the next day or next week. 
That's a far cry from neighboring Germany before the launch of spot 
electricity exchanges there, when 160 short-term transactions were struck 
daily, HEW Energy Trading estimates. 
More immediately, what's missing in France is a steady stream of one-year 
supply deals, a sign that foreign power companies are regularly furnishing 
electricity to French industrial consumers. 
""I seriously doubt whether there are companies taking risk and supplying 
customers,"" a trader with a large European power company said. 
French high-voltage grid operator RTE said 325 grid access contracts were 
signed this year for all transactions, as of March 12, equilavent to an 
average of four of five deals a day. 
There are, nonetheless, some pockets of activity in France. 
Traders are exchanging blocks of electricity to help industrial consumers 
curb costly imbalance charges, by grouping the companies' electricity needs 
to even out consumption patterns. 
RTE says 21 companies are authorized to furnish or buy back imbalance 
electricity. 
Swiss hydro producers are also exporting spot electricity to France, analysts 
said, notably Elektrizitaetsgesellschaft Laufenburg AG (Z.EGL) and 
Aare-Tessin AG fuer Elektrizitaet (Z.AAR). 
""Germany and France are the biggest export countries for Swiss spot hydro,"" 
Durwald said. 
At the same time, two Dutch energy distributors, NUON NV (N.NUN) and REMU NV, 
have been active in France, traders said. 
NUON purchased a few small hydroelectric producers, which are bound under an 
eight-year contract to sell electricity exclusively to EDF. 
But NUON can sell electricity to new customers above the contract price EDF 
is obliged to pay under its single buyer obligation, Durwald said. 
Some traders see opportunities cropping up this year from changes to the way 
transport capacity is allocated on France's interconnectors with the U.K. and 
with Italy. 
""Cogenerators (gas-fired power plants) in France with surplus capacity could 
sell to traders in Germany looking to import electricity into Italy,"" a 
trader at a large pan-European trading organization said. 
RTE forbids electricity ordered and delivered on the same day sourced from 
Germany and Switzerland to be imported to Italy. 
That trader also expects the daily transfer capacity auction on the 
U.K.-France Interconnector, which starts March 31, to spark more electricity 
trading in both countries. 
""The day-ahead risk is rather limited, not only in France but also in the 
U.K.,"" he said. 
The following are traders and power companies said to be active in France, in 
addition to those concerns already mentioned in the article, according to a

475,"I talked to Tracy Fairchild today about Edelman's efforts on behalf of ARM 
and the Direct Access Coalition and learned the following:

The DA Coalition is willing to take media calls -- Tracy has identified 
coalition members who will talk to the media, and she is forwarding to me the 
list of these members and their contact information.  The three lead 
organizations in the coalition are the California Retailers Association, the 
California Chamber of Commerce and the California Manufacturers and 
Technology Association.

Since February, these key members have changed their position on whether to 
participate in a press conference, and now they do not want to participate in 
a media event.  The reason is that there are other energy issues they're 
working on with legislators that they feel are more important than direct 
access (rate increase unfairly targets large businesses, interruptible 
issues, etc.).  They fear that if they participate in a direct access press 
conference, that issue will appear to be more important to them than these 
other issues.  In addition, there is now a desire by these organizations to 
distance themselves from ESPs because of the turnback of customers.  Many of 
the businesses are not thrilled with how direct access has worked, and ESPs 
are viewed as the bad guys. Furthermore, these business organizations view a 
press conference as offensive to the legislature and governor.

One universal comment that Tracy had received from the DA Coalition and ARM 
members is that any event should not include Enron participation.  The UC/CSU 
issue has really painted us in a bad light, and no one wants to be associated 
with us.

Tracy has been pleading for customers who are willing to talk about direct 
access, and she is starting to get a few.  Once she has customers, she 
believes she can pull together a press conference.  The target date is the 
week of April 16, although that may change so it doesn't coincide w/ the 
investigation hearings.

ARM has been talking about introducing its own bill.  She'll keep me posted 
on this.

Early on, Tracy had been successful pitching the retail story.  She's now 
working on a second mainstream media pitch about the conflict surrounding 
direct access: legislation is needed to fix AB1X, the utilities want to kill 
direct access, businesses want choice,  ARM has been screwed by Bowen (i'm 
sure she'll soften this angle) and  CDWR has concerns about direct access.

I'll pass along any new information as I receive it.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
04/05/2001


GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS DELIVERS
ADDRESS TO CALIFORNIANS ON
ENERGY

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis today delivered
an important live address on energy from his office in
Sacramento. The following are his
remarks as prepared for delivery:

""Good evening. I'm speaking to you
tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing
California: our energy crisis.

""Simply stated, we have two problems:
supply is too low and costs are too high. Both result from the
flawed deregulation scheme created in
1996. But no matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to
solve problems. And that's what I'm
doing.

""The only long-term solution is to
build more power plants. We must also cut back on consumption and
stabilize the utilities. But prices
won't fall and supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more
power than we consume.

""Yet in the 12 years before I took
office, not a single major power plant was built in California. Not one.
Since I became Governor, we've
licensed 12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And
we're doing this without weakening
our commitment to clean air and clean water.

""Deregulation required the utilities
to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating
companies. The generators are free to
charge whatever they want because they're governed only by
federal regulators who refuse to
control wholesale energy prices.

""This past winter, the prices charged
by the generators shot through the roof, driving the utilities to the
brink of bankruptcy.

""In January, with the feds still
refusing to do their job, California stepped in to purchase the power the
utilities could no longer afford to
buy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep the
power on and the economy strong.
That's not all:

We also negotiated long-term
contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices.
I used my emergency powers to
seize control of low-cost power contracts the utilities were
about to forfeit to the
generators.
We began negotiations to buy the
utilities' transmission system.
We cut red tape and offered cash
incentives to speed up construction of power plants.
We're launching an $800 million
conservation program.
We're moving to establish a
public power authority to build more power. If the private sector fails
to build all the plants
California needs, we'll build them ourselves.
And because I share your concern
that the generators are ripping us off, we're using every legal
remedy to root out and punish
illegal conduct.

""We can't fix 12 years of inaction
overnight. But we're making real progress.

""Now, as you know, I have fought
tooth and nail against raising rates. It's become increasingly clear,
however, that with rising natural gas
prices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack of
supply, that some rate increases are
needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong.

""But I remain committed to protecting
average Californians from massive rate hikes. So I'm urging the
Public Utilities Commission to adopt
a plan that will protect average consumers, reward those who
conserve and motivate the biggest
users to cut back.

""Under my proposal, more than half of
you won't pay a penny more. For the rest, the average increase
will be 26 and a half percent. For
many of that group, rates will rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest
users will see their rates rise 34
and a half percent on average. That includes business paying their
share. This is in addition to the 9
percent surcharge we've all been paying since last winter.

""But all Californians can reduce
their bills through conservation.

""Here's the point: The more you use,
the more you pay. The more you conserve, the more you save.
Conservation is our best short-term
weapon against blackouts and price-gouging. By flexing your
power, you'll help secure our energy
future.

""Unlike the PUC, my plan includes
funds to restore the utilities to financial stability -- If they agree to
three main conditions:

""They must provide low-cost regulated
power to the state for 10 years. Agree to sell us their
transmission system. And dismiss
their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates.

""My proposal raises rates fairly,
assures us of long-term power, stabilizes the utilities and promotes
conservation.

""Our emphasis on conservation is
critical. In order to make it through the summer, we must cut
demand by at least 10 percent.

""Already we've launched programs to
cut back commercial lighting, and reduce consumption in office
buildings, schools and government
facilities.

""Friends, we have a power shortage
but we are far from powerless. We are 34 million strong and if
each of us does our part, we can
minimize disruptions and get through the summer. We are
Californians. We've withstood
earthquakes, floods, fires, and droughts.

""Yes, this mess is man-made, but with
your help and God's blessing, we'll get through this as well.

""Thank you and good night.""

I wanted to talk with first thing on Friday about our decision to weigh in 
with testimony in this case.  Forgetting the question Legal may or may not 
have (let's assume they don't have any concerns) about Scott testifying, it 
is still my opinion that we should not file testimony.

First, I assume that you have already marked your book to the Lynch 
""thoughts"" on rate design and revenue allocation included in the initial 
Order.   I make this assumption, because the loss to EES has already occurred 
and our goal now is to try and bring back some of the value by (a) focusing 
on revenue sharing and (b) rate design.  Scott indicates that the loss could 
be $100MM with bad outcomes on the 2 key issues.  My purpose of EES' activity 
is to try and minimize that number.  I feel that a quiet but forceful role in 
the case is the best vehicle given our recent troubles in CA and before the 
CPUC.

Second, I am not sure that Govt Affairs is comfortable with Scott's model of 
rate design.  While tiering of rates is on the table, the question of demand 
reduction payback under his framework could result in customers using 70% of 
their load and paying nothing.  That hardly makes sense.  Now maybe we just 
don't understand, but putting in testimony that is unclear or confusing isn't 
going to win the day before the CPUC.

Third, most of our victory will come from aligning with the big users.  If we 
are supporting / defending our own testimony (which they haven't seen), I 
think that our ability to work through a Settlement will be limited.  Our 
goal is to ""pick and choose"" from the best solutions proposed while trying to 
highlight other options through cross-examination (granted, this may be very 
hard).

Fourth, someone may try to get EES to weigh in on the allocation of these 
costs to DA customers.  We have agreed not to take on that issue.  Scott 
doesn't get to use the Fifth Amendment to not answer.

Scott and his team is preparing testimony.  Give me a call.  If Scott and you 
are intent on moving forward, we'll do as you see fit within the other 
constraints.

485,"Jennifer;

Just a little more info with regard to the San Diego rate freeze 
legislation.  SB 43 (the Alpert bill) was signed by the Governor April 6 and 
filed with the Secretary of State April 9.  The language in the bill provides 
that the frozen rate would apply to the energy component of electric bills 
for electricity supplied to all customers by SDG&E not subject to the ceiling 
imposed by existing law (ie residential, small commercial and street 
lighting).  Review of that language would imply the rate freeze would not 
apply to direct access customers.  One caveat however.  The CPUC must now 
implement the passed legislation through its regulations.  While the intent 
of the legislation seems clear, the past record of the CPUC in implementing 
such legislative acts does not provide 100% assurance that logic will prevail.

As a footnote to the above, AB 43 (Correa - passing the Assembly and Senate 
April 5) is a ""companion clean-up"" bill to SB 43.  This bill is almost 
identical to SB 43 but reflects some limited technical corrections to SB 43.  
To our knowledge, as of yesterday, AB 43 had not been signed by the Governor.

In addition, there have been repeated questions with regard to the 
applicability of the 3 cent surcharge to direct access customers.  
Unfortunately, the status of its applicability is still up in the air.  
Various parties have raised this issue directly with the CPUC and in their 
comments with respect to the rate design phase of its implementation and will 
be one of the issues to be addressed (though perhaps not answered) next week 
in the Commission's rate design hearing.

487,"I like the idea, particularly if we can time any decision to turn the

(instead of after our earnings release).   

The only problem I see is that we would need a decision from the top that 
we're not going to turn the customers back if we get direct access (so we can 
end the debate).  I don't think it helps us if we get lucky, get direct 
access back, then make a decision to return customers to the utility.

489,"Sorry guys:

My other email account will not let me send.

I have really dropped the ball on this one.  I have been looking at your
stuff all morning and it appears to be pretty good.  I like the model for the
projections.  One point that I think was missed a little (although Jeff
addressed it somewhat in his revisions to Mark's comments) is the risk to
Netscape of going ahead with the $28 value.  I have been looking in the case
and have not found if this is a firm commitment placing or the best effort
type.  Obviously from Netscape's stand point, if it is a firm commitment then
the higher the sale price that is underwritten the better.  It will provide
more equity funding.  This may not be beneficial to the current shareholder's
given Jeff's Hot Issue comments.

Looking at the comparable recent IPOs (particularly UUnet), it appears that
there is enough evidence to support letting it out at $28.  The issue is
about the same size and the financials are roughly comparable.  UUnet was
actually selling less and losing more than Netscape.  Although the increase
in price on the day of issue is a little misleading since it is only a small
portion of shares, UUnet appears to have sustained the stock price level of
at least a few months (and it has increased further).

Anyway, I think I remember that Netscape did go for it and it IPO'd at $28
and close at over $70 on the first day.  Is this what Greenspan meant by
irrational exhurberants?

I am about to do the Easter thing and then drive home.  I will not be there
until after 8.  I do not want to put more time on Jimmy waiting for me.  I
will look at the finished product and try and hold my comments to a minimum.
Since I dropped the ball, I will take the lead on the last one to make it up

Belden is due back from vacation on Monday.  The West desk would not give me 
any valuation estimates until Tim returned.

EES

PTR, Phase I  
Enron was the only party that raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an 
artificial cap on the PX credit for direct customers (RAP '98).  The CPUC 
shined us on. Later, we ensured that it became part of ARM's case in PTR 
Phase I. The way the ""cap"" worked, the UDCs would not pay ESPs the full PX 
credit when prices were high -- they would pay a credit that, when added to 
the other bill components, did not exceed the frozen rate for the direct 
access customer, thereby costing ESPs potentially a lot of  money.  It was 
clear in the previous CPUC direct access decisions that UDCs had no right to 
cap direct access credits. Because of our good case and the fact that the 
UDCs believed the chance of such high PX prices was LOW, the UDCs settled 
with ARM on this issue in 1999.

2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $30 - 40 million
% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 90%

Green Credit Legislation
Enron and other green suppliers began work in 1998 to extend the credit given 
for sales of green power. The credit was scheduled to end by 2002. In 1999, 
the money specified in AB 1890 was being depleted rapidly and Green Mountain 
took the lead in pressing for legislation. We actively supported Green 
Mountain by lobbying legislators and other interest groups, working with 
envrionmental organizations, and spearheading legislative amendments.  
Although this bill became wrapped up in the San Diego crisis and ISO/PX 
issues, the green credit portion of the bill remained intact.  We had also 
decided jointly to propose a ten-year credit and were very pleased and 
surprised that it survived into the final bill.  Governor Davis is expected 
to sign the bill. 

2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $50 million
% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 25%

RAP '99
Enron, through ARM, has successfully made its case that retail procurement 
and retail sales costs should be removed from the Distribution Charge that 
all customers pay.  Direct Access customers would receive a credit on their 
bills in addition to the PX credit. Enron was the first party to raise these 
issues as part of RAP '98 and got a Commission decision in that case to 
determine the credit in RAP '99.  In RAP '99, Enron chose to use ARM to 
litigate the case as a cheaper alternative.  Hearings were completed in the 
Spring of 2000.  ARM has negotiated settlement rates with certain parties and 
has convinced the Assigned Commissioner to draft his own decision to 
counteract the unfavorable ALJ decision. An additional credit of from $0.25 
to $0.30/MWh is expected.  The decision will be voted out within the next two 
months.

FTR Release April 1, 2000
I have spearheaded the release of firm transmission rights in CA since I 
joined the Company in 11/96.  Our long and painful fight with creeping 
nodalism culminated with the release of some, but not all, FTRs in April of 
this year.  ENA actively participated in the auction and became the largest 
single purchaser of FTRs.  The new congestion management approach, which 
Enron also spearheaded, will require 100% release of FTRs, but will not take 
effect until next year. This valuation looks only at the FTR release in 2000.

ISO Price Caps
ENA was long in the market in the West and had millions at risk when lower 
price caps began to be discussed in CA in mid June.  Government Affairs, 
working with Dave Parquet and others, was instrumental in significantly 
delaying the movement to lower price caps, thereby giving ENA time to move 
out of those positions.  The following events happened in 2000.  We entered 
the year with a price cap of $750, having fought to raise it to that level in 
1999.  In March 2000, the ISO considered lowering the price cap to $500 but 
voted to leave it at $500, because they believed at the time that market 
power had been adequately mitigated.  After the four very high-priced days in 
June, the ISO considered lowering the price cap to $250 with a vote on June 
22, but the vote failed by ONE VOTE. Instead, the Board lowered the price cap 
to $500.  The Board voted again on July 1 to lower the cap and again the vote 
failed by ONE VOTE.  Finally, on August 1, the Board approved the $250 price 
cap, effective August 7.  In June, Government Affairs intitiated an all-out 
lobbying effort to convince Board members and their constituents to oppose 
lower price caps.  We also lobbied interest groups, banks, venture 
capitalists, NYMEX and others to weigh in on this issue with individual Board 
Members and the Board itself, going so far as to set up a special arrangement 
with the ISO staff to allow interested parties to address the Board 
telephonically.

New Market-Oriented Board Member
The ISO recently held Board elections for the first time.  Government Affairs 
actively sought market-oriented individuals to run for the Board and replace 
those that do not support competitive markets.  Enron was successful in 
getting about five to run.  The Members selected or confrmed by the EOB have 
been held up and we do not yet know the outcome of those Board seats.  
However, one seat of interest has been decided.  Dave Parquet suggested a 
potential municipal representative who was extremely market-oriented (Michael 
Wood, City Attorney for the City of Pittsburgh).  Government Affairs worked 
with him closely to decide which seat to run for, help him prepare his 
application, suggest lobbying tactics, assist in lobbying and support him 
with other Board Members.  He won the election and became a Board Member in 
early September.  This effort is significant, because the munis voted nearly 
100% in support of lower price caps. The position he took was one of those 
votes.  All other things being equal, we have now added a vote on our side 
that could be instrumental in defeating further efforts to impose lower or 
additional price caps, given the close votes that have taken place thus far.

COMMODITIES & AGRICULTURE - Soft commodity traders find the going hard.
By ADRIENNE ROBERTS.

07/03/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Soft commodity traders find the going hard - Barriers to entry are daunting 
and the big incumbents are facing months of adaptation and belt tightening, 
says Adrienne Roberts. 
Profit margins in soft commodities trading are wafer-thin. ""The margins are 
to be found between the wallpaper and the wall,"" said the head of a European 
trading business.
""We are barely making a profit in cocoa, and we are one of the biggest 
participants in the market,"" said an executive at a leading London futures 
brokerage. 
Enron, the largest natural gas and electricity trading house in the US, 
announced recently that it is closing its London-based cocoa, sugar and 
coffee brokerage business following an internal company review. 
Members of the industry think the brokerage, Rudolf Wolff, was failing to 
generate enough cash. 
""US companies tend to be much more aggressive on the kind of returns they 
want from each desk. I'm not surprised Enron decided to pack it in,"" said a 
US trader. 
Enron says it is continuing to look into other opportunities in the softs 
industry. 
Part of the problem is depressed markets, with low prices and thin volumes. 
""Coffee is at a 30-year low, cocoa is flat at this time of year - I would say 
it's extremely challenging unless you have critical mass,"" said the head of a 
London softs desk. ""Merchants are the source of our income. If they're 
squeezed, they squeeze everyone."" 
Business conditions have been particularly difficult, for merchants sourcing 
from Cote d'Ivoire, a major coffee producer and the world's largest cocoa 
grower. Political upheaval and industry restructuring have reduced the 
volumes of stock coming on to the physical market. 
""The only answer is greater efficiency; lower costs,"" said a manager at a 
leading soft commodities merchant. 
Customers found a way of cutting their brokerage costs late last year when 
the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange took its 
commodity products electronic. 
Customers can now ask their brokers to provide them with trading screens, 
with uncomfortable effects on brokers' execution fees. 
A year ago, a client who wanted to buy 10 lots of coffee might telephone his 
broker, get some advice, hear the latest on the weather in Brazil or politics 
in Cote d'Ivoire, and have his trade executed by the broker. 
Now the client might connect directly to Liffe, put through his own trade 
electronically and receive the documentation via the web. He may not speak to 
his broker at all. 
Brokers earn a fee for providing the screens, but not as much as they would 
from execution. 
""Margins are under tremendous pressure in the futures business because of the 
move to electronic trading,"" said an executive at a London bank. 
""You're seeing the tip of the iceberg now. If electronic trading is having 
such a major effect on brokers in the softs market, what does it mean when 
metals and energy go electronic?"" 
The execution and advice functions, once part of the same package, have been 
separated. The question of where these clients will go for advice and what 
they are prepared to pay for it has not yet been answered. 
""The key to this business is volume,"" said Brian de Clare at ABN Amro. ""Your 
incremental cost is negligible - putting through 100,000 lots costs pretty 
much the same as 500,000 lots. High volumes, in conjunction with good 
service, will determine who's going to get the lion's share of the business 
and who won't."" 
ABN Amro is one of the few participants in the industry that is expanding its 
softs business and recruiting. 
Brokers think more people will begin dropping out of the market and there 
will be consolidation among those in the industry. There are rumours that 
Truxo, which belongs to the Neumann group, is thinking of withdrawing from 
clearing customer business. 
Head counts have come down since the demise of the open outcry trading pit, 
but some businesses are looking to streamline further. 
Commodities brokers that trade on the floor might have from four to seven 
support staff to each trader. In the softs business ""we're now starting to 
see that people who were in the office are not needed to the same degree 
because people have got their own screens"", said one. 
There is not much relief in sight. For smaller brokers, the barriers to entry 
are increasingly daunting. For the big incumbents there may be many months of 
adaptation and belt tightening ahead.

GLOBAL INVESTING - Enron looks to make power play in continental Europe.
By JULIE EARLE.

07/03/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Ten years ago Enron, the US energy giant, derived its profit purely from its 
home market and from a few projects in the UK. It operated pipelines and 
produced power. 
Today, the Houston-based company has recreated itself as a global energy 
merchant, selling and delivering gas and electricity, and its profits are 
increasingly produced offshore.
Having consolidated its position in the UK, Enron is making a big push into 
continental Europe to capture the growth potential in deregulating energy 
markets. 
The company moved into the energy selling business with the deregulation in 
the US of gas in 1994 and electricity in 1996. It now has projects in more 
than 40 countries. The change in strategy, away from owning infrastructure 
and towards energy selling, has seen its earnings drift away from pipelines 
in the US towards a rapidly growing wholesale gas and power business. 
Enron does not release its revenue breakdown but it is clear from its volumes 
that the wholesale unit - which involves energy trading and marketing and 
risk management services - generates about 85 per cent of the company's 
profits. 
A third of the company's wholesale business comes from Europe, including the 
UK, and Enron is focused on growing in France and Europe as a whole. Its 
pipeline business in the US, once the engine of its growth, now comprises 
four interstate natural gas pipelines and represents less than 10 per cent of 
earnings. 
Enron uses its assets to supply customer power needs. It also has power 
stations in the US, UK, Italy, Poland, Turkey and Spain. 
Enron is aggressively eyeing Germany, France, the UK and the Nordic region 
for opportunities offered by deregulation. 
The company has seen growth quadruple in its wholesale business in Europe in 
the past year alone. Enron does not reveal a geographical breakdown of its 
revenue but its physical volumes of gas traded in Europe leapt from 2,469bn 
btu (British thermal units) of gas a day in the first quarter of 1999 to 
8,699bn btu in the same period a year later. 
Growth in electricity traded was even stronger, jumping from 7,844 megawatt 
hours in 1999 to 36,339 in the first quarter of last year. Those figures also 
include small gas and electricity volumes for Australia and Japan, which are 
relatively new markets for Enron. 
Ray Niles, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney in New York, says that while 
the UK was important, continental Europe was the key prize. The total gas 
power market in the US is worth $300bn in revenue while Europe is worth 
$250bn. Analysts will be looking to Enron's second quarter results, due on 
July 12, after the company posted $406m in first-quarter profits, a 20 per 
cent increase. Key areas of interest are likely to centre on its wholesale 
business in Europe.

EOTT Energy Partners said yesterday that it paid $120 million for energy 
assets from affiliates of the energy marketer and trader, Enron. EOTT, based 
in Houston, has bought a hydrocarbon processing complex in Morgan's Point, 
Tex., and a liquids pipeline grid system, as well as a natural gas liquids 
storage facility. EOTT also entered into a 10-year agreement for production 
from the hydrocarbon processing complex, and arranged a 10-year storage and 
transportation agreement for use of the pipeline and storage systems. Dana 
Gibbs, president of EOTT Energy Corporation, a general partner of EOTT Energy 
Partners, said that the acquisition would add to earnings.

EOTT Energy Partners said Monday that it is paying Enron Corp. approximately 
$120 million for an MTBE plant in Morgan's Point, a natural gas liquids 
storage facility in Mont Belvieu and a pipeline grid for carrying the 
liquids. 
The processing facility, which averages 14,000 to 15,000 barrels per day of 
the gasoline additive, properly known as methyl tertiary butyl ether, is one 
of the largest plants of its type in the United States. It also produces a 
smaller quantity of isobutylene.
The pipeline grid, which totals 240 miles of pipe, connects the storage 
facility in Mont Belvieu to the MTBE plant, and to similar plants along the 
Houston Ship Channel. 
The natural gas liquids storage facility has 10 million barrels of capacity. 
Simultaneously with the purchase, EOTT signed a 10-year agreement to sell the 
production from the MTBE plant to Enron, plus a 10-year storage and 
transportation agreement for the use of the storage facility and pipelines. 
This agreement has Enron providing the feedstock and taking the plant's 
output, paying EOTT a fee for producing the fuel additive. 
The acquisition provides greater diversity for EOTT Energy Partners, which is 
a major marketer and transporter of crude, said spokeswoman Gina Taylor. The 
deal will boost earnings and provide stable cash flows without exposure to 
commodity markets and prices, said Dana Gibbs, the president of EOTT Energy, 
its general partner. 
The partnership's common units, which are traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange, gained 15 cents to close Monday at $18.55. 
EOTT Energy Partners is a publicly traded company whose general partner is a 
100 percent-owned subsidiary of Enron.

Ads Brawl in a Never-Ending Political Season
By ALISON MITCHELL

07/03/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, July 1 -- With jittery House Republicans complaining that 
President Bush is losing the important opening skirmishes over energy policy, 
a political rescue squad has hit the California airwaves. 
A new group, the American Taxpayers Alliance, led by Scott Reed, the campaign 
manager for Bob Dole's 1996 presidential race, began running 30-second 
commercials in California a few weeks ago blaming the state's Democratic 
governor for the state's power problems.
''Grayouts from Gray Davis,'' the tagline of the television advertisements 
says. 
Mr. Reed said his group, whose donors he would not name, had spent $2 million 
on the commercials. 
Another new coalition is also preparing advertisements on the energy front, 
taking on environmentalists for standing in the way of energy production. The 
coalition, the 21st Century Energy Project, was assembled by Ed Gillespie, a 
former campaign strategist for President Bush. And supporters and opponents 
of patients' rights legislation before Congress are taking to the airwaves in 
the Congressional recess. 
The barrage of commercials shows that the permanent campaign that was the 
hallmark of the Clinton years is here to stay. Mr. Bush may have promised to 
change the tone in Washington and end the divisive mentality of constant 
confrontation, but the year-round media battle over issues and ideas has 
never stopped. And some of his former campaign advisers and strategists are 
in the fray. 
The volume of advertisements was even intense during the first 100 days of 
the Bush presidency, usually a time of relative peace in politics. 
''There was significantly more television advertising in the first six months 
of this administration than there was in the past,'' said Ken Goldstein, a 
professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, who studies 
such trends. 
The Democratic National Committee is unabashedly on a war footing, although 
the size of its advertising purchases -- several hundred thousand dollars' 
worth this year -- has not matched the volume of its oratory. 
The Democrats marked Mr. Bush's first 100 days with a commercial featuring a 
winsome blond tyke holding up a glass and cooing, ''May I please have some 
more arsenic in my water, Mommy?'' Last week, the Democratic National 
Committee broadcast a new spot, saying, ''Insurance companies. H.M.O.'s. Big 
corporations. They've contributed $51 million to Bush and the Republicans. 
And now Bush says he'll veto a real patients' bill of rights.'' 
Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is boastful 
about such early advertising. ''It's never been done before,'' he said, 
promising ''a very aggressive full-time campaign.'' 
The Republican National Committee has so far resisted going on the air so 
early before the midterm elections. 
''It's a judgment call you have to make -- whether paid media is best to 
spend now, next year or whenever,'' said Trent Duffy, a party spokesman. 
''You might think it's corny,'' Mr. Duffy added, ''but it's a part of the 
president changing the tone.'' 
One White House official said Mr. Bush's political team did not believe that 
commercials this early in a political cycle had any lasting effect. And he 
said the fact that an array of industries and Bush allies were on the air 
also made it easy for the Republican National Committee to stay quiet. 
''If other parties are out there making the same point,'' the official said, 
''why spend your own money?'' 
Federal laws leave issue advertisements largely unregulated unless there is 
coordination between a group and a candidate or party. But the standard for 
proving coordination is high. 
''There are so many reliable allies out there, you don't need to 
coordinate,'' said Ken Gross, an expert in election law. ''The party 
committee can put up on its Web site what its agenda is and the outside 
groups can go to town.'' 
And so they have, from the earliest days of the Bush presidency. The Sierra 
Club went on radio and television in January to fight the nomination of Gale 
A. Norton as interior secretary. One advertisement called Ms. Norton ''an 
anti-environmental extremist who could divide us, who is out of step with the 
majority of Americans.'' 
The Republican Majority Issues Committee, using mirror-image language, 
defended the nomination of John Ashcroft for attorney general with television 
advertisements that proclaimed, ''Party partisan extremists won't give our 
new president a new chance.'' 
Some groups choose to give their allies in the White House or Congress a 
heads-up when they take to the airwaves. Mark Lampkin, a former aide in the 
Bush campaign, informed the White House when a coalition he worked with, 
Americans for Better Education, ran two rounds of radio advertisements to 
promote Mr. Bush's education program. 
''To protect both sides of the equation,'' Mr. Lampkin said, ''we were very 
conscious of not discussing these things or having a lot of interaction.'' 
Stephen Moore, whose Club for Growth ran television advertisements promoting 
the president's tax cut, said he deliberately did not have contact with 
either the White House or Republican leaders in Congress. 
''We want to give them plausible deniability so they can say we have no idea 
they are going to attack Specter,'' Mr. Moore said, referring to Senator 
Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania. 
One round of the advertisements lampooned, as friends of the Internal Revenue 
Service, Republican Senate moderates who were skeptical of the tax cut, 
including Mr. Specter, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and James M. Jeffords 
of Vermont, before he became an independent. 
While the Democrats' positions are often amplified by groups like the 
environmental and labor movements, Congressional Republicans have made clear 
in recent years that they expect industry allies to be on the air creating 
public support for votes in their favor. 
A Republican strategist said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority 
whip, had recently told officials of the energy industry that Republicans 
were not here to defend them and that they needed to defend themselves. Mr. 
DeLay, the strategist said, warned the officials that they were in danger of 
losing the public relations war. 
Asked about those warnings, Emily Miller, a spokeswoman for Mr. DeLay, said 
energy officials were ''one group of many'' that Mr. DeLay had talked to as 
energy-policy point man in the Republican leadership. 
''Congressman DeLay has been telling everyone about the need for us to do a 
better job in communicating our energy message and the need for a 
comprehensive national energy policy,'' Ms. Miller said. 
Sometimes because of the web of relationships in Washington and minimal 
disclosure requirements, it is difficult to tell when an issue advocacy 
effort is actually an industry effort. 
Mr. Reed says his American Taxpayers Alliance has more than 10,000 donors and 
is on a political mission: to shield vulnerable Congressional Republicans 
from any blame for how Washington responds to California's energy crisis and 
to put the focus on Mr. Davis. 
''We could single-handedly lose the House if California gets blown away,'' 
Mr. Reed said. 
Yet it is also the case, several Republicans said, that energy interests have 
contributed to Mr. Reed's advertising campaign. 
Alex Castellanos, the maker of the advertisements, is the head of National 
Media, a firm that also produced a radio and television spot this spring for 
Arctic Power, a group pushing Mr. Bush's call for drilling in the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge. 
Mr. Castellanos, who produced the Republican National Committee's 
advertisements in the last presidential campaign, said in a brief interview 
that he did not discuss his clients. 
Mr. Gillespie, whose 21st Century Energy Project is planning a television 
campaign, also represents the Enron Corporation, the nation's biggest 
electricity trader. He said the two accounts were separate. 
He said his group was reacting because it believed that the environmental 
groups had been on the air unchallenged. 
''There has been a vacuum in the energy debate,'' he said, ''and the liberal 
groups like the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, who 
are not sufficiently understood to be pawns of the Democratic National 
Committee, have had a free ride in this debate.'' 
Phil Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, said 
environmentalists started advertising because they had watched industry pour 
millions of dollars into such campaigns before. 
''We fully expect that on a variety of environmental issues ranging from 
energy to the Clean Air Act,'' Mr. Clapp said, ''that we will see these kinds 
of industry campaigns, and we felt it was best to be there first.''

JAPAN: S.Korea SAROK buys 10,000 tns of western aluminium.

07/03/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, July 3 (Reuters) - South Korea's Supply Administration (SAROK) bought 
10,000 tonnes of western primary aluminium ingots late last week from Samsung 
Corp and Enron Corp , traders said on Tuesday. 
The government procurement body bought 5,000 tonnes from Enron last Thursday 
at $1,509 a tonne on a cost-insurance-freight basis to the southeastern port 
of Pusan, a trade source in Seoul said.
The administration had bought another 5,000 tonnes from Samsung at $1,501.89 
a tonne, CIF, to the western port of Inchon, he said. 
Premiums were estimated at about $47-$55 a tonne over the London Metal 
Exchange (LME) cash prices, another source said. 
Shipment was set for within two months after the suppliers received a letter 
of credit from SAROK, he said.

India: FIs, banks favour AES taking over Dabhol

07/03/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

BANGALORE, July 2. FINANCIAL institutions (FIs) and banks have indicated that 
they would be favourably inclined to a takeover of the Dabhol Power Company's 
(DPC) equity by another American energy major, AES. AES has already indicated 
that it could takeover Enron's equity and run the power plant. 
FI sources said here that this takeover would be in the best interests of all 
the parties involved in the project, including consumers. This was in view of 
AES's experiences in Orissa. AES operates the Orissa Power Generation 
Corporation Ltd in which it has a 49 per cent stake.
AES also runs a distribution company - Centco, in that State. 
The sources said that takeover by AES could also help DPC reduce some of the 
debt financing costs - both in phase one and phase two. The debt portion in 
phase one (826 MW) is about $644 million. 
In phase two (1,624 MW) the debt financing component is about $1.414 billion. 
All these loans have been raised at interest rates in the region of 250-350 
basis points over the LIBOR. In the second phase especially, the debt 
financing costs were high since it came close on the heels of the Pokhran 
nuclear test. 
The sources said that if these loans could be refinanced, then the interest 
burden on the project could be brought down substantially. 
The sources estimated that given the credit rating of AES in international 
financial markets, the DPC loans could be refinanced at spreads of just 100 
basis points over LIBOR. 
Besides, rates for external commercial borrowings have considerably softened 
in the last few months. In fact, the last few loans that have been raised in 
the international markets by top Indian corporates without sovereign 
guarantees have all been at spreads of under 100 basis points. 
The sources said that the AES takeover could also stave off invocation of the 
deferred payment guarantees (DPG). In both phases, the guarantee obligations 
of the domestic FIs and public sector banks are close to $800 million. 
Technically, foreign creditors could invoke these guarantees in the event of 
payment defaults by DPC. In addition, FIs and banks have direct exposure of 
about $429 million in both phases. 
The sources said that invocation of the guarantees and a simultaneous 
classification of loans into non-performing assets, would hurt the balance 
sheets of the FIs as well as the banks. The banks likely to be impacted 
include the State Bank of India and Canara Bank which have participated in 
both the foreign currency as well as the rupee loan syndications of DPC. 
The sources said that the only alternative to prevent any drastic impact on 
the FIs was to either find a resolution to the current stand-off between MSEB 
and Enron or allow other companies, acceptable to lending institutions to buy 
out the DPC equity from Enron. 
The sources said that taking over the management of DPC could be considered 
only as a last resort by the FIs. This can be technically done, since the FIs 
have a physical asset cover on the fixed assets of DPC on both phase one and 
phase two as part of loan and guarantee covenants.

MUMBAI, July 2. THE Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has 
given the State electricity board two weeks to prove the confidentiality of 
documents related to Enron's Dabhol power project, at the hearing of a 
petition filed by Prayas, a Pune- based non-government organisation. 
The commission has also asked MSEB to clarify its stand on MERC making the 
documents public.
Prayas had filed a petition asking for the status and copies of various power 
purchase agreements signed by the board with independent power producers, 
including Dabhol Power Company. 
MSEB, in turn, had said that DPC had claimed contractual confidentiality over 
several documents which could not be made public. MERC had given the board 
four weeks to submit the relevant documents. 
The commission has now given the board an additional two weeks to submit the 
documents.

India: New power Bill set to free captive generation

Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, July 2. THE Union Power Ministry is thinking of completely freeing 
captive power generation. Mr Ajay Shankar, Joint Secretary, Union Power 
Ministry, said here that the Electricity Bill, which is likely to be 
introduced in Parliament ""soon"", would liberalise captive generation. 
""To ensure this, the Centre is in the process of giving guidelines to the 
State Governments under the present laws and will provide for it under the 
new law,"" Mr Shankar said.
Mr Shankar urged industry to invest in transmission and distribution to boost 
power sector reforms. 
Speaking to newspersons after an interactive session with industry 
representatives organised by the Indian Merchants' Chamber here on Monday, Mr 
Shankar said the Government would push for privatisation of distribution in 
the Electricity Bill. 
Speaking at the function, the State Energy Secretary, Mr V.M. Lal, said the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board was still the best in the country ""minus 
Enron"". ""All the problems created by that project (Dabhol) are coming in the 
way of reforming the power sector in the State,"" Mr Lal said. 
Mr Adi Engineer, Managing Director, Tata Power, said the most important thing 
in reforming the sector was speed. ""Debate alone is not enough. 
What we need is speed. And, instead of difficult ones, the Government should 
start with easier propositions in transmission and distribution. 
For example, islands of industrial activity such as Nagpur could be 
privatised first. Besides, the Government should also de-politicise new 
projects,"" he added. 
Mr Shankar said the second part of the Montek Singh Ahluwalia report on power 
sector restructuring is expected shortly, while an ""empowered committee"", 
including Mr Suresh Prabhu, Union Power Minister, is looking into the 
implementation of the first part of the report, he said. 
The Secretary declined comment on the ""active role of facilitator"" being 
played by the Centre in the Enron renegotiation process. 
He also said that the metering of 11 KV stations across the country would be 
completed by March 2002 while metering of other customers would be completed 
within two years.

India Inc steps up social works, but ...
Shalini Singh

07/03/2001
The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

AT A recent investor meet, Tata Steel MD J J Irani asked his investors if 
they felt the company should reconsider its social work profile. The 
unanimous response was to step up investments in the area. 
The rationale: a social return on capital with a clear impact on the 
bottomline.
``You cant be an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty, says Tisco 
spokesperson Shakti Sharma. ``It creates a social pressure on the company, 
she adds. 
A fortnight ago, on June 22, the day after the Kaduldi Express crashed into 
the river in remote Kadalundi in Kerala, among the people who rushed to the 
site of the disaster were two teams from the Kozhikode operations of the 
cellular phone company, Escotel. 
And in the dead of night, they set up an antenna on a coconut tree. By 
midnight, survivors, rescue workers, medics, policemen and even railway 
minister Nitish Kumar were using the jerry-rigged mobile phone infrastructure 
to call friends, relatives and colleagues all for free. 
On January 26, when Gujarat was flattened in 90 seconds by the earthquake, a 
free phone facility set up by Care India, Bharti BT and Cisco for domestic 
and overseas calls provided the most immediate emotional relief for relatives 
anxious for news about their families. 
Increasingly, Corporate India is becoming conscious of being a good citizen. 
And its discovering, to its surprise, that this image makeover effort 
actually makes a mark on people from all walks of life. 
This has driven industry chambers to take time out from lobbying ministers 
and hosting cocktail lunches to demonstrate interest in social development. 
CII has committed Rs 100 crore to help 26 quake-hit villages in Gujarat. It 
has also set up a `disaster management committee this year. And Ficci 
partners CARE to rebuild at least 10,000 homes in the state. 
With greater corporate involvement in socially helpful activity, CARE has 
raised $28 million for the rehabilitation of 30 villages in the worst 
affected areas of Gujarat. 
Of this, Care India director Tom Alcedo says, Ficci mobilised about 15 to 20 
per cent from its members. 
This human face of India Inc appears to be confined largely to emergency 
relief, though. 
In Gujarat, for instance, Alcedo says the corporate sector displayed more 
compassion initially, but dropped out in the rehabilitation stage. 
But NGOs say firms have realised that long-term social development could 
boost bottomlines as well. 
The Tata Group understood this long ago the social cell at Tata Steel has an 
annual budget of Rs 38 crore, says Mrs Sharma. 
Alcedo says, ``Enron got involved in community development in Maharashtra and 
Gujarat because it realised that overlooking social development issues in 
Dabhol had caused a lot of strife. 
Today, corporate compassion is motivated largely by tax breaks and publicity 
mileage rather than in sustained community development work which doesnt 
attract as much media attention.

Cheney raised Dabhol issue with Sonia
The Times of India News Service

07/03/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

NEW DELHI: US vice-president Dick Cheney expressed concern over the ongoing 
dispute between the Maharashtra government and US power giant Enron, promoter 
of the Dabhol Power Project, during his meeting with Congress president Sonia 
Gandhi in Washington, DC, last week. 
Senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh, who had accompanied Sonia on her US 
visit, briefed presspersons Monday about Sonia's first foreign trip as the 
leader of the Opposition. Singh said the reference to Enron came up when 
Cheney spoke of the growing Indo-US economic relations and mentioned that 
America wanted strong investments in India.
Singh sought to play down the fact that Cheney had evinced such inordinate 
interest in the Enron case. ``He brought it up and we explained our position 
and the matter was allowed to rest there,'' Singh said. What Singh left 
unsaid was that the Enron project being mentioned by an official as senior as 
the US vice-president indicates the level of concern in the US about the 
viability of India as an attractive foreign investment destination. 
Questions about the Enron project were also asked during Sonia's meeting at 
the Asia Society, Singh said. ``I explained that one could not wish away the 
problems which have arisen. The demand projections have gone haywire while 
the cost of tariff has turned out to be much too high, partly because of the 
rise in the prices of feedstock and partly due to the depreciation of the 
exchange rate,'' Singh recounted. He said he had also clarified that the real 
problem was the high cost of tariff and that a mutually satisfactory way of 
reducing it had to be found. 
Singh said the Congress president's meetings with Cheney and US National 
Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice also dwelt on the National Missile Defence 
(NMD) programme. Sonia expressed fears it could lead to an arms race in the 
region. The Indian side also said that the programme still contains several 
uncertain elements which need to be explained. The Congress delegation 
pointed out the Chinese, Russians and the Europeans too have their 
differences on the issue. The American officials, said Singh, explained that 
they were in the process of engaging their allies and the Russians on this 
issue. 
On the country's economy, Singh said it had slowed down substantially and, 
yet, the finance minister had presented a budget pegging the GDP growth rate 
at 6.1 per cent while the real figures show a sharp deceleration to 5.2 per 
cent. 
Singh said the last three years of BJP rule had seen a progressive 
deceleration in the GDP growth rate, adding even more worrying was the poor 
performance in sectors ranging from agriculture to construction, 
manufacturing and services.

CM, Pawar flayed for contradicting views on Enron
The Times of India News Service

07/03/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

PUNE: Criticising chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and NCP president Sharad 
Pawar for adopting extreme stands on the Enron imbroglio, former deputy chief 
minister and senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde has said his party did not have 
any objection to a thorough probe into the entire power supply deal. 
Addressing a press conference here, Munde said Deshmukh and Pawar had 
complicated the Enron issue by constantly airing their views despite the fact 
that the Godbole committee was in the middle of negotiations with the U.S. 
power major to reduce the tariff.
""While Deshmukh says that he will not tolerate the arm-twisting tactics of 
the power company, Pawar threatens to agitate if the project is scrapped. 
Such extreme stands will hamper the efforts of the Godbole committee while it 
holds deliberations with Dabhol Power Company,"" Munde said. 
To a question, Munde said he did not anticipate the NCP withdrawing support 
to the Congress-led coalition government in the state over the Enron issue. 
""Although Pawar did mention the possibility of his party pulling out from the 
government initially, he himself made statements to the contrary some days 
later,"" quipped Munde. 
Speaking on the furore created in the Pune Municipal Corporation due to the 
ruling party's proposal to remove the portrait of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh 
founder Hedgewar, he said the Congress was behaving in a vindictive manner. 
Given the fact that Hedgewar's portrait was put up after a resolution to this 
effect by the general body of the corporation, the Congress did not have the 
power to arbitrarily order its removal, he added. 
Munde refuted allegations that former minister and scion of the royal family, 
Udayan Raje Bhosale, indicted in the Sharad Leve murder case, was let off due 
to a weak case filed by the home ministry during his regime. ""The case and 
the charge-sheet against Bhosale were filed by the Democratic Front 
government when Chhagan Bhujbal was home minister,"" he clarified. 
Asked to comment on the arrest of all BJP corporators in the Nagpur Municipal 
Corporation in the infamous sports goods scam, Mr Munde said the Democratic 
Front government was misusing the Nand Lal committee report with a political 
agenda in mind. ""As many as 13 corporators not named in the report have also 
been arrested. The technical mistakes on the part of the corporators have 
been brought out as unfair practices,"" he said. 
Similar probes should then be conducted in civic bodies in Pune and 
Pimpri-Chinchwad also, where the Congress and NCP have the majority, he 
demanded.

NEW DELHI, July 3 Asia Pulse - Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) 
said on that Indian financial institutions were ready to take over the 
troubled US$3 million Dabhol Power Company (DPC) if its promoters Enron 
pulled out, but said FIs would not run the company. 
""In the worst circumstances (Enron pulling out), we can takeover the power 
project,"" IDBI S C Chakravarti told reporters here.
He, however, said the FIs would not run the company. An operations and 
maintenance contractor would be appointed to run the show. 
Enron has threatened to walk out of the 740 MW Phase-I, which is operational, 
and 1444 MW Phase-II to be commissioned shortly, project over payment 
disputes with Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 
Chakravarti said three US energy companies have expressed interest in taking 
over DPC, but refused to divulge further details. 
Indian financial institutions were due to meet in Delhi Monday evening to 
discuss the future course of action. 
Asked about the Central bailout package, involving sale of power from DPC to 
energy deficit states, Chakravarti said he was unaware of developments and 
would not be able to comment on it.

Three US electricity generation companies are in talks with Indian lenders 
for taking over the operations of Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Corporation, 
top financial institution executives said. 
Industrial Development Bank of India chairman S K Chakraborti said that these 
generation companies have approached Indian lenders who are keen on the 
completion of the project.
But, he declined to name the companies saying talks have just been initiated. 
The lenders, who earlier had a cover on assets, have also taken control of 
the DPC's equity which can be used as security. 
AES has already evinced interest in the project and is learnt to have 
initiated talks with the power ministry and IDBI, the lead institution for 
the DPC. 
""We are prepared to take over Enron's stake if it decides to pull out. We 
would not run the company but the operations and maintenance contractor would 
be appointed to run the show,"" he said 
Enron has threatened to walk out of the 740 mw phase-I, which is operational, 
and 1,444 mw phase-II to be commissioned shortly.

SMARTMONEY.COM: What Will the Second Half Bring?
By Rebecca Thomas

07/02/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of SMARTMONEY.COM 

AS THE DOORS closed on the second quarter, investors found themselves in 
nearly the same situation as in the first three months of the year. The U.S. 
economy is barely growing, and corporate profits remain in recession. Lower 
interest rates and tax rebates will inevitably bring relief sooner or later, 
but the emphasis is now on later.
Yet many of our pundits insist they see sunshine poking through the clouds. 
They'll be the first to acknowledge that the implosion in corporate profits 
has been painful, but they're quick to add that the equity market tends to 
lead the business cycle recovery by three to six months. Investors who get in 
now - though they're assuming substantial risk - stand to reap the greatest 
rewards if the economy recovers any time in the second half of this year, 
they promise. 
""If the U.S. is in recession now, and if the market turns up five months 
before the recession ends (which has been the average), then the stock market 
is OK if the recession ends by October,"" says ISI Group chief economist Ed 
Hyman, typically one of our most bearish pundits. Adds the generally upbeat 
Thomas Galvin, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston: 
""Once the [economic] data points change, which I think they're in the process 
of doing, everyone and their mother will be back in the market."" 
Of course, there's no denying that conditions worsened in the second quarter 
and remain inordinately weak. The deterioration in corporate profitability 
and capital spending, as well as slowing consumer spending and sluggish 
growth abroad, continue to make the threat of recession a real concern. As 
UBS Warburg's Ed Kerschner, our No. 2- ranked pundit, puts it: ""No doubt 
about it - it's nasty out there."" 
Our pundits have adjusted their profit estimates to reflect this reality. 
Kerschner now expects second-quarter S&P 500 operating earnings to fall at 
least 14.4% below year-ago levels. ""[T]his looks like the worst quarter of 
the profit cycle,"" he says. And the next two quarters might not be that much 
better, according to Ed Yardeni. On June 25, the chief investment strategist 
at Deutsche Banc. Alex Brown lowered his full-year S&P 500 profit estimate to 
$47 - reflecting a 14% year-over-year decline. Kerschner is the first Wall 
Street strategist to project earnings below $50 a share. Given the dreary 
near-term outlook, it's hard to blame investors for their wariness. Goldman 
Sachs guru Abby Joseph Cohen, for one, recognizes that investors who are 
often eager to pay up for potentially good news when the market is rising 
become reluctant to assume the same risk in periods of uncertainty. Galvin is 
equally understanding: ""Investors are not bankrupt, but sentiment is clearly 
broke,"" he says. ""Today the average money-market fund rarely yields 4%, yet 
most investors are happy to sit on cash."" Indeed, investors currently hold 
$2.1 trillion in money-market funds - the highest level ever as a percentage 
of the market value of the Wilshire 5000 - and savings-account deposits are 
up 14% from last year, Galvin says. But if our pundits sympathize with 
investors' blas, attitude about stocks, they're definitely out to change it. 
Those who wait too long to get back into the market stand to lose out on 
potential profits in the end, they explain. ""Many investors would prefer to 
wait until favorable price momentum returns to stocks,"" says Cohen in 
reiterating her belief that share prices and price-to-earnings multiples for 
many companies have already fallen to attractive levels relative to growth 
expectations. ""We would rather make an early call, allowing our investing 
clients an opportunity to structure portfolios accordingly."" 
Elaine Garzarelli, the chairwoman of Garzarelli Capital, agrees: ""Eventually 
there will come a point when analysts revise down their estimates too much 
and then must rush to revise up when the economy snaps back...Because of 
this, we believe this is a good time to invest before upward revisions 
begin."" 
Lehman Brothers' Jeffrey Applegate is of similar mind. In his opinion, the 
broad market is actually 15% undervalued at current levels, despite being up 
12% since its last trough on April 4. Historically, equity returns have 
averaged 17% in the 12 months from this level of undervaluation, he says. 
Because cyclical stocks - such as retailers, financials and technology - tend 
to perform best in the early stages of a market recovery, the strategist last 
week boosted the economic sensitivity of his U.S. equity portfolio. 
Specifically, he increased his position in Internet-infrastructure software 
maker BEA Systems (BEAS) and storage king EMC (EMC), bringing his overall 
technology weighting to 24%. In the consumer-cyclical sector, Applegate 
snatched up more shares of homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI), jewelry juggernaut 
Tiffany (TIF) and Viad (VVI), a provider of products and services in money 
orders and payment processing. And in the financial industry (which accounts 
for a whopping 29% of his portfolio), Applegate replaced leasing- and 
financial-services provider GATX (GMT) with the more interest-rate receptive 
consumer-finance firm Household International (HI). To pay for his purchases, 
Applegate sold off a few defensive names - including AES (AES), Enron (ENE), 
Calpine (CPN) and Dynegy (DYN) - in energy and utilities. Knowing which 
companies to avoid in this nasty environment is also part of the game, says 
Kerschner, who screened out 37 companies that have the ""dubious distinction"" 
of having failed to meet Wall Street consensus estimates at least three times 
over the past five quarters. These companies, explains the strategist, ""did 
not successfully play the time-honored game of assiduously guiding down 
analysts' estimates during the quarter and then triumphantly meeting or 
beating the final figure."" Among the tainted 37 are US Airways Group (U), 
Bank One (ONE), Computer Sciences (CSC), American Home Products (AHP), 
Charles Schwab (SCH), Halliburton (HAL), Harrah's Entertainment (HET), 
McDonald's (MCD), Novell (NOVL) and Newmont Mining (NEM). 
As the second quarter ushers in the third, it's important to remember that 
things could indeed still get worse before they get better. But take note: 
It's during times like these that the early bird catches the worm.

USA: Duke denies using plant to sway Calif. power prices.

07/02/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, July 2 (Reuters) - Duke Energy, one of California's big, 
independent power generators, laid out on Monday written records it said 
prove it did not shut its San Diego power plant last winter to jack up 
electricity prices. 
Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke said any fluctuations in generation last winter at 
its 700 megawatt, gas-fired South Bay plant were ordered by the California 
Independent System Operator (ISO), the agency that oversees operation of the 
state's power grid.
""Records from the ISO's Automatic Dispatch System demonstrate that Duke 
Energy Trading and Marketing received instructions from the ISO for 
increasing and decreasing the power output from the South Bay plant,"" the 
company said in a statement. 
California has petitioned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to 
order $9 billion in refunds from power companies it claims took advantage of 
the state's energy crisis to ""gouge"" the market, pushing wholesale prices up 
tenfold over the past year. 
Duke has repeatedly denied it tried to manipulate prices, citing plant 
maintenance, strict pollution rules, soaring natural gas prices and the 
financial risks linked to doing business with California's cash-strapped 
utilities as the main reasons behind the state's volatile spot power prices. 
Duke, together with Dynegy Inc. , Enron Corp. , Williams Cos Inc. , and 
Reliant Energy , is currently being investigated by state and federal 
officials to determine whether they manipulated the market by witholding 
power. 
Three former South Bay plant employees last month told a California senate 
hearing that Duke had instructed them to ramp down generation at the plant at 
times when the state's electricity reserves were extremely low. 
The three workers were hired by Sempra Energy's utility subsidiary San Diego 
Gas & Electric and remained at the plant after it was sold to Duke in 1998. 
They were eventually let go by Duke as part of the plant takeover. 
Earlier Monday, Duke said it was trimming $20 million from the bills it 
presented to the ISO and California Power Exchange for energy sales to the 
two this past January and February. 
The move implements a June 19 FERC order that Duke Energy ""offset any 
invoiced amounts above the proxy price set for electricity,"" which was set at 
$273 per megawatt hour for January and $430 for February.

State controller releases unedited power contracts
By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer

07/02/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - State Controller Kathleen Connell released unedited 
versions of $43 billion worth of long-term energy contracts with 27 power 
generators on Monday, including several short-term deals whose release the 
Davis administration warned could drive up prices. 
The 41 contracts released Monday were the subject of a court fight between 
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, Republican legislators and news organizations 
including The Associated Press.
For months, Davis had refused to release details of long-term contacts the 
state has signed with electricity providers, saying the documents needed to 
remain secret. The state began negotiating the contracts in January after the 
state's three private utilities were unable to secure credit to buy power. 
On June 15, Davis released 38 long-term contracts, but they had key portions 
blacked out. The news organizations then sued to have the complete contracts 
released. 
Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Davis, said the administration had agreed 
Friday to release the long-term contracts, but asked to have the release of 
the short-term contracts delayed for three months. 
The four short-term contracts Connell released Monday, which range from days 
to months, reveal more of the state's strategy for buying on the spot market, 
said Maviglio and Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo. 
Revealing that could lead to higher wholesale prices, Maviglio said. 
""It shows the irresponsibility of the controller and every California who 
gets a higher electricity bill can thank Kathleen Connell,"" Maviglio said. 
The newly released documents show which companies are selling power to the 
state, how much they are charging and where it is generated. 
Two of the short-term contracts included 30-day contacts with the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power that totaled $57.9 million. The municipal 
district provided a constant flow of 167 megawatts in March and 250 megawatts 
in April. One megawatt is roughly enough power for 750 homes. 
""We still feel that those will hinder our leverage in gaining reasonably 
priced power on the spot market,"" Hidalgo said. ""It shows our position on the 
daily spot market and what we're willing to pay."" 
Generators can use that information to time their sales and drive up their 
prices, Hidalgo said. 
Another short-term contract was with Houston-based Enron Power Marketing 
Inc., which sold a steady stream of 200 megawatts, 16 hours a day, six days a 
week in March and April. In its contract, Enron required the state to pay its 
bill once a week. 
""It is not unusual. The state had never been in this type of position. They 
wanted to be sure they got some sort of payment,"" Hidalgo said. ""You'll 
notice, though, that we haven't dealt with Enron since. There's no deals 
pending, and they're a very big player."" 
Connell said her initial analysis of the contracts she released was that the 
average price per megawatt was higher than the governor's estimate of $70. 
But Maviglio said the administration's math was correct. 
""Given the controller's track record in assessing the work we've done this 
far, I wouldn't give much weight to her guesswork,"" he said. ""The governor 
and the treasurer have consistently proven her wrong on every one of her 
claims."" 
Mike Wilczek, senior western power market reporter for Platts, the energy 
market information division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, said much of the 
information in the contracts would be more valuable to the companies' 
competitors than to the public. 
""It's very clear why you'd want to keep that stuff secret,"" he said. 
Competitors will be particularly interested in delivery points, the power 
plants that will supply electricity to a particular delivery point, and the 
heat rates. 
Heat rates, for instance, ""tells them how efficient the plant is,"" Wilczek 
said. ""You can look at this stuff and say, 'That's as low as they can go""' in 
pricing their electricity at that plant. 
""That's probably the most sensitive information,"" he said. 
Knowing which plant supplies which delivery point could affect prices for 
that particular generator. For instance, if a competitor knows a particular 
plant is down, and the supplier is contractually responsible for sending 
power to that distribution point, ""they're going to take advantage of that,"" 
he said. 
Connell said the judge heard all the evidence before ordering the complete 
contracts released and ""there is no reason that information should raise 
prices. Today's prices aren't going to be affected by prices engineered 
several months ago."" 
Public Utilities Commissioner Richard Bills said the terms of the contracts, 
most of which are 10 years, are too long. 
By signing long-term contracts in a volatile market like this, Bills said, 
""the result could well be that we get burned because we've entered in too 
long an agreement at prices that will be well above market as these contracts 
mature."" 
In addition to the energy contracts, Connell also released documents showing 
the state has paid $402.6 million toward the contract totals. 
The state also paid various energy consultants $2.8 million. Those contracts 
include payments to several industry officials who have been negotiating the 
state's long-term power contracts, such as S. David Freeman, the governor's 
chief energy adviser.

ANCHORS: ALEX CHADWICK

REPORTERS: ELAINE KORRY

BODY:

??ALEX CHADWICK, host:

??California's rushing to get new power plants up and running. ?In January,
Governor Gray Davis used emergency powers to speed the permit process. There 
has
been progress, but NPR's Elaine Korry reports probably not enough to avoid 
more
blackouts this summer.

??ELAINE KORRY reporting:

??Since January, California energy regulators have been slashing red tape to
speed new power plants online. ?Their tracking 180 separate projects. Bob
Thurkelsen, who overseas permitting at the California Energy Commission, says
the governor's emergency directive has already paid off.

??Mr. BOB THURKELSEN (California Energy Commission): And that has allowed us
to, so far, permit 450 megawatts of new generation in a 21-day period.

??KORRY: In a few cases, even quicker than that. ?Jim Michael is the president
of Alliance Power, based in Denver, which sprinted through its permit process 
in
under three weeks.

??Mr. JIM MICHAEL (Alliance Power): Well, we're pouring concrete. We're on
schedule, so we're gonna have power plants operating this summer.

??KORRY: Alliance is building two small generators in Southern California.
Michael says permitting projects that used to take months were, instead,
completed in a day or two, allowing the company to meet critical deadlines.

??Mr. MICHAEL: It was essential. ?Without that streamlining, these projects
would have gone away. ?The turbines would have been sold to other projects
outside of California and so we would have essentially failed.

??KORRY: Yet there's still a major hitch. ?Despite the speedup in permitting,
California will still fall far short of the governor's initial goal. ?He 
wanted
5,000 new megawatts of electricity, enough to power five million homes, to 
come
online by July 1st. ?In a worst-case scenario, that's how much additional 
supply
the state would need to keep the lights on this summer. ?Yet only half that
amount, 2,500 megawatts, will be up and running by July. ?Jan Smutny-Jones 
heads
the industry lobbying group the Independent Energy Producers Association. 
?He's
not surprised by the shortfall.

??Mr. JAN SMUTNY-JONES (Independent Energy Producers Association): We said at
the time that was a very ambitious goal. And we'll see how it plays out.

??KORRY: Smutny-Jones says blackouts are a near certainty this summer. Their
severity will depend on a number of unknowns. ?How hot will it get this 
summer?
How much more can Californian's skimp on electricity? ?And how much wattage 
will
the power wholesalers themselves take off line? Power producers have been
charged with deliberately shutting down plants to keep prices high. 
Smutny-Jones
has a different explanation for the down time.

??Mr. SMUTNY-JONES: California's electric power system is rapidly aging. We
have not built a power plant of an appreciable amount in over a decade. ?And
there--while there's power plants being built now, the average age of these
power plants is in excess of 36 years old. ?That's the average age, which 
means
that a significant amount of the fleet is older than that. ?They break down.

??KORRY: The industry, itself, is partly to blame for the aging fleet. The
Energy Commission did license small generators during the 1990s. And if bigger
ones weren't built, it's largely because the energy producers, themselves,
balked at building them. ?Chris Seiple, with RDI Consulting, says construction
slowed everywhere; that is, until last year. ?Since 2000, he says, 90,000 new
megawatts of energy have come online nationwide. ?That's more capacity in two
years than was built during all of the 1990s. ?And now comes the Bush national
energy policy, urging even greater production. ?According to Seiple, we could
wind up with too much of a good thing.

??Mr. CHRIS SEIPLE (RDI Consulting): So we really expect that in--What?--50
markets we will go from a situation of having shortages to having too much
supply.

??KORRY: In yesterday's speech, President Bush repeated the
administration's claim that the nation will need at least 1,300 additional 
power
plants over the next two decades. ?Seiple says an over supply would drive down
prices, hurting the power wholesalers, but lower energy costs would suit most
ratepayers just fine. Elaine Korry, NPR News, San Francisco.

??CHADWICK: It's 19 minutes past the hour.

BYLINE: DAVID KRAVETS


DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

???California's largest utility has sued the state seeking reimbursement of
millions of dollars in energy contracts seized by the governor.

??San Francisco-based Pacific Gas & Electric Co. ''has received no 
compensation
for the damage to its property,'' the company said in a lawsuit filed Tuesday 
in
San Francisco Superior Court.

??PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection in April and is struggling to repay
$14.4 billion to thousands of creditors.

??Gov. Gray Davis seized the energy contracts on Jan. 31 to keep the 
California
Power Exchange from liquidating them. The now-defunct exchange, which had been
the state's middleman for buying and selling power, wanted the contracts to
recoup hundreds of millions of dollars that PG&E owed it.

??The governor's office acknowledged that California owes PG&E for the
contracts, an amount that Davis wants a judge to determine. At the time they
were seized, the state estimated their value at $160 million, while the power
exchange priced them at $347 million.

??''We seized the contracts to have reasonable priced power and expected that
price to be set in a neutral forum,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's
spokesman.

??Under the contracts, the state buys electricity at a set price rather than
paying higher prices for power bought at the last minute. Therefore, the
contracts' value changes with the volatile price of electricity.

??''We believe the state has benefited from the value of our contracts, and as
a result we should be compensated,'' PG&E spokesman Ron Low said.

??Low declined to place a value on the contracts.

HEADLINE: Consumers cashing in instead of cooling off

BYLINE: By Katie Oyan

BODY:

??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ Whether it's the call of duty or the cash incentive,
the first wave of power bills reflecting a state rebate program show a large
number of Californians are lining up to ease the grid.

??Savings from Pacific Gas & Electric's 20/20 rebate program total $7.6 
million
so far, a spokesman said.

??The program, an initiative by Gov. Gray Davis to promote conservation, 
shaves
20 percent off customers' bills for using 20 percent less energy this summer
than last summer.

??PG&E has processed one-third of its July power bills, and the results show
that 29 percent of customers sliced enough electricity use last month to earn
the reward.

??Out of about 1.3 million bills processed, 394,000 customers qualified for 
the
credits.

??Thousands more still stand to gain as the company sifts through remaining
bills. PG&E serves 4.7 million customers in Northern California, from Baker to
the Oregon border.

??""Twenty-nine percent are meeting the qualifications, which is good,"" said
PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne. ""That's a significant chunk.""

??The results also are significant compared to previous expectations. Davis
administration officials estimated that 10 percent to 20 percent of customers
would earn the rebate.

??Of those who qualified, 355,000 were residential customers and 39,000 fell
under commercial, industrial or agriculture categories.

??The savings were divided roughly in half. Residents saved $3.7 million;
businesses, factories, farms and ranches saved $3.9 million.

??The average residential customer who qualified for the discount sheared $
10.50 off energy costs. Commercial, industrial and agricultural customers _
whose bills can reach $200,000 a month _ saved an average of $100.

??""In general, these are all very positive results,"" Tremayne said. ""It shows
that Californians as a whole, individually and collectively, do our part.""

??Davis ordered investor-owned utilities _ PG&E, Southern California Edison 
and
San Diego Gas & Electric Co. _ to take part in rebate programs in March.

??The campaign was designed to stave off rolling blackouts and spare the state
from having to import loads of expensive electricity on behalf of its
financially distressed utilities.

??The programs benefit California's biggest energy guzzlers the most. Those 
who
used very little electricity to begin with have little room to cut back.

??Merle Luck, a senior citizen who lives in a one-bedroom apartment in 
Concord,
said the 20/20 reward is likely out of her grasp.

??""My bill isn't that high, so I don't come up to the baseline,"" she said.

??If Luck uses any less electricity than she already does, she'll roast.

??""I'm more careful and I think twice, but my big thing is the air
conditioner,"" she said. ""I'm not keeping it quite as cool as I would like, 
but I
have lots of windows and lots of sun, and it can get very warm.""

??Even with her conservation efforts, Luck's $28 power bill wasn't as steep as
she expected.

??""It's a little more than last year at this time, but I think we've had more
heat,"" she said.

BODY:

??PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. utility sued California on Tuesday,
saying it wants to be paid for the wholesale electricity contracts the state
seized in January.

??Gov. Gray Davis took away Pacific Gas' 12-month forward contracts to ensure 
a
sufficient and continuous supply of electricity for the state. ?At the time,
California estimated the contracts were worth $150 million.

??Pacific Gas claims the contracts had ""significant value"" because they 
allowed
the utility to receive power for less than current market rates.

??""Although PG&E has demanded just compensation from the [state], PG&E has
received no compensation for the damage to its property,"" the utility said in
court papers filed Monday in San Francisco Superior Court.

??The company, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in April, is seeking
damages and attorney fees. The state claimed in January that the contracts 
would
have delivered enough electricity to power 100,000 to 500,000 homes for 6 
cents
to 13 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Trading, Wholesale Power Boost Duke's Earnings 27%

BYLINE: THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

??Pushed by the explosive growth of its trading and wholesale-power 
businesses,
Duke Energy Corp. on Tuesday reported a 27% increase in second-quarter profit,
narrowly topping Wall Street estimates.

??Duke's net income was $419 million, or 53 cents per share, in the quarter
ended June 30, up from $329 million, or 44 cents, in the year-ago quarter. The
consensus estimate of industry analysts was 52 cents per share.

??Revenue for the quarter leaped 43% to $15.6 billion.

??Shares rose 38 cents to close at $42.03 on the New York Stock Exchange.

??Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke, like other out-of-state independent power
producers, is under fire from Gov. Gray Davis for allegedly overcharging for
electricity from its California generating plants.

??Duke does not break out its California results, but its profits from soaring
spot-market prices in California during the quarter probably amounted to no 
more
than a penny or two per share, according to analyst Jeff Gildersleeves of 
Argus
Research in New York.

??California accounts for about 10% of Duke's U.S. wholesale-power business,
and about 90% of its California power is sold through long-term contracts 
rather
than on the spot market, the company has said.

??Those long-term contracts are a source of worry for investors, Gildersleeves
said. Neither Duke nor the state has disclosed whether the contract prices can
be adjusted downward if spot-market prices fall, he said. If the prices are 
not
firm, it could represent a risk to future profits, he added, especially if 
spot
prices continue to fall.

??Duke's North American Wholesale Energy business unit posted second-quarter
operating earnings of $251 million, up 128% from $110 million a year earlier.

??Analyst Timothy M. Winter of A.G. Edwards in St. Louis said the overall
quarter was ""very good,"" considering that Duke's earnings from its regulated-
utility business in North and South Carolina actually were flat because of 
mild
weather, a slowing economy and increased costs associated with some nuclear
generating facilities being out of operation.

HEADLINE: Gov. Davis trying to turn energy crisis to political advantage

BYLINE: By John Howard

BODY:

??SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ An enduring image of the spring-summer of 2001: Calif.
Gov. Gray Davis perched in front of a power plant, speaking over the turbines'
din about California's energy crisis.

??The Democratic governor doesn't address the knot of sweaty local reporters
busily taking notes. He gazes past them to the television cameras, which 
capture
his image and send it across the nation. He may be speaking in Yuba City or
Sacramento or Bakersfield, but he's talking to Washington, D.C., New York and
Chicago.

??For Davis is trying to turn California's energy crisis to his political
advantage. Despite some setbacks - such as a federal regulatory judge's 
finding
last week that California is eligible for much less in energy refunds than 
Davis
wants _ he has a growing national presence, where just weeks ago he had almost
none.

??Davis remains the Democrats' point man on energy and the environment. Those
are two issues Democrats hope to use to win back the White House.

??""He's the leading governor among Democrats, and certainly the dominant
governor in a Democratic field for president,"" said Republican consultant Tony
Quinn. ""But he has to get credit for getting the energy crisis solved. There 
has
to be sufficient supply next year, no blackouts next summer and the prices 
have
to stabilize.""

??Davis has started to dance on the national stage, where presidential 
hopefuls
audition. And if he wins re-election next year _ not a certainty _ that stage
will be his new home.

??Thus, Davis, the career politician, has come to the defining moment of his
political career.

??""If he turns this around and gets re-elected handily, he's a contender,"" 
said
Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.

??Sabato cautioned: ""But he's in trouble in his own state. He didn't 
anticipate
the crisis, but he's been in office for two years, so it's difficult for him 
to
say, 'None of this happened on my watch.' That's a tough argument to make.""

??Davis, of course, has been busy making precisely that argument every chance
he gets. The rest of his message: California, given short shrift by federal
regulators, has been bilked of billions of dollars by profit-hungry energy
companies.

??That message has been honed by Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane, two political
consultants who are largely responsible for Davis' emerging national presence.
Davis hired them under a state-paid $30,000 contract that prompted outrage 
from
Republicans and at least one lawsuit. Fabiani recently left the state payroll.

??Both White House veterans, Fabiani and Lehane are known as the ""Masters of
Disaster"" for their handling of Clinton-Gore scandals, including Whitewater 
and
Asian fund-raising.

??In just seven weeks, the two strategists started turning Davis' political
fortunes around.

??""In March and April, I used to see these emails from Republicans doing high
fives and saying he (Davis) was toast. I don't see that now,"" said Mark
Bogetich, a Republican researcher.

??Davis also is using campaign funds to finance $150,000 a week worth of radio
ads to get his message to voters. The campaign follows Republican-backed
television ads targeting the governor.

??True, the Masters of Disaster have been lucky in polishing Davis' image _
there have been miscues by Bush, good weather and a dearth of blackouts. But
Fabiani and Lehane made their own luck, too.

??They went on the offensive, in the manner of an election campaign:

??They set up daily, campaign-style events, complete with ""visuals"" for
television and daily news nuggets for print media.

??They created the governor's ""Daily Energy Agenda"" and ""News From Gray 
Davis,""
spin fixtures they faxed and emailed around the state.

??They began holding regular press conference calls with Davis administration
officials, daily and through the weekend, getting the administration's spin to
the public.

??They ratcheted up Davis' rhetoric demonizing power generators as
price-gougers and pirates, focused on Bush and his regulators as the power
behind California's crisis, and depicted the state as the helpless victim of
powerful forces.

??""They turned his numbers around, temporarily,"" said Sacramento-based
Republican consultant Mike Donovan. ""But he's clearly not out of the woods 
yet.""

??Bush's recent visit to California to attend an ""energy summit"" gave the
governor more ammunition. Davis, coached by Fabiani and Lehane, scored when
Bush, as expected, turned down the governor's request to meet with the public 
to
discuss the electricity crisis. The confrontation made front pages across the
country. In Lehane's view, it showed a responsible governor bashed by an
uncaring president.

??""In that sense, it was a major defining moment for both men,"" Lehane said.

??Nationally, Democrats have seized on environment and energy as two related
issues that will help give them back control of the House in 2002. They see
Davis as the key, and it is no secret in Washington that the White House views
Davis as a political threat.

??National media interest in Davis is growing and California television
reporters who cover the governor say their networks seek increasing coverage 
of
the governor.

??Since the spring, he has started to show up with greater regularity on
national television news shows, has become the national Democrats' point man 
to
attack the Bush administration's electricity policies, has been on CNN's 
""Larry
King Live"" and ""Inside Politics,"" and has done numerous talk shows. He's 
visited
the network morning programs. He's even been a mystery guest on ""The Tonight
Show With Jay Leno"" _ an appearance engineered in part by Lehane. He's 
testified
before a U.S. Senate newly dominated by friendly Democrats and made front 
pages
across the country.

??Looking to score points with national Democrats, Davis details his
differences with Bush on critical environmental issues. Those include Bush's
rejection of California's request for an exemption from a federal 
fuel-additive
requirement, the Bush administration's call for increased oil drilling in 
Alaska
and the president's dismantling of wilderness protections ordered by former
President Clinton.

??""He's more highly visible on the national level now, but if he stumbles, 
that
will be more visible, too,"" said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of
Claremont Graduate University.

??Democratic pollster Paul Maslin agrees.

??""All this is moot until (California) voters render a judgment next November
(2002). Whatever is going on nationally is far secondary to him doing his job
and whatever the verdict of the voters is,"" Maslin said.

??Meanwhile, Bush might be helping Davis build a national profile. A recent 
New
York Times-CBS News survey showed Bush's personal appeal has dropped to its
lowest point since April 2000. Most people are disenchanted with a number of
Bush's policies, including energy and the environment, which Davis is 
targeting.

??""Ironically, he and Bush are basically joined at the hip on this energy
issue,"" Jeffe said. ""He (Davis) is being blamed for it in California, and Bush
is being blamed for it nationally. So one could make the case that the 
political
fortunes of Gray Davis and George Bush are inextricably intertwined.""

HEADLINE: Lawmakers devise rival bailout plans for Edison;

Push to come up with alternative to bankruptcy before recess

SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Lawmakers are struggling this week to agree on a plan to keep Southern
California Edison from declaring bankruptcy as they rush to complete business
before Friday's scheduled summer recess.

???After months of talking about a solution and dismissing one agreed to by
Edison and Gov. Gray Davis, lawmakers now have several competing proposals to
consider.

???A plan introduced last week by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman
Oaks (Los Angeles County), was debated for several hours yesterday, along 
with a
GOP-backed alternative by Assemblyman Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles.

???The two plans, which are scheduled for votes today in the Assembly Energy
Costs and Availability Committee, take sharply different approaches:

???-- Hertzberg's plan would pay $2.4 billion for Edison's transmission lines
to help cover the utility's estimated $3.5 billion debt. The utility would be
allowed to pay off its remaining debt by issuing bonds.

???The utility would repay the bonds using ratepayer money. For the first two
years, all customers would pay for the debt, but after that the largest users
would pay off the rest.

???-- Wright calls his plan a ""straight bailout."" It would allow the utility 
to
issue bonds to cover all of its debt and impose a $2 a month rate increase for
all users until the debt is paid.

???The Senate also introduced its own plan. A bill by Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo
Alto, would give the state a five-year option to buy the transmission lines 
and
would have the state back only $2.5 billion of the utility's debt.

???Since Davis announced a deal with Edison earlier this year, lawmakers,
business groups and consumer advocates have all expressed reservations with 
one
aspect or another of it. Opposition has usually focused on the state purchase 
of
Edison's transmission lines.

???The flurry of activity this week is an effort by lawmakers to take some 
kind
of vote before they adjourn. The Edison agreement has an Aug. 15 deadline for
approval by the Legislature.

???Brian Bennett, a spokesman for Edison, said creditors view that date as
extremely important.

???""We're as close to bankruptcy as our creditors want us to be,"" he said. ""Is
it a drop dead date? I don't know, but it is clearly an important date.""

???Consumer groups have denounced Wright's plan, and at least one calls
Hertzberg's proposal just another bailout and said it would cost Californians 
$
6.7 billion over the next 10 years.

???""We cannot be seduced by big businesses paying a bailout tax,"" said Doug
Heller, a consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights. ""At the end of the day, we know businesses will pass these costs on to
the consumer.""

???Included in the 76-page Hertzberg bill are provisions that would allow 
large
companies to buy their power directly from a provider instead of going through
the utility after 2003.

???But a coalition of large business groups also said they are strongly 
opposed
to the plan because it does not allow for immediate direct access.

???""Ultimately, we think our companies buying power for themselves is the best
solution,"" said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and
Technology Association. ""If businesses think there's a light at the end of the
tunnel where they see lower rates coming, they might tough it out and stay.""

???Wright argues that the beauty of his proposal is that it could easily apply
to the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. service area if the company wanted to use 
it
as a way out of bankruptcy court. He estimates that PG&E customers would pay
about $4 a month to help the company pay off its debt.

???""This is a straight bailout,"" Wright said. ""This is not a hidden bill. 
There
are extras.""

???Wright said he believes his constituents would rather pay an extra $2 than
be unemployed because their business left the state due to high energy costs.

???Business groups said the idea makes sense.

???""What good would it do to have your electricity bill reduced by $10 or $15
but not have a job?"" said Bill Hauck, president of the California Business
Roundtable.

???Whatever plan is eventually authorized would be used to convince the PG&E
bankruptcy judge to follow a similar model for that company, giving the state
those transmission lines as well.

???The purchase of the transmission lines has been at the center of Davis'
plan. He argues that the purchase will give the state the ability to upgrade 
the
system, allowing a better flow of power between Northern and Southern 
California
and a decreased chance of blackouts.

???But opponents argue that the state is getting one-third of a complicated
system that will cost billions to upgrade and operate.

???""It's like buying a car with three wheels -- it is not going to get out of
the lot,"" consumer advocate Heller said.E-mail Lynda Gledhill at

Pursuant to your request for a term sheet that would propose legislation to 
enable broadband access for every home and business in an attempt to bridge 
the digital divide, please see the attached document below.  The term sheet 
incorporates several federal solutions to funding a fiber or DSL build-out 
that will support high speed connectivity for residential and business 
premises, including a ""take-back"" of HDTV spectrum and subsequent auction 
thereof, as well as the establishment of individual tax credits or a 
""Broadband Buildout and Internet Access Trust Fund.""

While the term sheet describes different opportunities for the government to 
endorse the build-out of last mile infrastructure, the federal solutions set 
forth do not have a high probability of enactment by the next congress.  
Thus, we are identifying additional means of promoting broadband access

describes additional avenues.  Perhaps we could meet at that time to discuss

Governor's greased lighting 
Davis criticized for accepting money from power companies
 
Sacramento -- After having sworn off campaign contributions from energy companies, Gov. Gray Davis has started taking money from power providers seeking to do business with the state. 

The two $25,000 contributions came during a series of fund-raisers the governor held when he made a trip last month to the East Coast to view the damage at the World Trade Center and Pentagon. 

The Democratic governor, who has raised more than $30 million for his re- election campaign, has been criticized for taking money from groups that have interests before the administration. 

Yesterday, Davis defended the decision to take the money, saying the worst of the energy crisis is behind us. 

""My concern was in not taking money from people who were actively selling us power during the difficult early months in 2001,"" he said of his decision in January to stop taking contributions from utilities and power companies. ""To my knowledge neither of those companies are active players in that process. "" 

But consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield blasted Davis for accepting the money and said it should be returned. 

""If it was dirty money before, it is even dirtier now,"" said Rosenfield, who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. Davis is mistaken to think that the energy crisis is over, Rosenfield said. 

""Tell that to the 20 million Californians who have seen their rates increase an average of 50 percent,"" he said. 

The two companies -- FPL Energy LLC and Caithness Energy LLC -- each gave $25,000 to Davis' campaign fund. 

Both contributors have proposed projects pending in California. 

Caithness Energy, a New York-based generator, is expected to file plans to build a power plant with the California Energy Commission later this month. The company wants to build a 560-megawatt natural gas fired plant in Riverside County. 

And subsidiaries of FPL Energy, a Florida generator that operates power plants across the country, are in negotiations with the state's new Power Authority to construct wind turbines in Southern California. The state would buy energy from the turbines and have the option to own them. 

In addition, Caithness and FPL are working together to building another power plant in Riverside County. That project was approved by the state's Energy Commission in March. 

Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said the campaign's position had not changed with regard to collecting money from energy interests. 

South said that the two companies had not been gouging the state and that the fact they had business pending with the state was irrelevant. 

""It is not against the law to take money from a company that does business with the state,"" he said. South said the contributions had no bearing on any decisions made. 

 
 
India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week
 
NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Prospective buyers of the 85% foreign equity in India's 2,184-megawatt Dabhol Power Co. will start due diligence of the project next week, A.K. Doda, executive director of Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), told Dow Jones Newswires Friday. 

The possible buyers are Tata Power Co. Ltd. (P.TPW) and BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) 

""After the due diligence is completed, price negotiations will start and thereafter, the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place,"" Doda said. 

U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) has a controlling 65% equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant's sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. In August the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost. 

Dabhol is India's largest single foreign investment to date. MSEB has 15%, while U.S.-based companies General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each in DPC. 

""The share price of the shareholding of Enron and its associates in DPC would be decided by the concerned parties, through mutual negotiations. Indian financial institutions propose to continue their efforts to ensure quick resolution of all issues at the earliest,"" Doda said. 

Doda denied local media reports saying that India's state-owned firm National Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) was also a potential buyer of the foreign equity in Dabhol. 

""So far, I am aware of only two companies - Tata Power and BSES. NTPC haven't sent us any expression of interest yet for the Dabhol project,"" he said. 


Ontario mulls alternative to Hydro deregulation
 
The planned deregulation of the $35-billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the province's electricity transmission company, preventing it from becoming a significant player in an open North American power market. 

The plan, known only to Ontario Premier Mike Harris and a few government and Bay Street insiders, would turn Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity instead of a fully commercial, privatized company. If this happens, Hydro One would lack the flexibility to raise equity capital, make acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continent's premier transmission companies -- a goal plainly set out by chief executive officer Eleanor Clitheroe. 

David Lindsay, the president and chief executive officer of Ontario SuperBuild Corp., the government's privatization adviser, confirmed that turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization, similar to Nav Canada, the civil air navigation service, is under serious consideration. 

""We've been asked to evaluate all options for Hydro One's future, including this one,"" he said yesterday. 

He would not provide details, though it is thought that the government wants to make a decision on Hydro One's future ownership structure by the conclusion of the year. 

A senior official in the Ontario government, who did not want to be identified, said the proposal ""is a step backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro."" He was referring to the debt-laden utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation, the electricity generating arm, and Hydro One, whose network of high-voltage transmission lines spans 30,000 kilometres. 

The Premier's office would not comment. A spokeswoman for Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that ""there are a number of options on the table."" 

Sources on Bay Street and at Queen's Park said the idea of turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell, the chairman of Royal Bank-owned RBC Dominion Securities, Bay Street's largest dealer. If the new Hydro One took this shape, it would raise about $10-billion through the sale of bonds to investors. 

The dealers' commission on the sale of the bonds, which would rank among the biggest debt issues in history, would range from $25-million to $40-million, one Bay Street executive said. 

Mr. Harris is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to the government to help pay down the $21-billion in ""stranded debt"" racked up by the old Ontario Hydro. The generating and transmission giant's decades-long spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the province's balance sheet. 

Hydro One's cash flow, derived from sales to electricity users, would be used to pay the interest on the $10-billion of bonds. Presumably, consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One lacked sufficient cash to pay the interest. If Hydro One were a private company instead, its financial risk would be borne by shareholders, not ratepayers. The United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts the financial risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders. 

Executives at RBC Dominion declined to comment on the plan, citing client confidentiality concerns. Mr. Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring. 

The government wants to open up the Ontario electricity market, in which buyers and sellers can negotiate prices, by next spring. The market overhaul contemplated turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, both of which are 100 per cent owned by the government, into commercial companies. In Hydro One's case, the leading options were thought to be an outright sale, in which the utility would be bought by another company (presumably a rival utility), or an initial public offering, where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the stock exchange. 

The third option -- converting Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization -- has come as a surprise. There has been no debate on this option, though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One, both of which were working on the assumption that the transmission business would eventually become a commercial enterprise. 

Sources said that Hydro One management opposes the not-for-profit structure because it would deny Hydro One the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business. The not-for-profit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes, which raises potential trade issues with the United States. American transmission companies might argue that Hydro One's non-taxable status gives it an unfair competitive advantage. 

It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially lucrative share options. 

Rod Taylor, Hydro One's executive vice-president, would not comment on the not-for-profit option being contemplated by the government. He said, however, that the company's strategy hinges on its ability to become a major player in the deregulated North American electricity market. ""Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity, and become in the transmission sector what Canadian National is to the rail sector,"" he said in a phone interview. 

Stanley Hartt, the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall Street's Salomon Smith Barney, is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a not-for-profit structure for Hydro One (Salomon has a small role as an adviser to Hydro One's strategic business plan). 

In a three-page letter sent this week to the top executives of several large power-using Ontario companies, he said that ""this idea is short-sighted and bad for Ontario."" 

He argued that ""the absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the not-for-profit corporation essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers."" He also said that, without financial flexibility, Hydro One would lack the resources to invest in ""new bottleneck-eliminating connections"" that would allow the company to become a significant electricity exporter. ""Ontario would lose the prospect of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmission,"" he said. 

In a recent report on the power industry, TD Newcrest analyst David McCracken wrote, ""With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet, Hydro One is well positioned to act as a consolidator of transmission grids in the northern United States, where ownership tends to be fragmented."" 

He noted that Hydro One is expected to be privatized in the next few years, and he said the utility has ""the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into competitive high-growth initiatives."" 

According to sources familiar with the not-for-profit proposal, Hydro One would be governed in the best interests of all electricity users by stocking the board of directors with appointees from corporations that are heavy power users, such as auto and steel makers and paper companies. Such a structure exists at Nav Canada, with airline executives on the board, and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers. 

Restructuring Hydro One with debt, rather than equity, is also presented as the most efficient way to capitalize the company. 

""The problem with a Canadian National Rail-style IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt,"" said one financier familiar with the proposal. ""With a debt-based structure, every dollar earned is available to pay interest, while an equity-based structure means you pay federal taxes, provide a return to shareholders and make debt payments."" 

Dofasco Inc., the big Ontario steel producer that consumes about $100-million of electricity a year, supports the not-for-profit proposal. Gord Forstner, head of communications, said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydro's stranded debt by $10-billion immediately, paving the way for lower electricity charges. Currently, a special levy on all electricity bills is being used to whittle down the debt. The charge costs Dofasco alone about $15-million a year. 

""We want to see the stranded debt paid down first,"" Mr. Forstner said. ""Until that happens, we don't favour Hydro One going to the expense of expanding outside of Ontario's boundaries."" Hydro One at a glance

First pegged exchange rates are the same as fixed exchange rate.  A
currency board goes further by promising by law that you will not change
the fixed rate (ie devalue).

In reality, r = r* does not hold perfectly.  It is a simplification
which we use to explain why under a fixed exchange rate system monetary
policy is inneffective...that there would be infinite capital flows to
the country with a higher interest rate.  I would read through Mankiw p
315 to 318 for a discussion on the risk premium which addresses your
question.

Now, the situations you refer to where a country chooses between
devaluation or raising interest rates occurs because a country is
drawing down its foreign reserves and despite the fat that r = r*, money
is flowing out. You can think of this as the introduction of a risk
premium, theta.  So that r = r* + theta. So r must now be raised in
order to preserve the capital flow equilibrium.

Without foreign reserves the central bank cannot honor the fixed
exchange rate.  Its choices then are either to raise the interest rates
sharply to preserve the currency or to devalue thereby raising net
exports and making it more expensive for foreigners to sell the domestic
currency (ie pesos) for dollars.  In the Mexico example in Mankiw, the
country did not raise rates and was eventually forced to devalue.

Often the idea is that a country should take the step to devalue before
it is in a crisis situation if it is not willing to cause a recession to
keep the exchange rate fixed.  This is what the IMF advised the Asian
countries months before the crisis.  They did not want to because of
credibility issues and fears that devaluing itself might precipitate a
crisis and raise the risk premium.  The problem is that if you wait too
long it becomes a fate accompli.

A currency is advocated by some because it replaces the central bank
with ""a cash register"" and solves the credibility issue.  The main
drawback is that you may have to cause a recession to honor your
exchange rate.",peggin,,Mankiw theta

I added some stuff, including the equations, to Dennis's PS#5 to make it
look like the Professor's (page 11 of the Project Management handout). I
printed out the equations using the control-tilda, too.

I also spent some time with Problem 1 from the team handout. I made at
least one important change - only using one bearing size that is then
calculated with shaft sizes for both current and proposed. I had a lot
of trouble with the precision on the graphs (only 2 digits after the
decimal), so I made pass/fail criteria (i.e. IF .005<bearing size-shaft
size<.009, returns a 1=pass, else 0=fail). I made these into report
cells too. I also made another report cell that compares the success of
the two methods - this is getting at question 3. It basically determines
if there is ever a time that the current method gets success when the
proposed method gets failure (I came up with 8.7% on 1000 runs).

Let me know what you think. See you tonight.

By Jason Leopold and Jessica Berthold 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Some power suppliers said Monday they wouldn't 
accept a move by California state lawmakers to allow them to collect just 70% 
of what they are owed by Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern 
California Edison. 

At issue are bills scheduled for hearings Monday and Tuesday in the state 
Assembly and Senate to rescue Southern California Edison from the verge of 
bankruptcy, where it has teetered for six months. 

Both bills aim to spread out the costs of helping the utility recover $3.5 
billion in wholesale power costs that it was forced to absorb as a result of 
a retail rate freeze. Discounts to unpaid power bills may be needed to make 
the rescue politically palatable. But some suppliers, which together are owed 
about $1 billion by the utility, are balking. 

""As we have said before, we fully expect to receive 100 cents on the dollar,"" 
said John Sousa, spokesman for Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs), which is owed 
$265 million in California. (Generators' receivables due from Southern 
California Edison alone weren't immediately available.) 

Reliant Energy Inc. (REI, news, msgs), owed a total of $370 million, said it 
too expects to receive full payment. 

Williams Cos. (WMB, news, msgs), which hasn't disclosed its California 
receivables, and Duke Energy (DUK, news, msgs), which is owed $410 million, 
have said publicly that their companies would be willing to accept less than 
100 cents on the dollar. But Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his company 
would only negotiate with the utilities, not the state. 

Pat Dorinson, spokesman for Mirant Corp. (MIR, news, msgs), which is owed 
$385 million in California, wouldn't say whether the company would accept 
less than what its owed. But he said the company wasn't included in the 
negotiations when the bill was drafted. 

""We can't have a comprehensive solution if all parties are not at the table,"" 
Dorinson said. ""No one has come to us and talked to us about what we are 
willing to do or not do. You'd think the people producing the energy might 
have on opinion on how things should be solved."" 

Suppliers said they weren't sure what action, if any, they'd take against the 
utilities if such provisions were approved as part of a deal this week. 

The Assembly and Senate proposals were expected to be debated on Monday and 
Tuesday, with floor votes on Wednesday. 

Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, said a rescue plan for 
Southern California Edison could never pass the Legislature without 
concessions from generators. 

The proposals in both houses call for generators to accept 70 cents on the 
dollar. In the Assembly, legislation introduced last week by Assembly Speaker 
Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Keeley, aims to establish a trust account, 
controlled by the state and the Public Utilities Commission, to reduce 
payments to generators who overcharged for power. 

""Our proposal protects those who deregulation has hurt most - consumers - and 
ensures that California never sees a crisis like this again,"" Hertzberg said. 
""It holds accountable those who have taken advantage of us and it promises 
consumers that they will see rates go down rather than up."" 

Such a move may violate Constitutional protections regarding contracts, said 
Kenneth Klee, a law professor at UCLA and attorney at Klee, Tuchin, Bogdanoff 
& Stern LLP in Los Angeles who specializes in corporate reorganization, 
bankruptcy law and insolvency. 

""The contracts clause of the Constitution, Article 1, Section 10, prevents 
the states from impairing the obligations of contracts,"" Klee said. ""I 
haven't seen the bill, but it occurs to me that if the state is trying to 
tell Edison it can pay creditors 70 percent, that would be unconstitutional."" 

Klee's firm represents two independent generators in the legal wranglings 
with Southern California Edison.

After the California experience demonized spot electricity  markets, it wou=

ices=20
in 2000 were below $30.00 per megawatt-hour (MWh), or three  cents per=20
kilowatt-hour (kWh), 70.88 percent of the hours in the year. The  single=20

In order to maintain and improve the functioning of the PJM  markets, the=
=20
Report recommends:

Retention of the $1000/MWh bid cap in the PJM energy market  and=20

Serving Entities (LSEs) to meet their obligations to serve load on a =20
longer-term basis, and require all capacity resources to be offered on a =

The Report uses several analytical methods to reach these  recommendations=

and conclusions, including looking at the net revenue for  generation from=

See Spot go to market
Perhaps the Report=01,s most intriguing  information on price trends concer=
ns=20
the spot energy market, where average  prices declined by 9.81 percent from=
=20
1999 levels. Driven by lower peak prices in  the most expensive 100 hours o=
f=20
the year, the average locational marginal price  (LMP) in 2000 was $30.72 p=
er=20

=20
(3.406 cents per kWh). This average price decline in  the spot market was=
=20
more significant because it occurred even though fuel costs  were sharply=
=20
higher in 2000. Indeed, the average fuel-adjusted LMP in 2000  declined to=
=20
$24.78 per MWh, or 27.25 percent from the 1999 price of $34.06 per  MWh.=20

And when one compares 2000 spot market prices to competitive  future prices=
=20
for the year 2000 and to 1996 regulated rates for generation, it  becomes=
=20
clear that spot market prices in 2000 were significantly lower than 2000 =
=20
future contracts. Even with appropriate price adjustments to facilitate =20
comparison, they were also much lower than 1996 regulated residential=20
generation  rates for all hours charged by Pennsylvania=01,s six major elec=

The lesson
Spot market prices, which received so much bad  publicity as a result of th=
e=20
California fiasco, can be a bargain and customers  who are able to manage=
=20
their demand to reduce or avoid the hours of high spot  prices can reap maj=
or=20
savings by purchasing electricity from the spot  market.

In fact, spot market prices in 2000 were below most of  Pennsylvania=01,s=

While the dramatically lower standard deviation in 2000 indicates  that=20

prices. =20


Grading on a curve
The PJM 2000 price duration curves,  measuring the percent of time prices=
=20
were at or below a particular level, tell  an interesting story. As one wou=
ld=20
expect with higher fuel prices, especially  for natural gas, the general=20
trend was for prices to be slightly higher during  periods where natural ga=
s=20
was the marginal fuel. For approximately 99 percent of  all hours, 2000=20
energy prices were more expensive than in 1999. Yet, with  relatively low=
=20
peak demand, the price for the most expensive 1 percent of demand  during=
=20
2000 was considerably lower in 2000 than in 1999, accounting for the  entir=
e=20
9.81 percent average reduction in 2000 prices from 1999. If not  for the=20
reduced prices for the most expensive 1 percent of demand, overall  prices=
=20
for 2000 likely would have risen approximately 18 percent over 1999, due =
=20
largely to higher fuel costs.=20

For these reasons, the Report recommendation to ""evaluate""  additional=20
actions to increase demand-side responsiveness is SEVERELY  understated. PJ=
M=20
and all consumers have an essential interest in implementing  demand-side=
=20
response programs to the maximum economic level, with dramatic  implication=
s=20
for saving individual consumers money, improving system  reliability, keepi=

Can everyone say I-C-A-P?
So with the lower wholesale  energy prices and plenty of supply, why did th=
e=20

Installed capacity (ICAP) price increases are a partial  explanation. In=20

Logically, the price for installed capacity, like the price of  energy, mig=

 =20
The result was an increase in ICAP prices from an average of $52.86 in 1999=
=20
to  $60.55 in 2000. The increase was concentrated over the summer with pric=
es=20
in the  daily markets rising to $177 or more for most of June, July and=20
August. The  increase in ICAP prices raised the cost of supplying many reta=
il=20

the price spikes  over the summer months were a direct result of the=20
opportunity cost associated  with the prices in neighboring control areas.

But the Report=01,s finding that the ICAP market was ""reasonably  competiti=

seems inconsistent with PJM=01,s conclusion last year that the 2000  ICAP m=

By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Federal energy regulators only have the authority 
to order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray 
Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to 
May 2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. 
Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from 
the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC 
lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent 
System Operator.
That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could 
potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. 
Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in 
unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC 
administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will 
likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis 
expects. 
Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., ""with one goal, 
and that is to bring back $9 billion."" 
Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO 
documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. 
David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general 
manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but 
conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. 
Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork 
for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from 
corporate energy suppliers. 
But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press 
secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about 
getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated 
by FERC. 
Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators 
overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. 
State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation 
into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on ""shaky 
calculations."" 
To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices 
received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been 
expected under competitive market conditions. 
The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at 
times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices 
in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with 
air-quality rules. 
The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern 
border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the 
fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. 
The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's ""Big Five"" power 
suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the 
conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. 
The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest 
utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid 
operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the 
documents. 
The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed 
amounts between May 2000 and February: American Electric Power Service Corp.

563,"All--  Attached are my proposed edits to the ""framework"" in redline
form.  The vast majority are simply editorial changes designed to clarify
language without changing the intended meaning.  I would call your
attention to Sections 5.1 and 6.3 as the potentially more substantive
suggestions.  Since the change to 6.3 primarily adds detail to what is
clearly described as a small customer proposal and not an agreed-upon item,
I would hope that it won't cause any problems.  The proposed change to 5.1
is not intended to change the agreed-upon allocation of costs, but simply
to provide us with some badly needed ""cover.""  Edison undercollections
would be recovered out of ""headroom"" in existing rates (as was our shared
intention), and those rates could only change as provided in Section
4.  Thus, core customers would not escape any of the charges that they are
expected to bear, but we would provide less of a fat target for others to
shoot at.  I can be available to discuss this further if needed after the
Senate Judiciary committee hearing on the MOU scheduled for Thursday
morning (415-254-3597).
         The proposed letter is another matter altogether.  It is so
replete with language that we find troubling that an attempt to edit it
seemed fruitless.  Lenny will circulate a much shorter proposed alternative
that simply states what the attached document is, without attempting to
characterize people's reasons for supporting it.  If that approach is not
acceptable, then TURN will not sign on to the letter itself but rather will
provide a sentence or two of explanation over our separate
signature.  Hopefully one or the other of these approaches will
work.   Thank you all for your hard work on this effort, but I must confess
that I did not personally find it to be ""oddly satisfying.""     MIKE

564,"On 6/20/01, I attended a Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
hearing regarding stationary internal combustion engines (including Diesel
Standby Generators).

The proposed regulation was ""framed"" in the following context:
BAAQMD is the only district in CA not now requiring permits for standby
engines 3-5k units are estimated in Bay Area, Avg. 350hp

While the previous hearings (5/11) had promised the final draft by 5/20/01,
the newest revisions were posted on Tuesday (6/19).  Evidently there were
last minute changes and a conclusion that the appropriate California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) document needs changes.  They may have
another workshop, possibly before the August 1st meeting, although it wasn't
clear if they can get the proper notices and input prior to that time.

The item was continued - Possible Final Action To Be Taken on August 1,
2001, although it may be continued again.

The new revisions are attached:
 <<r0908dr5.pdf>>  <<r0201dr6.pdf>>
They can be fount at:   http://www.baaqmd.gov/ruledev/reg-pmt/r0201ph1.htm

MY CONCLUSIONS AND QUESTIONS/CONCERNS THAT REMAIN
* It is doubtful that any rule change would be approved in time to provide
relief for this summer (2001).
* We remain under the old rule exemption for fixed standby generators that
has a limit of 200 hours per year emergency runtime and 100 hours testing
maximum.
* In Regulation 2, Rule 1 - 114.2 - 2.3 states exemption for ""Portable
internal combustion engines and standby internal combustion engines which
are at a location for less than 72 consecutive hours"".  Does this mean the
previous guideline of BAAQMD not regulating mobile sources unless in place a
year is now just 72 hours?

I am reviewing the proposed changes further and plan to participate in
future workshops and the hearing on August 1, 2001.

565,"Status Report
Much of the first half of May was dedicated to organizing stakeholders and
lobbying for the passage of SB 28x (Sher), which was the Legislature first
attempt at siting reform and included several IEP-sponsored proposals.  SB
28x was the last bill to be signed by the Governor and chaptered into law
before the close of the first extraordinary session.  The final version
included:

? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act
requirements.
? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the
CEC.
? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power
plant sites.
? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed
project.
? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency
review.
? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review for ""peaker""
plants and expanding the application to consider re-certification or
replacement.

There was also a small number of instances where Edson + Modisette assisted
on other issues at the request of IEP staff or IEP member companies.  As
always, Edson + Modisette is here if you need assistance on any other
issues.

Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process,
IEP member should now be thinking about what is next.  A list of IEP
proposals still on the table include:

? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for
power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance
? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies
? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements.
? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements

Assembly Member Calderon's office is currently reviewing these proposals in
conjunction with an effort to develop an environmental dispatch protocol.
IEP has weighed-in on this issue and has strongly advocated that 1)
reliability should always be the first priority; 2) protocol should be
limited to RMR units and out-of-market calls only; and, 3) any follow-up to
SB 28x should also consider IEP siting proposals left on the table.  I
circulated Asm. Calderon's proposed environmental dispatch language to IEP
members last Friday which targets those generating units running beyond
their air permits per the Governor's most recent executive order.  In the
short-term, I expect there will be additional stakeholders meetings on this
and other siting issues as Asm. Calderon decides how to proceed and in what
legislative vehicle.

All this action on the Assembly side does not rule out Senator Sher's part
on the siting issue.  Since SB 28x moved to the Governor's desk, Sen. Sher
has ensured us and others that that was only the first step and he would
like to continue pursuing additional siting reforms during this legislative
session.  SB 28xx in the second extraordinary session is currently a spot
bill ready to take up that cause.  There are pros and cons for either author
to move forward on siting reform, but I would recommend for the time being
that IEP let Asm. Calderon and Sen. Sher work out their turf wars while IEP
shares its proposals with both.

There are also other siting bills with the potential to move forward.  SB
86xx (Peace/Burton) was introduced last week which would require a developer
to begin construction on a project within 6 months of receiving
certification from CEC or lose its permit, and introduces the newly created
California Consumer Power and Financing Authority into the siting process.
Senator Morrow has called stakeholders together this week to provide input
on SB 76xx which is currently in spot bill format.  Asm. Wright still has
his siting vehicle, AB 48xx, poised to move if needed; and Sen. Battin has
several siting bills introduced also if needed.

I have mentioned this before, but it is worth repeating.  With the interest
in siting issues in the Capitol having waned only slightly, IEP members may
want to consider meeting again to develop a second list of proposed siting
reforms (in addition to the above issues left over from the first list).
Such a list should take into account the Governor's Executive Orders and
possibly what generators would be willing to give up to the enviros in
exchange for ""big ticket"" reforms.

Please call if you have any questions about the above invoice or any of the
siting issues pending before the Legislature.

597,"Joe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play 
given the owners.  Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the 
customer?  Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility?  
Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated 
structure in the RFP?

Is this a play that you would support? 

On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso 
note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?  It is important for us to be able to 
quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.

How is it going otherwise?

599,"Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position 
in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA 
could create significant value from a project that we have very little 
invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone 
and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, 
as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will 
argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to 
maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant 
dollars or taking significant risks.

Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.

Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

708,"Note:  This research is in sync with what the utilities and industry representatives were saying at the 
Wisconsin Winter Fuels Meeting--that coal prices are up over last year.  LB

Energy Insight News for Friday, October 19, 2001

Utilities should prepare for higher coal prices

Coal prices in the United States were in a trough for so long-take your
pick, 10, 15, 20 years, according to some-that big users-read, power
producers-may have been lulled to sleep.

Well, folks, the wakeup call is soon to be sounded, and, for some major
players, it may sound like a bugle blast in the ear. 

While spot market prices took off as long ago as July 2000, most major
producers were saved from swallowing the huge run-ups on the spot market
because utilities for the most part use long-term contracts to maintain a
hold on their fuel costs. 

However, while the evidence is strictly anecdotal-no buyer wants to tip his
hand to the competition-this much is known: A substantial amount of contract
coal comes off pact in 2002 and 2003. 

And suppliers, who have toiled under the mantra that they would make up for
low prices by increasing productivity-for example, cutting labor costs-are
raring to get what they believe they deserve. 

One big wild card in the upcoming battle for higher prices is how severe the
country's recession will be. Obviously, a long-term downturn dampens energy
usage so utilities and merchant players don't need to replenish their coal
stocks. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

745,"I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.",Lynn Blair,"260,000 1.5MM",the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement Special Services the Operator (TW the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives NWPL O&M Special Service FYI

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

Hi Tom,
1. Deal 1025953, we were billed for the total deal volume 1,350, 000MMBtu but we only show receiving 1,347,167MMBtu.(diff of   2833 MMBtu).
2. Deal 778374, we are being billed on the deal volume and not the actual volumes. I could not find the contract in Sitara to verify if we are to be billed on deal volumes and not actuals. How are we to adjust the variances from the deal volumes to the actuals.

Could you please shed some light on these issues or at least guide me to someone who can.

Thanks,

I followed up with the same IRS representative I spoke with in November
regarding your missing cheque.  I wish I had better news for the holiday
season.

Three traces were placed on your missing refund cheque and three times the
trace has been rejected.  The IRS doesn't know why.  They are placing a
formal inquiry into the matter.  The representative I spoke with has
admitted that somebody on the IRS' end isn't doing what they are supposed
to be doing and he promised me they'd get down to the matter.  I can only
tell you that I will follow up again in January of the new year.

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be 
submitted for the total available transportation capacity under the specified

available transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All 
other bids from the same Shipper for the same package of transportation 
capacity will be discarded.

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? 
Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; 
or if the maximum rate is bid, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x 
FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100. In case of a tie, 
each tied shipper will have the right to improve its bid by submitting an 
improved bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall 
be faxed to (801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie 
still exists, such capacity shall be awarded on a prorata basis.

to us at Tejas Laporte to help us out during an outage for $.02/mmbtu.  This 
transaction has not been scheduled correctly.  There are two deal tickets in 
Sitara to cover the Oasis portion of the deal:  #213145 covers ENA selling 
the gas to HPLC for HPLC to transport on Tejas.  Deal #213370 covers the 
transport usage on Tejas from Oasis Katy to Laporte.  I have edited this 
ticket to add the $.02/mm charge.  There needs to be a Tejas expense contract 
at Laporte, #665, to cover the approx. 25,000mm received there on the 7th.

808,"In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that Valero Texoma 
(#71) BAV volumes have not fed into POPS since 3/14 causing an out of balance 
at the meter in excess of 500,000mm month to date.  The more critical part of 
this problem, however, is that POPS has fed 0 volumes back to Sitara on some 
of the HPLC deals.  This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have 
not been picked up in Tom's P&L and are, instead, sitting in UA4.  To the 
extent that the purchase prices vary from the UA4 value, the P&L may take a 
hit when these actual volumes flow through.

I realize that Kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a 
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it's discovered.  
Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that Sitara is receiving 
correct information and the P&L is kept as accurate as possible.

appropriate ENA desks will take place either Wednesday or Thursday evening:

 CES - IM East   to ENA - IM East
 CES - IM Central  ENA - IM Central
 CES - IM Texas   ENA - IM Texas

This move will be done systematically for January forward business.  After 
this move is complete, there should be no active deals remaining on the CES 
desks.  The following is a list of deals that I wanted to bring to your 
attention and review.  One of the base assumptions expressed by all was that 
there were no transport usage tickets booked on the CES desk.  This is not 
true; however transport usage tickets will be included in the change over; 
therefore this will not be a problem.  On the East desk, three desk to desk 
deals will not be able to be converted (see below).  Once all CES deals have 
been changed to the East desk, I would imagine that these three desk to desk 
deals need to be killed.

Please advise if there are any questions regarding the desk move.  If any 
desk prefers to leave January as is and have deals moved February forward, 
manual deal entry will be involved (ending the deals as of 01/31/99 on the 
CES desk and creating a new deal on the appropriate physical desk).

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""

On Sat Oct 21, HPL meter # 1428 had a malfunction, and started flowing at a 
very high rate, way over the nominated rate of 18,000/d  (Gas Control will 
confirm this).

Since Sat-Sun-Mon are all one gas day from a Gas Daily perspective, I told 
Gas Control to try to balance on Sun after the meter was fixed, by cutting 
back to a lower flow rate.

So we will need to do a special allocation for the three days October 21 - 
23, Saturday through Monday.  The three day total for the meter is 59,067 
MMBtu.  Beaumont Methanol nominated 54,000 MMBtu (i.e. 18,000/d for 3 
days).   We should allocate a total of 54,000 MMBtu to Beaumont Methanol for 
the three days, and the 5,067 MMBtu excess will be purchased by Brandywine -

896,"Introduction

In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide, we have 
upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we 
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your 
products.

This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days. 
Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade.

Summary of New Features

Multiple Children - A ""Child"" product can be the ""Parent"" of another Child 
(multiple links in a chain) and different types of links can be placed 
against a single Parent.

Static Product Bar Prices - When you change a price in the Product Bar and 
hit the ""+"" or ""-"" button, the price stays - it does not reset to the amount 
in Product Properties until you logout.

Sorting - You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on 
the title of the field. For multiple sorts, hold down your ""shift"" key.

Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis 
relationship identified. (e.g. The Product bar might before have said: ""Basis 
Link - Parent"" and now would say ""Stand Alone, Parent"").


Detailed Feature Descriptions


Multiple Children

The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together 
in a long chain. For example, Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product 
B, which is in turn linked to Parent Product C.

Warning: Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a 
chain, system performance is degraded by large chains. This is because when a 
customer attempts a transaction, the database must ""lock"" each and every 
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request. The 
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the 
locks. ""Vertical"" chains (multiple parents and children in one long link) are 
much slower to process than ""Flat"" chains (One parent with many children). 
Large vertical chains should be avoided. 

Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the 
same parent. For example, Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent 
Product B. At the same time, Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link 
to the same Parent Product B. Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated 
Basis link and a regular Basis Link.


Static Product Bar Prices

The new version of EnronOnline provides for ""sticky"" Product Bar price and 
volume changes. When you change a number on the Product Bar, it does not 
reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you 
have logged out. This makes it easier to update prices, volumes, spreads or 
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the ""+"" or ""-"" buttons. 

One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it 
reduces repeated price movements. With the old version of Stack Manager, if 
the price delta was too small, traders would often repeatedly hit the price 
movement buttons. Each of these price changes must be communicated across the 
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth. This makes it harder 
for customers to transact with us - each time they try, a new price update 
moves the price, resulting in an increased transaction failure rate. Entering 
an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price 
movement button means that fewer (but larger) price movements are necessary, 
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure 
rate.

You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices - a new field 
for Offset to Last Trade. This allows you to update the offset for Products 
which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu.


Sorting/Selecting

The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting 
functionality over the old. You can now choose any field heading (Type, 
Location, Reference Period,  etc.) and sort by that item. You can do multiple 
sorts by holding down the shift key. Example: If you select Type and then 
Location while holding the shift key, you will see your products sorted first 
by Product Type and then within each Product Type, by Location (in 
alphabetical order).

If you right click on the Product menu, you can choose from the same sort 
criteria, plus you can select ""Sort by Web Order"", which allows you to see 
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the 
website (note however, that a customer on the website might be also seeing a 
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing).

When you select products, you can drag your mouse while holding down the left 
mouse button as always, but now you can also hold down the <ctrl> key while 
making your selections. This allows you to highlight products which are not 
necessarily adjacent to one another.


Parent Products and F/X Products

One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its 
treatment of how parent products are displayed. The old version showed the 
type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar (to the left of 
the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs). The new version 
does not show the type of link. This is because the new version allows for 
more than one type of link on each parent product.

Some traders may notice that  their  products which have f/x links are now 
identified with a stylised ""fx"" in the Product list. This is to enable easy 
identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the 
parent, rather than managed individually.

General Feedback

If you have any comments on the new functionality, or suggestions for further 
functionality, please call David Forster on 713 853 1861. If you had 
previously suggested new functionality which didn't make it into this 
release, rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard 
to improve all elements of EnronOnline and will try to incorporate your 
requests into the next release of the EnronOnline Stack Manager.

deferring any to other people.  Ray and Keith, please talk to Gary Zahn and 
make sure you are up to speed on everything FERC has asked for and focused on 
so far.  You don't need to be an expert on all that, but a basic 
understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more 
responsive to what they want to ask you about.  If you do get stumped, try to 
defer the question by telling FERC you need to check on a fact or two and can 
answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview.  By doing 
that , you should be able to get them the information they need without 
having them cross examine a bunch of other people.  Inevitably, if you ask 
enough people the same question, you may start getting different answers.

EEI's State Restructuring Service is proud to present an Internet E-Forum to 
investigate whether the problems of California could occur in other parts of 
the country.

The California ""restructuring earthquake"" is marked by the doubling of some 
electric bills, multi-billion dollar utility under collections, electric 
reserve margin problems, and consumer outrage.  While these problems are the 
result of numerous factors, some may be replicated in other parts of the 
country.  This E-Forum will look at six regions of the county to see if the 
same ""tremors"" will be felt in those regions and if not, why not.  Our 
speakers will address the following questions:

Will your region see price spikes next summer?

What reliability challenges might your region experience next year?

Do any changes in state or federal laws or regulations need to be made?

How will retail markets be impacted by other factors such as, market 
structure, dependence on a spot market, high gas prices, and environmental

919,"PG&E Sues to Recover $3 Billion 

Exploring yet another legal avenue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday 
filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling 
that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in 
uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May 
when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned 
utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 
levels. 

The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved, 
therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to 
the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public 
Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover 
its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit 
charge. 

""We're just keeping our legal options open,"" said a San Francsco-based 
utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect 
its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and 
another California utility on a ""rating negative watch."" 

State and federal officials all acknowledge as part of a series of ongoing 
investigations that California's current wholesale electricity market is 
broken and noncompetitive in its current state, said Roger Peters, senior 
vice president and general counsel for Pacific Gas and Electric. ""However, 
there has not yet been any concrete action by regulators to provide for 
recovery of the costs we have incurred to purchase the power our customers 
must have, either through refunds from power sellers who charged unfair 
prices, or through retail rates. These costs are continuing to grow."" 

Noting both the unfairness and unpopularity of the skyrocketing wholesale 
charges, PG&E's utility nevertheless said it has a legal right to recover the 
charges from its almost four million customers, and it reiterated five steps 
it has taken to ""increase supply, moderate customer demand, repair the broken 
wholesale market and provide stable, reasonable rates."" ",Roger Peters,$3 Billion nearly $3 billion,"PG&E Pacific Gas and Electric Co. the California Supreme Court California Public

Is Grounding a Substitute for Surge Suppression Protection?

One of the most common questions regarding Surge Suppression is whether it
is necessary when a grounding system exists. Proper grounding is necessary
for the Instrumentation and Automation systems in use today, but is no
substitute for Surge Suppression equipment in preventing electrical system
damage. Grounding should only be part of the strategy in preventing
equipment damage from electrical surges.

An electrical surge is a burst of voltage that lasts only a matter of
microseconds but which generates very large amounts of current, and this
current must be diverted away from the electrical equipment to be protected.
Some people hold the opinion that if a grounding system is installed, the
electrical system voltage will rise together and lower together and that no
damage to the equipment will occur. While this could be true in theory, the
reality is that very few installations are isolated from other voltages. For
example, the addition of computers with modems or network cards introduces
another ground into the system.

If the two buildings are separated electrically, then the possibility of
damage is minimized, but it is more likely that modems or data lines
interconnect the buildings. A typical scenario might be:

 A lightning strike in the vicinity of one building increases the
 ground potential to 200KV.

 The resistance of the ground decreases this voltage to 15KV
 by the time it gets to the ground circuit of that building.

 As the voltage decreases over the distance to the adjacent
 building, it has lowered to 3KV, with a resulting difference
 of 12KV.

In such a case, the voltage difference between the two buildings generates a
surge current large enough to destroy the communication lines between the
two buildings, and no grounding system can prevent the damage to the
communication ports of the computers. Similarly, any instruments mounted
outdoors can have the same type of voltage difference from the control panel
to which they are connected.

Therefore, while good grounding is essential, it will not neutralize the
potential damage to equipment and processes caused by a surge event.

Thanks!",Drew - Steve Tom,,
923,"I agree with you that par. 4 doesn't give NMNG anything beyond what the 
tariff and general contract law gave them.  The ""subject to agreement by 
Transwestern"" language is redundant since the previous clause says "" by 
mutual written agreement.""  Additionally, its confusing and innacurate 
because the ""provided, however, that"" clause isn't even binding if we 
mutually agree to eliminate it.   I therefore think we ought to take par. 4 
out, or at least remove the ""provided however"" clause.  I don't agree that we 
can only decrease their MDQ by using capacity release.  We can mutually agree 
to terminate their contract or reduce their MDQ without using cap. release.  
I suppose we would need to use cap. release if the termination or reduction 
of their MDQ was a sham designed to get the capacity from NMNG to another 
shipper, however. 

I would propose one change to Par. 3 just to make the discount more clear.  
The par. talks about primary delivery points but is silent on primary 
receipts.  I'd add this, after the words ""Appendix A"" at the end of the 
current first sentence:

""and receipts at the primary points of receipt set forth on Appendix A.  The 
discounted rate shall also apply to receipts at alternate receipt points in 
Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) area.""

I'm a fan of being extremely clear when we limit availability of discounts, 
and think we should always fully explain what the discount applies to at both 
the receipt and delivery end of the deal.  

Susan, please work with Christine to get these changes made.  I'd like to 
eliminate par. 4 entirely, but I can live with it if the business people want 
to leave it in, as long as we eliminate the ""provided however"" clause.   With 
these changes, I'm OK with the contract.  Thanks.

Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I=

the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.

***

To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20

all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma=

Application for declaratory order must include:

1.  Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate=20

933,"MidAm advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline, probably today, 
to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the Carlton timing problem 
(i.e., the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement).  
If Midam does so, Enforcement will then contact Northern for a 
response--probably Dari or MKM or I, but who knows who they'll call.
If they do, the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary 
response to MidAm:

1.  Midam, and all of our customers, are aware that a Commission order on the 
June 2, 2000 Settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for 
this Nov-March period can be determined.  The flow obligation for sourcers 
like MidAm will be slightly higher--by about 3%--if the settlement is 
approved.  For all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation 
numbers would be under the two scenarios, settlement approval or settlement 
non-approval, we have given that information.  We gave that information to 
MidAm also.  We can't file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number 
for this heating season until the Commission addresses the settlement.

2.  The true financial impact of the current uncertainty on MidAm is 
minimal.  We believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based 
on the lower flow obligation number, but with an option to increase their 
purchase quantity if the Commission approves the settlement.  MidAm may have 
done that, but we don't know.  If not, and if the Commission approves the 
Settlement, their only real ""cost"" would arise if they have to buy the 
additional flow obligation volume--about 1100 MMBtu/d for MidAm--now at a 
higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they 
locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply.    Given the large drop 
in gas prices the last several days, there may not be any increased cost.   

3.  The bottom line is that we really need an order on the Settlement.  The 
majority of Northern's customers support it as a fair solution to the Carlton 
problem.  MidAm is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues.  
MidAm is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old Carlton 
mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving 
that windfall.    


That's the end of the proposed script.  The last bullet may go to far, but I 
like it.  Frank and Steve, MKM suggested that you guys get Doering and Gorak 
and others to call FERC (hotline or otherwise--I don't think it matters) and 
express their concern that the order is not on the agenda.  DF  ","Carlton Midam Dari MKM Frank Steve Doering Gorak

I will see if we have any updates, although I doubt we would change the number from last we met.  I believe the presentation of the numbers has caused some confusion.  We are forecasting a (5.2) recurring loss, plus a (13.8) loss on Marlin, totaling (19.0) loss.  I think you added the 19 and the 5.2 to get to the 24.2 you have listed below.

982,"Chris has already answered one question--I'll try to answer another.   Here 
is the way the deal works as it relates to storage and intra-day swing 
volumes.
CES-Retail provides us with a first of the month daily sales number and a 
monthly storage number.  The estimated sales numbers are outlined for the 
entire term of the deal in the exhibit--each month, during bid week they must 
provide us with their final number, which must be within 10% plus or minus 
the numbers on the exhibit.  Anything outside of this range is an agreed upon 
price at the time it is proposed.  The monthly storage numbers are provided 
on the proxy schedule--we already have those numbers for the remaining term 
of the agreement--these cannot be modified without mutual agreement.  In a 
given month, however, CES has 5% flexibility on their total monthly volume.

Now, for the daily volume issue.  CES provides us with its nomination by 
10:00 a.m., including the amount of gas it needs from storage.  If they call 
us with a change to this storage number intra-day, then we must make the 
change on their behalf, including buying gas to prevent them from incurring 
overrun charges.  The price of any incremental sales volumes is completely 
negotiable at that time.   If ENA is using any storage capacity for its own 
benefit during this type of situation, and CES' new nomination is still under 
its storage MDQ, but our nomination causes us to exceed the MDQ, then we are 
at risk for any overrun charges.  HOWEVER, if CES never calls with a change 
and their volumes increase significantly, causing overruns (even if ENA is 
using some of the storage capacity), CES is responsible for any overrun costs 
or penalties.

Hopefully this all makes sense--if not, I'll be happy to have a meeting to 
walk through different situations.  Anyway, from a customer service 
perspective, we definitely need to advise CES-Retail each and every time as 
soon as we find out their volumes have changed with no notification to us and 
it causes them some incremental overrun or other charge.

987,"Revision in bold.  Pass on to any who may need this.

In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara 
was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same 
Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is 
tagged as ""Primary"".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity 
tickets to reflect the ""other"" desks:

a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path 
Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like   
""Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 
and will be removed.""
b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract 
that you were using in the new path.
c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy.
d.  On the new deal:
 Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply 
or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a deal for which we are 
  agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new 
desk.  The ""primary"" deal will carry the actual Agent.  The Agent
  contract will get cleared.  Re-select the Agent Contract.
 Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select 
the Pipeline contract.
 Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.  
Un-check it.
 On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated 
rates, uncheck them as well.  The ""primary"" deal will carry the MDQ and
  any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.
 Hit Release.
e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number 
in the Service list now read ""Multiple"".  Right-click/Service Deals will list 
the  specific deals.
f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message 
should not appear again.

This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract.

994,"Gloria,
I'm sorry but as a manager, I spent the vast portion of my days and evenings 
involved in trading activities, in  meetings and trying to put out fires.  I 
have also been receiving on average 2 or 3 of these requests per day and I 
usually don't even begin looking at these until 6 in the evening.  Some are 
quick fixes, but the majority lately have not been.  Todays calendar isn't 
looking much better.

I contacted Wade on this last week, but have not received anything.  I hate 
to hold you back from making your payments, which is why we have spent 
another good chunk of time justifying a new position under Carrie Hollomon to 
handle these types of requests.  That position is now to be filled by Teri 
Franklin.  I'm sure that she is not totally up to speed on everything such as 
sitara, so please continue to be patient for awhile.  

So that this whole process might be sped up a little faster, I would like to 
suggest that you obtain the pricing information from either Lashonda or Wade 
and then pass the information that you need set up in it's entirety to Teri.  
If the information is provided in it's entirety this will keep us from 
setting up deals with incorrect pricing.  Which then causes us to have to go 
back and do further rework when either Wade of Lashonda informs us of the 
error, which is exactly what I received an
email on earlier this morning.  


Teri,

If you need any help with sitara or any other type of training in setting up 
these deals, please let either myself, Victor, Chris, or Brenda know and we 
will try to answer your questions.  Thanks for your help!

As requested, Enron North America Corp. is confirming that Sacramento Municipal Utility District has acquired Parcel 8887.0 and a portion of Parcel 8889.0 through the capacity release process.  Both of SMUD's bids are not contingent on satisfying any conditions, therefore, the capacity described below should be awarded effective February 1, 2002.  

Parcel 8887.0:

Unfortunately, no one bid on the remaining 42,500 Dth/day of capacity in Parcel 8889.0, or the 10,099 Dth/day of capacity in Parcel 8885.0 which terminates on 10/31/02.

follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.

1026,"Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a 
number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller 
pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde 
said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF 
+$.09 for gas this month.

EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell 
it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde 
is going to check around.

1028,"The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 8/1and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Consolidated Edison I     30,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
ConEdison Energy I     10,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35

Virginia Power  II  100,000  10  Trenton-Woodbury $0.30
PPL Energy Plus II     30,000  10  Princeton Junction $0.18

 Phase 1 begins 11/1/01.  Phase II begins 11/1/02.  The rates shown are for 
the demand and are the rates that Transco had been marketing for the 
project.  Each shipper is responsible for fuel and the electric power 
commodity charge and ACA.  There will be no GRI or Great Plains commodity 
surcharges.  The Manhattan and PSEG delivery points are Transco Zone 6 NY 
points.  The Camden, Trenton-Woodbury and Princeton Junction points are 
non-NY.
 Williams reduced their precedent agreement volume from 210,000 Dthd to the 
100,000 Dthd.  Williams' rights to PSEG points are north of the Linden 
allocation point.  Virginia Power is buying a project from Statoil on the 
Trenton-Woodbury line.  Virginia Power's commitment to MarketLink replaces 
one of Statoil's two precedent agreements.  Statoil has also sold another 
project that was underlying their second precedent agreement.  The new and 
unnamed project owner has requested and been granted an extension to the 
90,000 Dthd precedent agreement for a later phase of MarketLink.  Sunset 
Energy Fleet has requested and been granted an extension for their 95,600 
Dthd precedent agreeement.  LFG, a landfill gas developer, has also been 
granted an extension of their 5,000 Dthd precedent agreement to enable LFG to 
finalize a sale with a new owner or to locate an alternative landfill site.  
PPL Energy Plus has the right to deliver into a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL Interstate Energy Company pipeline system in Lower Mt. Bethel 
Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania or a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL's Eden plant in East Drumore Township, Lancaster County, 
Pennsylvania on a primary basis.  They also have the right to extend their 
agreement at the $0.18 rate for an additional two five year terms.  Dynegy 
(30,000 Dthd) and Engage (210,000 Dthd) terminated their respective precedent 
agreements.  Due to these terminations and reductions,  Transco only has 
announced precedent agreements of 190,600 Dthd for later phases.  If these 
precedent agreements become contracts, MarketLink would have 486,600 Dthd of 
shipper volume.  Transco has stated that all 700,000 Dthd of MarketLink would 
be built by 11/01/04.","Dthd Williams Dynegy

Problem:  Third party demand reimbursements for transport are kept on 
spreadsheets.  I would like to automate this process.  

Solution:  Is it possible to enter a capacity ticket with a counterparty 
(like ConEd), not a pipeline, and show a negative amount (or the opposite of 
what we enter in when we are paying out a charge) therefore resulting in a 
credit to the desk for that amount?    Would the system accept such an entry 
and would this generate the proper documentation for accounting?

For example, if the East Desk has a deal where ConEd releases capacity to ENA 
at max rate, but then reimburses ENA for the demand charge (ENA pays the 
commodity costs), the tickets would be entered as follows:
 1) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charges of $.10, 
Counterparty = Transco   -   ENA will pay $$$ to the pipeline
 2) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charge of -.10, 
Counterparty = Con Ed        -   ENA will receive $$$ from ConEd

It seems like this should work and would eliminate one more manual piece of 
this transport p&l.  
Please advise.",Con Ed,.10 $$$,the East Desk ENA Transco

The Operating Guides WG, with much support from Bob Brodie of KEMA
Consulting, have been working to conform the ERCOT Operating Guides with
the new market structure as defined in the Protocols pending approval at
the PUC and scheduled to be implemented on June 1, 2001.

Attached is a zip file containing a complete version of the 'NEW' Operating
Guides for your review and comment.   The intent is to have the Guides
ready for review and hopefully approval by TAC's newly created
subcommittees at their first meetings of 2001.  This message is being sent
to the members of the 2000 TAC subcommittees (ES/RSS/TMOS) in anticipation
that there will be significant overlap between the membership of the 2000
subcommittees and the 2001 subcommittees.

There will be a meeting/workshop in Austin on Tuesday, January 9 to collect
and discuss your comments on the attached document.  The specific location
will be provided later,  but the meeting will start at 9:30 and end by
4:00.

The first thing you will notice is a very different document structure and
format.  Of note, they contain Hidden text.  If you are using a WORD
version earlier than 2000, there are a couple of options you will want to
enable to be able to see and/or print this text.  From the Word tool bar,
go to  Tools / Options.  Select the View tab and make sure the Hidden Text
box is checked to be able to see it on your screen.  Select the Print tab
and check the Hidden Text box to have it printed.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this effort as you start your busy
new year.

On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises.

1113,"Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Here is the spreadsheet for valuing and hedging the quanto swap. It prices the swap for one day. Please note the delta position on gas that needs to be taken since inception. The gas position changes as we enter into the correlated period (hit F9 to see different scenarios). 

For the sake of simplicity I used a zero interest rate (that does not change the hedging issues). ""TS"" is the ticker size (MMBTUs/HDDs). I made it the unit for simplicity also.

pretty sure she would call and tell you that.  What a dork! You know what, I 
am starting to get sick too and it sucks because Burnsy is coming into town 
this weekend.   Anyway hopefully I will get better.  
Well, my good streak came to an end after a whopping one week when I found 
out that my grandma is in a comma and will only live another day or two and 
my dad is in the hospital again with a blod clot in his heart and will be 
there a week and maybe longer..  It is really hard to be sitting up here and 
not be with my family right now but I think and hope they understand. And I 
will be going down there next weekend to visit and apparently for my 
grandmothers funeral.  My mom is not doing well at all and I really wish I 
could be there for her.  She doesn't deal with loss very well.  
On a positive note it looks like i will probably start trading real time 
energy in the next few weeks. I am moving to that department and I am sooooo 
excited about it.  The only thing that sucks is that it is a lot like fire 
fighter hours in that you have to work night shifts.  It works three days on 
then three days off, three nights on three days off and then once a month you 
get six days in a row off.  So in a month you get a ton more days off but, 
you have to work some nights and some weekends which sucks.  That part will 
be sweet but I am not too excited about working the 6pm to 6am shift.  But it 
also entails a raise of $4500 due to the hours so all in all it should be a 
positive move.  Anyway how is everything with you?",Burnsy,4500,

become general counsel of ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal 
department will be responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron 
Global Assets businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, 
coordinated by Lance Schuler, will be provided from EWS - Legal in Houston to 
support ESA's wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce 
Lundstrom, general counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect 
to the EGA businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the 
new structure is attached.

We believe this new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality 
legal support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

E.ON May Be Closing in on Purchase of Powergen

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from Reuters] German utility E.ON AG is near a deal to take a=20
stake in Britain's fourth largest power utility Powergen (NYSE: PWG) at a=
=20
price 30 percent above current levels. According to the German paper=20
Handelsblatt, E.ON's supervisory board reportedly will make a final decisio=
n=20
in the next week. Powergen, meanwhile, said it is still in talks on a=20
possible offer from another company. ""There can be no assurance that these=
=20
discussions will result in an offer being made for the company,"" Powergen=
=20
said in a statement. The company first announced that it was in talks to be=
=20
purchased on Jan. 16.=20

Analysis: The word that E.ON, Europe's second largest power company, would=
=20
buy a stake in Powergen at a fat 30-percent premium of around 6.90 pounds=
=20
increased Powergen's British stock price by as much as 7 percent to reach 7=
39=20
pence. A combination of the two companies would create a power firm on par=
=20
with Europe's largest power companies, France's EDF and Italy's Enel. Since=
=20
talks about a potential acquisition by E.ON surfaced in January, Powergen's=
=20
stock price has climbed 21 percent. In addition, according to Reuters,=20
Powergen jumped to the top of the gainers list for the United Kingdom's FTS=
E=20
100 blue chip index. On March 22, Powergen stock reached 739 pence, while t=
he=20
FTSE 1000 index was down 2.5 percent at 27-month lows. Powergen also trades=
=20
in the United States on the New York Stock Exchange, where Powergen shares=
=20
opened March 26 at $42.00.=20

If the rumors about Powergen's price tag are true, E.ON would end up paying=
=20
more than nine pounds a share or six billion pounds (U.S. $8.5 billion) for=
=20
the U.K.-based Powergen, which carries a debt of about 5.2 billion pounds.=
=20
These projections exceed previous reports from financial analysts who=20
suggested that E.ON would pay no more than eight pounds a share for Powerge=
n.=20
E.ON might be feeling increased pressure to finalize a deal with Powergen=
=20
since other players such as Scottish Power have also expressed interest in=
=20
the company. With significant capital to spend (Reuters reported up to $50=
=20
billion including proposed divestitures), E.ON reportedly believes that=20
Britain, where demand is outpacing the rest of Europe, is the best country =
in=20
which to begin a rapid expansion strategy. Despite the fact that Powergen h=
ad=20
previously acknowledged that it was working on a deal with E.ON, over the=
=20
last week it has maintained that discussions continue with other companies.=
 =20

E.ON, formed as a result of last year's merger between Veba and Viag,=20
supplies Germany and Europe with electricity, heating, natural gas, water a=
nd=20
petroleum. Germany, which opened 100 percent of its energy market all at on=
ce=20
in April 1998, has undergone a period of rapid consolidation. As a result,=
=20
the largest power companies in the country have begun seeking competitive=
=20
opportunities across the Continent (this is a growing trend in Europe as=20
companies from other countries are following the same competitive strategy)=
.=20
E.ON must expand outside of its home country, where analysts have speculate=
d=20
that core profits in its generation business have become unstable. In many=
=20
ways, consolidation is a means of survival for E.ON, as Europe continues to=
=20
liberalize and electricity prices fall as a result. =20

Powergen=01*which generates about 14 percent of the electricity used in Eng=
land=20
and Wales and has electric and gas operations throughout Europe, India, Asi=
a=20
and Australia=01*is a company that became known for its global expansion=20
efforts, especially in the United States. Just last December, Powergen=20
completed a $3.2 billion acquisition of Louisville, Ky.-based LGOEnergy Cor=
p.=20
Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the U.S. market, as a result=
=20
of consolidation that had taken place in the United Kingdom. The acquisitio=
n=20
of LGObecame appealing to Powergen because of the U.K. company's desire to=
=20
establish a strong presence in the Midwest market. Altogether, LG&E's two=
=20
utilities and numerous unregulated businesses total about $5 billion in=20
assets, which was thought to support any further expansion that Powergen=20
might have had in mind. =20

Powergen has a market capitalization of $6.66 billion and P/E ratio of 11.0=
2=20
(according to Yahoo Finance). However, the company has struggled over the=
=20
last year. Powergen's primary subsidiary, LGOEnergy, saw its profit for 200=
0=20
decline by 4 percent to $497 million from $518 million. As the parent=20
company, Powergen saw its profits decline by 12 percent in 2000, to $518=20
million from $590 million, although its revenue increased 11 percent to $6=
=20
billion, up from $5.4 billion in 1999. Keep in mind that Powergen's=20
acquisition of LGOwas not completed until December 2000, so LG&E's earnings=
=20
will be reflected fully in its parent's financial report starting this year=
. =20

If E.ON were to acquire Powergen, it would gain several strategic advantage=
s.=20
E.ON would no longer be reliant solely on the German market, where falling=
=20
prices and continued consolidation limit competitive opportunities. In=20
addition, the purchase would give E.ON a hold on generating assets in the=
=20
United Kingdom, and the comparatively low-cost power production, 3.7 millio=
n=20
customers and various business operations that LGOoffers in the United=20
States. =20

As noted, Powergen has acknowledged that it has received approaches from E.=
ON=20
and other companies. Based on available reports, those ""other companies"" ar=
e=20
most likely RWE (Germany's largest power supplier and a rival of E.ON),=20
Vivendi and Suez Lyonnaise (French mega-utilities) and an unnamed American=
=20
power company (Enron or Southern Energy would be my best guess). However,=
=20
word from its management team is that Powergen is not interested in getting=
=20
tied up (as a purchased entity) in merger or acquisition proceedings at thi=
s=20
time as it may be planning additional purchases of its own in the United=20
States. =20

On the other hand, the rationale for Powergen to be sold to a company like=
=20
E.ON is taking shape. British restructuring law has forced large generators=
=20
to sell power stations to reduce any likelihood of market power. As a resul=
t,=20
Powergen has morphed from a pure U.K. generating company to a broad-based=
=20
company engaged in telecommunications, gas, and distribution services. Ed=
=20
Wallis, Powergen's CEO, has stated that presently it has become very=20
difficult for Powergen to compete with larger rivals in an enlarged Europea=
n=20
market. As noted, Powergen's strategy over the last year has been one of=20
further expansion in the United States, and the purchase of LGOwas perhaps=
=20
more expensive than Powergen had planned. In order to make further U.S.=20
acquisitions, Powergen needs adequate capital or equity in order to finance=
=20
the acquisition, something that has become more difficult since its purchas=
e=20
of LG&E. =20

Nevertheless, if the deal takes place it will require regulatory approval i=
n=20
the United States from FERC, the SEC and the Kentucky Public Service=20
Commission (among other possible agencies). The climate for U.S. energy=20
industry mergers and acquisitions has become rather turbulent in recent=20
weeks. Three high-profile mergers (Entergy / FPL Group, Con Edison /=20
Northeast Utilities and Sierra Pacific Resources / Portland General) have a=
ll=20
encountered difficulties that could derail their pending deals. In addition=
,=20
according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal, announced worldwid=
e=20
mergers and acquisitions this year totaled $390.4 billion (as of March 21),=
=20
which is about one-third of the volume during the same period last year.=20
Also, about 164 merger deals have been withdrawn from the market, compared=
=20
with 153 deals that were withdrawn for the same period last year, according=
=20
to the WSJ report. =20

Analysts that have been closely watching the potential for an E.ON / Powerg=
en=20
deal say that Powergen's U.S. operations in LGOcould prove to be a major=20
stumbling block for the two companies, and that E.ON may find U.S. regulato=
ry=20
requirements to be much more stringent than those in Europe. Specifically,=
=20
the SEC has strict rules regarding what kinds of companies can own public=
=20
utilities (a category into which LGOfalls) and E.ON's diverse, non-power=20
operations may send some red flags to American regulators.  Consequently,=
=20
although E.ON appears rather confident that this deal will be completed=20
rather soon, Powergen's reported resistance and U.S. regulatory obstacles m=
ay=20
thwart this yet-to-be-formally-announced partnership.  =20

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make=

GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

? On-line expense reporting tool XMS =01) XMS, our online expense reporting=

all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for=20
reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to=20
http://xms.enron.com/. =20

? Enterprise wide portal =01) We currently have 122 internal web sites acro=
ss=20

r=20

It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access conte=

r=20
for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new=20
company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched i=
n=20
several phases beginning this fall. =20

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is=
=20
travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As=
=20
we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating=
=20
those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advanta=
ge=20
of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and=20
booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company=
=20
without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are=
=20
common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling fo=
r=20
business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations=
=20
will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

? Air travel =01) Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in th=

=20
all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by=
=20
GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking=20
service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same=20
negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book=
=20
non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than=20
refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee. =
=20
For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase=20
non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

? Lodging =01) GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel=
=20
chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit=01,s=20
individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron=01,s list of pref=
erred=20
hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit=01=
,s=20
policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

? Car rental services =01) When renting a car for business travel, employee=
s=20
should use our preferred car rental agencies =01) National (U.S. and Canada=
) and=20
Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to prote=
ct=20
you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit=20

? Off-site meetings =01) All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events wit=
h=20
more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate=

1170," ISO Market Participants:

 As you may know, the ISO Governing Board, at their March 15, 2001
meeting, approved in concept the Market Stabilization Plan (MSP) proposed by
the ISO. Although there was no formal motion, they directed Management to
proceed with the plan and prepare a filing to be submitted to FERC this
week. The proposed MSP and Lorenzo Kristov's presentation are posted on the
ISO's web site at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/03/09/2001030913380120705.html.

 When we discussed this proposal at the conference call on March 9,
participants identified some implementation issues that would need to be
addressed in order to implement the MSP. In addition, many of you have
certainly identified other implementation issues since March 9.

 On Tuesday, March 27, the ISO will host a conference call from 11:00
a.m. to 2:00 p.m. PST to discuss MSP implementation issues. The call-in
information is as follows:

 Call In Number: (877) 381-6005

 Conference ID: 98843

 Conference Leader: Byron Woertz

 The purpose of the conference call is to provide Market Participants
with additional MSP implementation information and to answer questions that
Participants may have. In addition, the ISO will describe resource-specific
data that is needed from Participants for development of cost-based bids to
be used for resources bid into the market. Please note that we will not
discuss policy issues or whether the MSP should be implemented. We will
assume for this discussion that the ISO proceeds with implementing the plan
as presented to the Board and will address only those issues that would
affect our ability to implement the proposed MSP.

 If youwo have already identified specific implementation issues or

1171,"Hello, Everyone -

This Notice confirms our meeting for this coming Friday, March 23, 2001,
from 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. at the Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel.
Because there are fewer items on the agenda, this RRG meeting should be
shorter than usual, and we hope to wrap up by 11:00 a.m.

The purpose of the meeting is primarily to discuss with the RRG a phased
approach to implementing congestion management.  The filing utilities are
very aware of the concerns many parties have expressed about process
overload, and the burden this imposes on you. Consequently, the filing
utilities are considering a more focused process that will call for
prioritizing the work streams over the next few weeks.  Part of this more
focused process is a proposal for a potential phasing of congestion
management implementation. A background paper for your review before the
meeting is attached.

The working agenda is:

1. Market Monitoring:  Recommendation Regarding Stage 1 Decision

2. Clarification of RTO West Treatment of Losses

3. Clarification of Stage 1 Decision on Interconnection Standards

4.. Potential Phasing of Congestion Management Implementation

5. Report on TransConnect

6. Benefit-Cost Study

A word about the new benefit-cost study.  It is my view that before we can
profitably engage in a new study that will be useful to regional parties a
number of issues need to be resolved first.  For example, it will be
important to know and not just assume what the scope and regional
configuration of RTO West is likely to be.  We are all waiting for FERC's
response to the October 23 filing and its declaratory order regarding the
RTO West scope and regional configuration as proposed in the October 23
application.  The reason for my uncertainty and the need for clarification
on scope and regional configuration is FERC's press release of March 14 in
which it ""encouraged the formation of a regional transmission organization
(RTO) for the western markets.""  What does this mean for RTO West? In
addition to understanding the scope of RTO West, it will also be important
to know and not just assume what the congestion and pricing models will be
for RTO West.  Determining these models will probably take a few more weeks.
As we discussed in earlier RRG meetings, a benefit-cost analysis may become
important parts of filings with the various state commissions.
Understanding what the state commissions are looking for is also important.
Because of  the need for this information, and the more focused process we
are considering, I have recommended to the filing utilities that the
benefit-cost work be deferred until these issues are resolved.  I would
appreciate your views on this subject at the RRG meeting as well.

I look forward to seeing you this Friday, March 23.

a
pop and dance channel featuring familiar names like Christina Aguilera,
Selena and Gloria Estefan. The other is ""Latino Mix"" - a ""Top 40""
format featuring an eclectic mix of chart toppers like Ricky Martin and
Alejandro Sanz. Links to all three Latin channels are below.

A NEW NETRADIO EXCLUSIVE: Q&A WITH MICHAEL MCDONALD

Driving down a Tennessee highway, solo artist and former Doobie Brothers
front man Michael McDonald dialed up NetRadio for a conversation with
staff writer Steve Marsh. In our exclusive Q&A, McDonald discussed playing
live, his move from L.A. to Nashville, his new album Blue Obsession, the
record label he co-founded with Jeff Bridges, and what it's like to return
to the stage with his fellow Doobies.

ANOTHER EXCLUSIVE: IN THE NETRADIO STUDIO WITH RICHARD MARX

Beyond gigantic 80s hits like ""Right Here Waiting"" and ""Hold On to the
Night,"" and the relatively quiet career he's had in the 90s, Richard Marx
continues to be in demand as a producer for artists ranging from Lionel
Ritchie to the latest boy bands. (And he's still so cute!) He also
continues his career as a humble adult-contemporary artist (his new album,
""Days in Avalon,"" was just released on his own label). NetRadio's John
Michaels sat down and talked to Marx about his time at the top of the
charts and his continuing work.

AND YET ANOTHER! IN THE NETRADIO STUDIO WITH CHIP DAVIS

Mannheim Steamroller founder and driving force Chip Davis is among the
pioneers of neo-classical electronic music, and with his independent label
American Gramaphone, he helped give rise to the New Age music phenomenon.
His path to his current post with his Grammy-winning group Mannheim
Steamroller included many sidetracks, from teaching music and writing
advertising jingles. Davis talked to NetRadio programmer Jane Fredericksen
about his impact on the New Age landscape and Manheim Steamroller's huge
holiday success. http://www.netradio.com/features/chipdavis.html

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

1239,"Regulatory Affairs
- The Oregon Public Utility Commission today hosted a public hearing in
Portland to discuss the impacts of PGE's Oct. 1 price increase. The hearing
was conducted in response to a request by consumer and business interest
groups, even though the 11-month long rate case proceedings are officially
closed and the OPUC approved PGE's request. 

Pamela Lesh, PGE's vice president of Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs,
represented the company at the hearing. Representatives and members of the
interest groups - Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities, Associated
Oregon Industries, and Citizens Utility Board - also offered their comments. 

Today's hearing is part of a larger campaign by these groups asking for
reconsideration of PGE's rate case. Several weeks ago, the OPUC denied their
request to block the implementation of new rates on October 1, 2001. A second
proposal by these groups is a request for reconsideration, in which the OPUC
could decide to create a plan to mitigate or defer the price increases over
time. This matter has yet to be decided by the OPUC, but we expect them do
deny the reconsideration request. PGE has stated that a price deferral or
""phase-in"" approach would not be wise, because it would create millions of
dollars in debt that would ultimately cost PGE customers more in the long
term.  Beginning this week, all residential and business customers will
receive a special mailing from PGE that provides details on how customers can
use energy wisely and efficiently.

Retail Loads
We're roughly 145 MW behind (Authorized) UE-115 forecast in the last 7 days
and 135 MW behind (120 MW behind when adjusted for weather) in the last 30
days, due to significantly weak demand by manufacturing customers (though
high-tech held up well) and likely commercial (non-manufacturing) customers. 
You may have heard this morning that the U.S. Industrial Production (Index)
fell for 12 months in a row, worse since WWII.

Power Supply
- This past week we have seen the market continue to creep up slowly.  The
daily electric has strengthened mostly off-peak with a slight strengthening
on-peak, on-peak has traded mostly around $24 to $25 and off-peak has steadily
moved up from $18 to $21.  In the cash electric we have been selling about
100MW on-peak and have stayed out of the off-peak market due to the gas price
following the electric for Beaver's dispatch price.  Daily gas we have seen
the prices move up to $2.45 Sumas and settled around $2.06 for tomorrow.  This
has been moving all around with weather forecasts being part of the driver and
threats of storms.  Term electric had climbed slowly this past week with the
feeling that we reached the bottom, but has settled back down to last week
prices.  Term gas has followed the electric with the prices rising slightly
throughout the week then settling down to last week prices.

Overall everything has been very quiet with everything running full out when
the dispatch is below the market.  We aren't anticipating any major
fluctuation in the coming week that would cause either gas or electric to move
dramatically.  All the plants are available and running smoothly.

- El Paso Seasonal Exchange - Negotiations are in process with El Paso on a
seasonal exchange in which PGE may take up to 50 MW of Dec01 and Jan02 power
in four-hour blocks.  Total energy taken by PGE must be returned in Sep02 in
four-hour blocks of El Paso's choice.  El Paso would like to embed a provision
for ""lending"" - commercial terms are being negotiated.

- Intel Blend and Extend - Initial contact with customer has been made and
terms are being revised, as requested by Intel.  At Intel's first
availability, PGE will meet with them to discuss two products: (1) an ""extend
and blend"" financing of a reduced rate increase and (2) an extend and blend
product with financed rate reduction embedded in a collar.

Human Resources
- With ? day's negotiations, Company and IBEW successfully wrapped up
negotiations for a 5-year agreement for the 15 employees at our Coyote Plant.
This unusual agreement which is IPP-like in its wording was unchanged through
the negotiations process, with a cost-of-living adjustment added plus an
increase in the incentive plan of up to 4%. 

- In PGE's main agreement covering 900 bargaining-unit employees, a third vote
was held Wed., 10/17, with the result 631 employee in favor of the new 3-yr
agreement and 174 opposed.  This is a good contract and it brings our
negotiation process to a conclusion.

Finance
A draft 8-K for PGE is out for final review and approval.  Once this is filed
PGE will be able to move forward on a $250 million bond deal structured as a
fall away first mortgage.   Current issuance date for these bonds is scheduled
for October 31 or November 1.

Enron / Northwest Natural Transaction
- Officers of NWN and PGE will meet next week for 2 days to discuss how we
work together during the approval process and the plan for the integration
activity.

- The regulatory and business people will meet next week (evening meeting
while we are at the management meeting)  to discuss regulatory strategy for
the OPUC filing that will request approval for the transaction.  Paul Kaufman
will be included in the discussion along with Dick Reiten, Mark Dodson, Bruce
Debolt, Peggy Fowler, Jim Piro, and Pamela Lesh.

- Final draft of the offering memo on the senior credit facility for the
financing of the transaction is being circulated for review.  Presentations on
the transaction with the potential lead underwriting banks is being scheduled
for October 29 and 30th.

1243,"We are about to roll out a campaign to increase usage of the Sunrise financial data warehouse and at the same time address some of the reporting initiatives that came out of Rick's offsite in Galveston.  The goals of this effort are:

To promote usage of the financial data warehouse by both accounting and operational personnel, with the goal of training additional users as well as increasing the number of times our users access the warehouse. 

To identify and develop ""best practices"" reports and guidelines for accessing information in both the R/3 system and the data warehouse and to educate users as to the best solution for each reporting need.

To integrate the use of data warehouse reporting with existing SAP capabilities to relieve pressure on the SAP transaction system during peak periods.

As part of the data warehouse usage campaign, we will use various methods to most effectively reach the greatest number of users.  Those methods may include road shows and demos, articles in newsletters and on websites, and more individualized measures such as BU specific workshops and floor help sessions where data warehouse personnel are available to answer questions and help users become more comfortable using the data warehouse.  We want to tailor our campaign to each business unit's differing needs.

As we talk with the users in each group we believe we can gather information about best practices reports that are available and help to share this knowledge enterprise-wide.

In order to achieve these objectives prior to year end, we need your commitment and assistance.  You have been identified as your group's representative (BU advocate) to assist in accomplishing these goals.  Your responsibilities will be:

To assist in setting a strategic direction for improved reporting in each business unit through training, communication, new report development and knowledge sharing.

To provide assistance in the development and implementation of overall communications and training plans for each business unit to effectively reach the widest audience, including evaluation and recommendation of methods to encourage participation.  

To provide input into the development of a forum for knowledge sharing among the business units to encourage more effective use of all available reporting tools and to share ""best practices"" reports.

We expect there will be two meetings per month, and you will be our contact in setting up sessions for your group to communicate information such as best practices and guidelines as to which tools are most effective for which reporting needs.  We will also be asking you to review the listing of essential reports, key metrics and information needs that we have compiled from the Sunrise interviews last November and from the ISC's back-office review, to update this information in preparing the list of best practices reports. 

To thank you for your participation in this process, the Sunrise team will assist each of you in developing a new Business Objects report of your choice - best case, one that would replace a manual spreadsheet or otherwise help your group retrieve and report on data more effectively.

The successful completion of this campaign should result in more effective use of all available reporting tools and promote the development of a core user base to drive future development and improvements in the reporting area.  You as a BU advocate are a critical component to the success of this effort.  Here's the team:

Hi Rod,
 
First of all, I want to thank you for your participation on the Houston Ballet Board of Directors.  I hope that you are enjoying it.  
 
In addition to the table that we buy annually, we are also giving Houston Ballet $15,000.  In an effort to leverage that donation, the ballet is giving us 300 tickets to the Nutcracker matinee performance on Saturday, November 24th (the Saturday following Thanksgiving).  We will use 260 tickets for children involved with area non-profits, who might not have an opportunity to otherwise experience the Nutcracker.  The other 40 will be used for Enron employees who will volunteer to chaperone the children.  At noon of that day, we will have a pizza party at the Wortham with many of the Nutcracker characters walking around, meeting the children and reading to them.  Since you are involved with the ballet, we thought we'd see if you'd like to ask your team if they would like to be the volunteers.  Spouses and children (older than 14) are welcome to help, too!
 
Please let me know if this is something that your team would be interested in!  If so, we will take care of drafting an email to all of them on behalf of you.

Possible topics:

1. What is FERC's accounting position on the Exposure Draft related to Accounting for Certain Activities Related to Property, Plant, and Equipment, and is the FERC going to author a formal comment?

2. With increased emphasis and regulation related to pipeline safety and integrity, it appears that a number of companies in the industry are embarking on significant programs to throughly test their systems. A significant aspect of a program of this nature is smart pigging and hydrostatic testing. What is the FERC's accounting position on possible capitalization of these costs? 

3. Of recent, the FASB has issued new rules, ie., SFAS 142 on Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and SFAS 143  - Asset Retirement Obligations. Is the FERC going to issue regulatory accounting guidance on these new rules?

4. ""GAAP""-""RAP"" differences has for some time been a informal topic of discussion. With increased FASB rulemaking activity this risk may be increasing. Since ""RAP"" is mandated by Federal Law has the FERC have any concerns that pipeline application of ""GAAP"" that may be deemed, at variance to ""RAP"" may also be violation of federal law? (ie., #1 above, and levelized rate making accounting, approved in rate settlements, but not ""approved"" for GAAP)

1256,"still waiting for the formal pubcomps and acqcomps from JPMorgan and SSB.  I spent years in NY doing the math though and spoke to Rod for his help (he had great color).  The answer is 8-10x ebitda.  as an extra check, we put in another multiple for the duke/westcoast deal (approx. 1.7x rate base).  Same answer both times.  EV 2.0-2.3 (with a sales hat maybe 2.5), equity value 1.6-1.8.  I wouldnt push the sales hat too far though, the duration of contracts on this pipeline do not favorably compare to those on most pipelines in general -- in other words, you could be staring at a ""hole"" in '04.  

(Once I get the precise numbers from the bankers, I'll plug them in -- the answer shouldnt change more than 5%).  What's the next step for me?  Want me to forward to muller/jeff golden?

1257,"As you requested the following are my thoughts on the value of Williams' 17.5% GP interest in Northern Border.

Based on the acquisition of the Duke GP interest the value would be $14.5 million.  (We acquired the Duke 32.5% GP interest for $27 million in total consideration.)  This transaction was completed in December, 1998.  Our projections indicated a 17.4% return based on annual common unit distributions growing from  $2.40 per unit to $2.80 per unit by 2001 (we're currently at $3.05).  Also, this transaction arguably included a control premium since our vote at the MLP went to 82.5% (from 50%) and at NBPL went to 57.75% (from 35%).

Distributions to the GP have increased significantly since the Duke acquisition due to the GP promote.  Williams' GP interest receives the following annual distribution:

Common Unit 			GP Equivalent		Williams Annual
Distribution			Unit Distribution		Distribution*

 $2.40				$ 2.40			$  356,770
 $2.80				$ 5.71			$  848,814
 $3.05				$ 9.33			$1,386,942
 $3.30				$13.41			$1,993,450

*Williams' 17.5% interest represents 148,654 equivalent units.

Capitalizing the above annual distribution at NBP's current yield (7.95%) would result in values of $17.4 million (based on NBP distributions of $3.05/unit) and $25.1 million (based on $3.30/unit).  Capitalizing at the common unit yield could be significantly understating the value given the growth potential in the GP cash flow compared to the common unit, e.g. an increase in the common unit distribution of $ 0.25 per unit (8.2%) results in an increase in the GP distribution of $ 4.08 per equivalent unit (43.7%).  Offsetting this factor, however, would be the risk associated with these higher cash flow grow rates.  For example, a decrease in the common unit distribution would have a comparable negative impact to the above analysis.

Bottom line - I think the interest is worth at least $20 million and could probably support a DASH return above 15% at $25 million.

Let me know if you need any more information or analysis.",Williams,"$14.5 million $27 million 2.40 2.80 3.05 5.71 848,814

1259,"If the six directors are Chandler, Cobb, Wiederholt, Geaccone, Keiser, and Concklin and the one VP is Saunders - I agree.  My other directors have little or no relationship to accounting, but may be more similar to some of Sally's people.   What about me?   I would argue that the Directors in some of the groups look to be a fairly important part of the equation, but I don't have a strong feeling one way or the other.    I know we (ETS) do not use the senior director title in accounting because in ETS it is reserved for basically multifunctional roles or jobs that are typically a VP level responsibility (i.e. - in charge of field operations for a company).    I think we have 3-4 in all of ETS.

The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties in due diligence relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and Enron Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:

The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to Enron will carry Enron Corp guaranties.
The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors.
The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and Enron and the rest of it's subsidiaries.

Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between Enron and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

with CORESTAFF's Managed Services Group to manage and administer its
temporary staffing program. This new arrangement is designed to improve
service and quality as well as increase efficiency in meeting Enron's
temporary employment needs. There are many benefits, including a web-based
application which will provide Enron's temporary staffing users with online
ordering, approval and reporting. More details on this system will be coming
soon.

In order to help the Managed Services Group serve you better in the days
ahead, please take a moment now to fill out the profile questions below and
forward your reply to Joseph Marsh at Joseph Marsh/NA/Enron. This
information will not be used for solicitation, but rather to facilitate a
more efficient ordering process.

note that we anticipate no changes for temporary employees currently on
assignment at Enron as we make this transition.  Again, more details on the
Managed Services program and processes will be distributed in the coming
weeks.

As of January 2, the Managed Services account team will be on-site to answer
any questions and handle your temporary employee needs.  They will be
available via e-mail or by calling 713-345-6899.  Please note that the
current process for requesting temporary employees will remain in effect

It is anticipated that Enron will announce later this week, a new ""Employee 
Stock Option Plan"". 

Approximately 45 days ago we analyzed the cost of EOTT's participation in 
this program.  The cost impact was $2.5 - $3.0 for each year over the next 
five years with no provision of supervesting in the event a business group 
was divested during the term of the grant.  Based on these factors, a 
decision was made for EOTT not to participate in the program at this time.

While EOTT employees will not directly receive communications on this 
program, it is possible that the senior leadership group could receive a 
question on EOTT's participation.   We have elected not to send an EOTT 
employee communication about nonparticipation to avoid raising the issue 
where not necessary.

If you receive questions, you may refer the individual to me or answer with 
the appropriate response based on the information in this e-mail.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation and support of this decision.  If 
you have further questions or comments, please advise.",,$2.5 - $3.0,FYI Enron EOTT

before that they get nothing.  There is no employment agreements in place

we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently

Dear Jess,

A mailing to get out the door, corporate videos to 
label and deliver, file drawers jammed so full you 
couldn't pry them open with a crowbar. 

Can you say ""chaos?"" 

Better to say DYMO LabelWriter EL60, the easy way to 
organize your office, and your life.  

This powerful, versatile PC printer is compatible 
with Palm(tm) Desktop. It's also a snap to use.  
Simply access the LabelWriter software through your 
Palm(tm) Desktop to choose from more than 40 
different labels for printing addresses, media, name 
tags and file folders. No more trips to the post 
office-the EL60 even prints Internet postage. You 
can also print addresses and contacts stored in 
Microsoft Word, Outlook, Goldmine, ACT! and CardScan. 

And you won't spend a cent on toner or ink cartridges 
because The EL60 uses thermal print technology.

Attached is a preliminary timeline for working through all of the environmental related issues to deliver the necessary Resource Reports (F-1) for the FERC application.  There will be more details to be fleshed-out in the timeline, but essentially this is what we believe is strategically needed to deliver a complete exhibit.  If we can get the land managing agencies to agree to work early and collaboratively with the FERC Staff on this project, we may be able to get the FERC Staff to commit early resources to the project and cut a month or two off the tail end.  A lot of this success will be accomplished if we can get clearance to get on the land and perform the ground truthing survey work.  John

for

similar to
the draft round-the-clock MW Turndown transactions that we have been 
discussing.
We are proposing to paper these transactions as if the off-peak each month is 
executed
first and then at a later date the on-peak transactions are executed when the 
gas and 
power prices allow us both to make money.  We have also included language in 
the
transaction agreements to allow negative values in the keep whole and revenue 
sharing
formulas to be carried forward to the end of each quarter and included as a 
true-up in
the last payment of each quarter.  Below is a brief description of the other 
changes:

Off-Peak Transaction:

Different physical plant burns for weekdays or weekends & holidays
Baseload resale of gas back to ENA
ENA's balancing capabilities in Canada will level out varying plant burns
ENA's balancing charges, if any, are included in the keep whole formula
No obligation to sell incremental gas supply into Empire ( i.e. No Part II )
Hourly average of the off-peak LBMP's is used in pricing formula

On-Peak Transaction:

On-peak LBMP's is used in pricing formulas
ENA obligation to sell incremental gas supply into Empire under Part II

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX ""1""  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

""Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day.""

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

1385,"CHOOSING A NEW  BATHING SUIT

Apparently a true e-mail a woman wrote to  her friend after shopping for
a bathing suit.

I have just been through the annual pilgrimage of torture and
humiliation known as buying a bathing suit.  When I  was a child in the
1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed
for a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not
so much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and
they did a good job.

Today's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a
figure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she
can either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral
suit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped
from Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill
department store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to
a designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.

What choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and
entered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first
thing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch
material.

The  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to
launch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that
if you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected
from shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a
swipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.

I fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder
strap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!
Eventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a
while to  find the other.

At last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is
that   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant
to wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.

I realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full
view assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it
only fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me
oozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a
lump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.

As I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the
pre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, ""Oh There you
are!"" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so
sure and asked what else she had to show me.

I tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of
masking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an
oversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of
leopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like
Tarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.

I tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in
mourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I
thought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.

Finally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style
bottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and
bulge  friendly, so I bought it.

When I got home, I read the  label which said ""Material may become

transparent in water."" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just
have to stay out of  the water!",Fantasia Jane,,the  maternity department Disney The  Lycra NASA

SUBJECT:

to trade WTI Calendar Swap and SoCal Basis Swap on enymexsm.  As a result, 
the NYMEX ACCESSc strip codes will be changed.

The following STRIP code changes will go into effect on Sunday, March 25th 
for trade date Monday, March 26th:

Commodity Old STRIP Code New STRIP Code
Cinergy              CS              CE
Entergy              NS              NE

The following is a summary of AK Steel's credit related comments:

1. Delete Part 1(g) of the Schedule which amends the Credit Event Upon Merger 
provisions.

2. Delete the reference to ""affiliates"" in setoff.

3. Delete the exclusion of consequential, punitive etc.  damages from the 
Limitation of Liability section.

4. Delete clause (ii) of the definition of Credit Support Amount which refers 
to Independent Amounts.

5. Delete the Material Adverse Change and Potential Event of Default triggers 
from the definition of Threshold.  Delete the concept of Material Adverse 
Change.

6. Change the ""and"" to an ""or"" in the definition of Letter of Credit where it 
refers to the required credit rating for the Issuer.

7. Lengthen the time for delivery of collateral from 2 days to 5 days.

unecessarily broad - it doesn't identify a specific proposed transaction and 
therefore concievably any info. exchanged between the parties will be subject

1415,"Dear Hosts:

The list below sets out the five parties for the May 19 Church Gourmet.  If 
you have trouble finding telephone numbers or e-mail addresses for people, 
please call the church office or e-mail the church office.  Many new members 
are joining us this time, so each party includes one or more persons whose 
information can be found only in the newest church directory.  

Most of the parties include at least one vegetarian.  Please ask your 
parties' vegetarian to make the Maque Choux or Red Beans and Rice.  I suggest 
that the host make the dessert - or that the host ask the maker of the 
dessert to bring his or her own pan to use for flaming stuff.

The Gerhart party is rather small.  Kleta, you may not need to assign all of 
the menu items for your household.  The Hollrahs have requested that they 
bring red beans and rice.  If the Wendtlandts cannot make it, please let me 
know, I have some substitutes in mind.

We have some possible substitutes to call if one or more of your guests 
cannot make the party and gives you sufficient notice.  If a guest calls with 
less than 3 days notice, and you think their excuse is such that they should 
be able to cook even if they can't eat, feel free to ask them to do so.  In 
the event of last minute cancellations, wing it, invite a neighbor or other 
friend and have fun anyway.

Thanks for your help - Laissez Bon Temps Roulez!

Samantha Boyd is a new paralegal in our Group and she will coordinate getting

Monday since you are meeting with Continental Tuesday.

As we discussed, we are incorporating EnronOnline LLC today.  As soon as we 
hear from Deb Korkmas (a paralegal that handles our corporate matters) that 
the company has been incorporated you can tell Continental that they can sign 
the agreement and return it to us via fax (have them fax it to Samantha's 
attention at fax:  (713) 646-3490).  Upon receipt of the fax Samantha will 
get it initialled by Mark Taylor and have it walked to either Louise Kitchen 
or Andy Zipper for signature (depending on who is in).  Either of them can 
sign for all 3 companies, Louise as Managing Director, Andy as Vice 
President.  After the agreement is fully executed Samantha will fax it to 
Rick Wagner at Continental (unless you give her instructions to the contrary).

If the counterparty wants to negotiate the agreement, they will have to talk 
to Mark directly.  His phone no. is 853-3399.

Per our conversation, I am attaching  a sample form of ISDA for both a 
Canadian corporate and a Canadian governmental.  With the governmental, the 
proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be 
modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion).  
As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are 
getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may 
want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any 
governmental guarantor.  If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let 
me know and I'll send you down the revisions.

By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him 
to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto 
for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.  I have to say that if you end up 
transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not 
include the reps and warranties required to transact with such 
counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to 
execution of a master.  If you go down that road we may have to come up with 
some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first.

at Enron and what can be done to make it better.  That's why Enron wants to 
check your pulse.  In fact, we've changed the name of last year's ""Excellence 
Through Communication"" employee survey to The Pulse.  This new name more 
accurately captures the purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis helps us 
correct problem areas so we can continue to make Enron a great place to work.

Starting Monday, October 16, you will be asked to provide input into Enron 
and your work environment.  We would like to have 100% participation across 
Enron, because the only way to make things better is to know where we need to 
make improvements.


Will be available:  Monday, October 16 - Friday, Oct. 27
Will be located at: survey.enron.com

There are a few things you should remember about The Pulse:

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.  You can complete your survey 
at your desk via the intranet at survey.enron.com.  If you prefer, special 
computer kiosks will be available in some of our larger offices and group 
computer terminals will be available in smaller field offices.  We want to 
provide you with the most comfortable environment possible, as your 
participation is of vital importance to Enron.
2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best to 
cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action preventative 
processes that will help identify smaller problems before they become major 
ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are 
collected in the survey -- your active role will help us identify the best 
solutions.

In last year's survey, employees identified several problem areas regarding 
internal communications and we've already acted on many of your 
recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've accomplished or are 
working on in direct response to your input:

* Educational/informational meetings, like Brown Bag Lunches and Executive 
Floor Meetings
* Flex schedules
* Improved PRC process
* Various employee newsletters, like Enside and eBiz

So take a few minutes to check your pulse and tell us what you think and how 
you feel about your job and about Enron.

We look forward to hearing from you.

on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth 
below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to 
exceed $25,000.00.  The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve 
communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services 
and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific 
transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.  Every effort should 
be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become 
standard at ENA.

 1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written 
description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The 
responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve 
such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide 
substantial professional services.

 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised 
written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and 
expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by 
$25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by 
the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee 
before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional 
professional services. 

 3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be 
properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should 
be obtained for each transaction.

1491,"I was informed late last week that EOL is looking to me to determine whether 
U.S. counterparties should be permitted to trade European power products via 
EOL.  According to Edmund Cooper and Tana Jones, the London office is 
deciding whether European counterparties should be permitted to trade U.S. 
power products via EOL.  I believe that this allocation of counterparty 
review responsibility (with regard to power products) should be reversed.  
The legal team for U.S. power is in the best position to determine whether a 
counterparty, domestic or European, has the requisite legal authority to 
trade U.S. power, and I believe that the London office is better positioned 
to determine whether a counterparty, U.S. or other, has the requisite 
authority to trade a European power product.

As we have discussed during the last week, a counterparty must have specific 
federal regulatory authorization in order to trade U.S. power.  I cannot 
identify any foreign counterparties from my lists of federally authorized 
entities and think it highly unlikely that a foreign counterparty will have 
the necessary authority to trade U.S. power.  Jim Fallon has expressly 
instructed me that in the event we do not currently trade U.S. power with a 
counterparty and cannot otherwise confirm that a specific counterparty 
possesses regulatory approval to trade power, a counterparty should NOT be 
permitted to trade U.S. power via EOL.  Accordingly, I return to my initial 
position that except for those foreign counterparties with whom we are 
currently trading over-the-counter (if any), all foreign counterparties 
should be granted read-only access to U.S. power products.  In the event a 
specific counterparty requests access to U.S. power trading, we can examine 
whether that specific party possesses the necessary authority to trade 
power.  

Edmund Cooper and Justin Boyd are reviewing whether a similar bar should 
apply to the trading of European power by U.S. counterparties, and I will 
defer to their judgment on that issue.

1497,"As a follow-up to our conversation in London when you said I should bring to 
your attention any concerns I might have with financial trading issues, the 
following has recently come up as an issue here in Houston (and does so from 
time to time).   We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next 
week.   I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light 
of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark 
Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your 
attention.

 One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every 
financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms.  
The Houston forms are currently located in a ""read-only"" directory.  We need 
to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they 
use the form.  Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use 
creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms 
evolve without  approval.

Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is 
when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap 
agreement they approve.  It counts as a form change, not a negotiation 
change, if you make it in every agreement.

Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily 
accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical 
component of the Fishkin Project).

Thanks for your attention to this.","Edmund Mark

advisable to ask them the following questions:

1. Should the GP be designated as a Specified Entity?  The alternative may be 
to require the GP to sign a Guaranty and then they would become a credit 
support provider.  By making the GP a Specified Entity, they get picked up in 
the cross default, bankruptcy and credit event upon merger provisions.

2. Should there be an additional termination event or event of default that 
gets triggered if the GP fails to be the GP of the limited partnership?

3. Whose financials are they expecting to receive, the GP's or the LP's?

4. If there are financial tests, who do they pertain to, the GP or the LP?

5. How does the LP qualify as an ESP?  Particularly with some of the less 
experienced credit folks who have not had to deal with this issue on the

Here is a brief about the project with Maria Garcia.

Promigas, in partnership with others,  wants to acquire $80 MM TVCable 
company in Mexico.
Promigas's ownership would be 25%, i.e. , 20MM.  10MM of it would come from 
debt.
Enron wants to participate this deal by offer Promigas loan guarantee in 
exchange of call options
on 50% Promigas equity in TVCable.

Following suggestions have been made:

1) get a market quote for the loan guarantee;
    use credit risk model to price the guarantee internally;
    need to speak to Vasant

2) find a comparable company, study the volatility
    using company value histogram from economics model(crystal ball output), 
I can fit a lognormal

3)calcalte the call option value, find braek-even strike.

1559,"Executive Summary:

SB-7X gives Dept. of Water and Resources given legislative authority to 
undertake short-term power purchases with no price cap through Feb.2nd
New legislation (AB-1X and SB-6X) would seek (1) long-term contracts with 5.5 
cent cap and (2) creation of California Power and Conservation Financing 
Authority
The long-term contracts proposed in AB-1X are likely to be subject to 
significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the Feb.2nd expiration of 
SB-7X.
The authority proposed in SB-6X would have bond issuance powers to finance 
new generation capacity and conservation measures
Negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility 
bailout--utilities and state government split over debt obligations of 
utility parents
State borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state 
treasury; SoCal Edison misses more payments
Bush Administration opposes price caps, but is supporting state efforts to 
split PG&E into separate gas and electricity companies in order to assure 
continued gas supply
Absent urgent passage of a bailout plan or an agreement on longer-term 
contracts, utility bankruptcy is still the most likely scenario.

For further information, contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh 
(x39510).

1. Legislation Passes- Short-Term Measures

SB-7X passed the California State Senate easily.  As we said yesterday, the 
bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the 
Department of Water and Resources until February 2nd.  The Department will 
have $400 million available to finance power purchases, but there 
expectations that these costs could easily rise to $1 billion by next week.

AB-1X has evolved into a longer-term solution and in its current form, would 
authorize the Department of Water and Resources to enter into long-term 
contracts (as opposed to the 15 day contracts in SB-7X) to buy power at a 
price cap of 5.5 cents per kw/h.  This legislation is not expected to pass 
today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week 
period covered by SB-7X, when negotiations between generators, the utilities, 
and the state are likely to resume.

2. SB-6X- What Will the State Do With the Bond Authority?

A second piece of legislation currently under consideration --SB 6X--has 
created uncertainty in the markets.  This legislation will create a 
California Power and Conservation Financing Authority with bond issuance 
authority.  The uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address 
the problem of the $12 billion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities.  
The current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such 
as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency. Yet the 
legislation also says ""the authority may issue bonds, exercise power of 
eminent domain, and enter into joint power agreements and buy, own, and sell 
land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project.""  The general 
nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds 
to finance past debts, or using eminent domain or the bond authority to 
finance the utilities as they enter into a Ch.11 proceeding.  While neither 
Davis nor Senate leader Burton are talking about a full $12 billion bailout 
at this point, the idea of using bond money to pay past debts continues to 
circulate in the legislature.

One of the reasons none of the utility creditors have moved to demand 
repayment is that they are being quietly reassured by the Governor's office 
that 
there will be a government-supported debt workout in the near future.

3. Bailout Could Depend on Parents of Utilities Absorbing Losses

The big problem -- and one which have kept the Governor nor the utility 
companies from opting for this solution -- is a massive battle over how much 
of the
 outstanding $12 billion in back debt the holding companies of the two 
utilities will absorb in any restructuring deal. As we have reported, 
something like half 
of that debt is owed by the utilities to their own sister power-generating 
companies within their holding company structure (the partial de-regulation 
allowed the utilities to split into power-generating and power-distributing 
companies so one side of the holding company buys power from the other side) 
-- 
and public opinion polls show overwhelming majorities understand this quite 
well. Davis wants the utility companies to acknowledge the nature of this 
debt, and to absorb some substantial part of the internal debt within their 
corporate structures; we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or 
issue 
bonds to deal with the rest.

As one very senior California political leader explained, getting the utility 
holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves
 is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread 
public outrage about a ""bailout"" of private price-gouging companies with 
taxpayer money. Since 75% of Californians currently blame the utilities and 
the PUC for this crisis (and only 10% blame Davis), this is a crucial
 political stance for the Governor. 

But, of course, absorbing anything like $6 billion in debt would be quite a 
shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power-generating branches
 of the two utilities, and they began spreading the word that they were quite 
willing to accept bankruptcy. Thus by mid-week, both
sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court 
that would be a worst case solution for all sides: The country's economy 
would 
suffer from the resulting credit shock, the Governor's political future would 
suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a 
bankruptcy judge, while most private sector legal authorities believe the 
utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during 
bankruptcy
 procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of 
the debt in the end. In addition, they would most likely face a state 
government 
determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in 
a major way. 

Senator Burton's SB6X legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically 
to make this point quite explicit. It would set up a ""California Power and 
Conservation
 Financing Authority,"" with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent 
domain. It would finance new power plants, and ""consider the feasibility and 
public
 interest of the state acquiring, operating, and maintaining transmission 
facilities currently owned by investor-owned and municipal utilities."" 

As we write this, all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the 
bankruptcy ledge to safe ground, and there is no question the tone has 
shifted 
in the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to ""maybe we've run this thing 
out as far as we can."" But as we have noted, the chance for miscalculation is
 still quite high. There is no solution agreed to at this time, the stand-off 
over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities' 
holding 
company is continuing, and the technical fact of default still makes it 
possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate 
accelerated payment. 

5. Default Update- Thursday

SoCal Edison- $215 million default to California Power Exchange.

After Edison failed to make a $215M electricity payment yesterday, the 
California Power Authority began seizing long-term contacts and reselling 
them to recoup some of the money owed to generators.  PG&E said it expects 
its trading privileges at the Cal. Power Authority to be suspended today, 
leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources.

While the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted PG&E's and SoCal's 
ability to buy power, the Department of Water and Resources will be able to 
pick up some of the slack, at least in the very short-term.

The state itself may be getting into risky credit territory.  The proposed 
California Public Power Authority would borrow in the neighborhood of $1.3 
billion from the state General Fund in advance of this year's expected fiscal 
surplus, with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future 
revenues.  With near-bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes, it is 
unclear where the revenues would come from.  The amount borrowed and terms of 
repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating 
agencies.

5. Bush Policies

As we reported on Wednesday, the Bush Administration continues to demonstrate 
little interest in getting involved in the California crisis.  
President-Elect Bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments, 
which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root 
of the current supply shortage.  Bush and his top officials appear to be 
unanimously opposed to long-term price caps.

However, there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration, 
according to a source close to a top Bush economic advisor.  There is 
significant concern that PG&E's credit problems could cause gas suppliers to 
stop shipments of gas through PG&E's pipeline.   The risk would be that the 
pipeline could ""go dry"", causing significant and possibly dangerous 
disruptions in California residences and businesses.  To prevent this 
problem, Bush is working with Davis on a proposal to split PG&E into separate 
gas and electric companies. The gas company would be solvent, but the 
electric company would go immediately into Ch.11 following significant 
defaults.","Robert Johnston Kristin Walsh

I wanted to continue the analysis on mark-to-market that I had spoken to you 
about on the phone.  

I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction 
by phone, so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vince's group explain the 
transaction to you.

Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India, and he has just 
returned to Houston from India after working with the team here.

He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction.  I would 
like you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion 
please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to 
market.

Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from 
the Indian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may 
need to repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account 
for these maybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there 
will be an Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon 
consolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that 
we would like to have mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through 
Mauritius, and then Caymen Islands.

Another key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the 
US there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, in 
India, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income 
showing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would get 
treated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the 
US.  I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of 
the income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F 
and other concerns).

Finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and 
getting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to 
Indian Corporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type 
of accounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about, 
and will brief you on the same.

Krishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.

Look forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an exciting 
project for us all.

A Measurement Framework for Bank Liquidity  Risk

Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial  Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial  management solutions that 
combine advisory and systems development services to  &corporations and 
financial institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity  risk, as opposed to credit and market risks, has received little 
attention in  professional or academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk  can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some  concepts and definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to  measure a bank's structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the  framework with modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk  VAR measure. The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration  of the liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.

This is an update on the continuing Winston saga. Tanya
identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies
but the rest is in the Winston's hands.

Steve Stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational, Enron-first
approach to the problem. Privately, my concern is that the code, based on 
Tanya's
report to me, leaves a lot to be desired. The code tends to be a very 
mechanical
implementation of the algorithm, developed without a series attempt to 
optimize it.

Let's keep paddling along.

I won't be able to make the call on Monday.

I'd be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team.  It sounds
like there's no shortage of people who want to be on the committee.

My big issue is default service.  This industry needs real customers and
the only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service.
Starting with big customers, along the lines of the core/non-core gas
model, is the best way to go.  The only way to sell this, however, is to
get the big customers to agree it's a good idea.

1648,"Outlined below are some details of the existing curve validation process and 
its application to the proposed validation of tariff curves.

Wholesale Curve Validation

The existing process incorporates validation of all wholesale curves and 
includes monthly validations and random curve reviews. Every month, results 
of the validation are summarized in a memo and distributed to the Senior 
Management. Results of the random curve reviews are brought up to the 
attention of Desk Heads responsible for the respective curves and Senior 
Management as necessary.

Curve Assessment
 Green: 
  - curve is reasonable
  - small P&L impact from curve shift
 Yellow:
  - curve is illiquid
  - medium-to-large position and P&L impact from curve shift
  - some ability to validate prices from external sources
 Red:
   - curve mark is inaccurate (based on external data obtained)
  -  curve is illiquid: no ability to validate externally
  - significant positions and P&L impact from curve shift

Curves that are inaccurately marked based on data obtained from external 
sources are urged by the Senior Management to be corrected. In the cases 
where external data is not available or clear, the Senior Management urges 
the respective Desk Head not to increase an already large illiquid position 
or to built in a risk premium by widening the respective bid/offer spread and 
not to take on positions inside of that spread.

Selection Criteria
The criteria for monthly curve selection are the following:
 P&L sensitivity
 Largest positions
 Staleness (curves have not been marked for a period of time)
 Completeness (curves that have not been validated in a long time)

The main criteria for random curve validation is new deals.

Curve Validation Tools
Broker Quotes/Other external data
Graph Analysis (curve slope vs. a peer group, curve humps/sculpting vs. a 
peer group, curve shift vs. position shift, etc.)
New Deal Analysis (comparison of curve marks and executed/quoted prices)

1656,"Calif. power resources will be 3,752 Mw short in 2001

By David Feliciano, BridgeNews

Scottsdale, Ariz.--Dec. 7--California resources and reserves for
electricity will be 3,752 megawatts short of the anticipated load in 2001,
California Independent System Operator (ISO) President and CEO Terry Winter
said Thursday at the annual Western Systems Coordinating Council meeting.

""I'm concerned about supply,"" Winter said.

""Without sufficient supply, markets will set socially and politically
unacceptable price levels (for wholesale power)""

Winter said California power resources will total 46,679 Mw in 2001, but
load is expected to reach well over 50,000 Mw. Over 17,000 Mw of new 
generation
is planned for the state, but most new power plants are not expected to begin
service until 2002 and beyond.

Not helping California's cause, Winter said, are reduced imports of power
this year from neighboring states, down from 7,500 Mw in November of 1999 to
3,900 Mw this November.

Winter also pointed to the affect of a soaring natural gas market. ""You can
build generation, but in California, natural gas and emissions are the next
problems. Natural gas is running into the same problem electricity has...there
is a shortage.""

Due in part to the above California wholesale power prices have skyrocketed
since May, leading to rolling blackouts in San Francisco in June and a series
of conservation emergencies since that time. The state has been under a power
conservation warning much of this week.

As tools to solve California power woes, Winter suggested the ISO file for
an extension of price cap authority for power until markets are demonstrated 
to
be workably competitive. The ISO's authority to set price caps, which 
currently
stands at $250 per Mw/hour expired Nov. 15. The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission on Nov. 1 proposed caps of $150 Mw/hour, but has yet to officially
rule on the matter.

Winter also called for the California Public Utilities Commission to allow
full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by load.  End

*********************************
California ISO Files Emergency Action With FERC to Deal With Electricity 
Supply Crisis

FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 8, 2000 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
While grappling
with another Stage Two Emergency today, the California Independent
System Operator (California ISO) is taking swift action to deal with a
critical shortage of bids in the ISO market as well as serious
underscheduling of electricity in the forward markets. The proposed
market changes create the incentive to sell power in existing markets
and allow the ISO to compete better for regional energy, which is in
short supply throughout the western United States.

This afternoon, the ISO filed an emergency tariff Amendment 33
filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
Commencing at 3:00 p.m. today Friday, December 8, 2000, the California
ISO will implement a $250 ""soft cap"" on the ISO's Real-Time Energy
Market similar to that proposed by FERC in its November 1 Order
Proposing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets (93 FERC
61,121).

Analogous to the soft cap proposed by FERC, Energy bids prices in
excess of $250/MWh will no longer be rejected by the ISO's
computerized scheduling system but, instead, will be evaluated in
price merit order. The California ISO has recently been placed in the
position of having to negotiate prices for power in real-time and is
finding it increasingly difficult to manage these negotiations while
at the same time balancing supply and demand; causing significant risk
to the California ISO's ability to maintain reliable control of the
power grid. The ISO will no longer negotiate prices in real-time. To
the extent the ISO issues dispatch instructions to Scheduling
Coordinators (market participants) for energy bid prices in excess of
the $250 soft cap, then settlement will be as-bid, subject to refund,
if the costs cannot be verified. Market participants will be required
to submit cost documentation to the FERC, with informational filings
to the ISO and the state, supporting any Energy payments priced in
excess of the soft cap.

The current $250 price cap in Ancillary Service capacity bids is
unaffected. Also, the market clearing prices for Ancillary Services
and Imbalance Energy will continue to be calculated and posted up to
the $250 soft cap.

Amendment 33 proposes three key elements:

1. Implement a ""soft cap"" of $250/MWh for Imbalance Energy. This
soft cap would limit market clearing prices to $250/MWh, but would
allow market participants to submit bids over $250 if they submit
verifiable costs.

2. Allocate the costs for energy purchases above the soft cap to
Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISO's real-time energy
purchases to meet their loads, rather than buying their own supplies
in the forward markets; and

3. Impose penalties on Participating Generators that fail to
comply with ISO dispatch instructions. Amendment 33 is posted on the
ISO's website at www.caiso.com under FERC FILINGS on the home page.

The ISO has seen a dramatic increase in costs for the power it
buys in real time. For the first five days of December we averaged
approximately $5 million per day. However, on December 5th we paid $36
million, December 7th $81 million. Failure to take action now would
have the local utilities and ultimately their customers continue to
face these extraordinary costs.

The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of
electricity along the long-distance, high-voltage power lines that
make up the bulk of California's transmission system. The
not-for-profit public-benefit corporation assumed the responsibility
in March, 1998, when California opened its energy markets to
competition and the state's investor-owned utilities turned their
private transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage.

Federal Agencies Gear Up Hydro System to Meet Demand

PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 8 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Due to an impending power shortage,
federal agencies will increase generation at nearly all of the federal dams.
This may cause some projects to operate outside the limits of the biological
opinion under the Endangered Species Act as additional water is released for
generation from upstream reservoirs, the Bonneville Power Administration said
today.

The announcement came following a call by the Regional Emergency Response
Team and Northwest governors for conservation of electricity when arctic air
invades the Northwest beginning this weekend. The team comprises Northwest
utilities, the Northwest Power Planning Council and representatives of the
four Northwest states.

BPA officials said that this step must be taken in order to ensure that
heavy demand for electricity can be met in the region through next week.
Forecasters are predicting freezing temperatures on both sides of the
Cascades. BPA supplies about 40 percent of the region's electricity, most of
it generated at dams in the Columbia River Basin.

""Utilities in the region have assessed their generating inventories and
determined that the region is clearly short of energy and in an emergency
status,"" Delwiche said. ""The BPA and other utilities must take extraordinary
steps immediately to avoid potentially severe shortages next week.""

Water is stored in reservoirs behind upstream dams and released in the
spring to assist downstream migration of juvenile salmon. BPA manages the
storage to ensure that enough water is available to both meet electrical
generating requirements and flows for salmon. BPA has the authority to exceed
guidelines of the biological opinion under emergency conditions.

""It is very important that everyone - residential and commercial consumers
and industries -- do what they can to cut back on their use of electricity
during this cold snap,"" said Greg Delwiche, BPA's vice president for
generation supply. ""Every kilowatt hour saved now means less need to draw
water from the reservoirs.""

Calif. Restarts Dirty Power Plants

By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Hoping to ease the state's electricity
crisis, air-quality regulators Friday allowed the restart of
several power plants in Southern California that had been shut down
because they had reached air pollution limits.

The move came a day after California encountered an
unprecedented power crunch, with electricity supplies for the
state's 34 million people so perilously low that California only
narrowly avoided blackouts.

The power crunch has been blamed on cold weather in the
Northwest, the shutdown of some generating plants for repairs or
other reasons, and the effects of utility deregulation in
California.

On Thursday, during the emergency, power plants capable of
producing 2,400 megawatts were off-line because they had exceeded
their pollution limits. One megawatt is sufficient to power about
1,000 homes.

On Friday, the South Coast Air Quality Management District
agreed to let some of those polluting power plants return to
operation and restore about half of that lost generating capacity.
However, those plants will have to pay daily fines.

Restarting the over-polluting plants should provide a cushion
for state, said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the
California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's
power grid.

In addition, hundreds of companies voluntarily cut consumption
Friday to avoid imposed outages.

``We're still encouraging conservation efforts,'' said Lori
O'Donley, spokeswoman for the ISO. ``We're optimistic that we won't
have to'' impose shutdowns on commercial customers.

Federal energy regulators are working with the state to find
power that can be diverted to California during the crunch, moves
that could include increasing hydroelectric generation out of
state.

The power grid's managers were able to avoid blackouts Thursday
by shutting down the enormous state and federal pumps that push
water from Northern California to central and southern regions.

The phased-in deregulation of California's $20 billion
electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by creating
greater competition. But demand for electricity has outstripped
supply, in part because of a growing population and a booming
high-tech economy.

Electricity is also in short supply because energy companies
held off building new power plants while deregulation was in the
planning stages. In addition, deregulation has forced utilities to
sell off their power-generating assets, such as dams and plants,
and import electricity from neighboring states, where power demand
is high right now because of a cold snap.","David Feliciano Terry Winter

 I contacted Cheryl Dawson the environmental manager at Enron Methanol 
regarding the Corporate Watch article.  As you can see below in Cheryl's 
response the emissions reported to EPA under the Toxic Release Inventory 
(TRI) rules  have decreased significantly since the 1997 report developed by 
Environmental Defense.  Additionally, Cheryl related to me that Enron 
Methanol was a participant in Clean Texas 200, an effort to reduce the amount 
of waste being generated annually by 50% by the year 2000.  Enron Methanol 
did achieve this goal, and has gone from a large quantity waste generator to 
a conditionally exempt small quantity generator.  This is due to the 
beneficial use by the Enron  MTBE plant of the mixed alcohol by -product from 
the Methanol plant.  In 1998 , MTBE plant began using the mixed alcohols in 
their process stream.  That is certainly a success story and is reflected in 
the reduced n-butyl alcohol TRI entry seen in Cheryl's note below.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Interested Clients
FROM: John & Hengerer
RE: Commission Meeting -- July 12, 2000

At today's Commission meeting, the Commissioners approved the consent agenda 
and then discussed the following items.

 ELECTRIC MATTERS

Order Nos. 888 and 889
Chairman Hoecker announced the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision 
affirming the Commission's Order Nos. 888 and 889.  In its decision, the 
Court affirmed the open access principles and stated that public utilities 
must provide access to their transmission lines to purchasers and sellers of 
electricity in the interstate market.  While congratulating the Staff for a 
job well done, Chairman Hoecker also noted that these orders are only a first 
step with the next step being Order No. 2000, which is targeted at making the 
national grid available on fairer terms and more efficient for all 
transmission users.  He also added that functional unbundling has proven to 
be inadequate, and that a voluntary regime for reliability is not compatible 
with a competitive market.  Finally, he addressed the lack of investment in 
transmission and generation  and that he expressed hope that there will be 
federal legislation addressing jurisdictional transmission issues.  
Commissioner Massey noted that the Court affirmed a mandatory open access 
approach, thus translating well for a move to a similar mandatory approach 
for RTO policy.  

Open Access Same-Time Information System (OASIS) Phase II, Docket No. RM00-10
Today, the Commission issued, with Commissioner Hebert concurring, an 
advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to begin the development of OASIS, 
Phase II.  By February 15, 2001, interested parties are asked to file 
detailed standards for communication protocols and business practices for 
transmission providers and customers to reserve and schedule transmission.  
The standards are expected to be in operation by December 15, 2001, to 
coincide with the date RTOs are to become operational.  This proceeding is 
considered to be part of a continuing evolution of OASIS in order to account 
for e-commerce and the development of RTOs, while also addressing the need 
for fewer seams among regions, increased communications across regions, and 
an increase in functionality via uniformity.  The Commissioners urged the 
industry to develop an industry consensus in order to allow for an expedited 
implementation process.  

However, in his concurrence, Commissioner Hebert expressed concern that this 
proceeding is unnecessary and/or a distraction to competition and to viable, 
stand-alone transmission entities.  Commissioner Hebert believes that this 
implementation issue already is covered by Order No. 2000's recognition of 
the need for interregion coordination and deeming the RTO as the OASIS 
administrator.  Thus, according to Commissioner Hebert, OASIS Phase II is a A

You may find this presentation about the Cuiaba story interesting .  I 
developed it March 99 as a training tool for our new developers.  It took me 
through December 99 to negotiate the remaining PPA indexation issues.  There 
are two embedded Word files in the document (Sept 97 logs). From your 
perspective,  you can subtitle it  ""make up the regulation on-the-go"". Such 
is life in the developing world. When you read the log you will see that 
under the circumstances, you always have one foot in and another out (getting 
ready to terminate) 

Rick Lammers is still continuing to close financing but facing other issues. 
Primarily,  1) construction delays in the pipeline due to governmental 
interference with the route (after getting construction license), 2) 
technical problems with the Siemens turbines, 3) getting consent documents 
out of the public entity bureaucracy, 4) getting the Central Bank to clarify 
the US$ account regulations for the project.

",Jim,,FYI
1662,"Re:  the speech.

(1) Both the Governor and Steve Reynolds thanked us for the speech and stated 
that it was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to 
speak.  The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in 
energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders.

(2) I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorp's reaction to the notion 
that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs 
(at the retail level).  Another representative for one of the coal concerns 
made the same comment.  These comments took us towards a discussion of what 
went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity.  

I partly agreed with PacifiCorp--i.e., I agreed that we were in a state of 
transition in the wholesale and retail markets.  I also pointed out that:  
(1) we couldn't look at California and reach any conclusion other than they 
messed up; (2) we didn't have an entirely free market in electricity in the 
West--i.e., it's a hybrid of regulation, etc.; and (3) that the model 
discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity (a point 
that the Gov. also made).  I said that it applies to wholesale electric 
markets in some areas, coal markets, gas markets, and that the model applies 
in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated.  

I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling, restructuring 
etc., because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to 
maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming.  The Governor on a number 
of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction (i.e., away from 
retail).  

(3) Nancy Vanderberg (El Paso--a former Enron employee) sends her regards.  
She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming.  
I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers.  

(4) The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from 
competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill 
off smaller local competitors.  I responded with the usual--make sure no 
barriers to entry, when the price gets high enough competitors will take on 
WalMart, etc.

(5) Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately.  
In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on 
RTOs, ensuring that all customers are treated the same, etc.  The Gov. gave a 
number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West, etc.

(6) The Gov. mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy 
resources available to producers in Wyoming.   He also pointed out 
deficiencies in Wyoming-East connections on both gas and electric as well as 
deficiencies in Wyoming-Calfornia pipeline constraints.  


A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne (FYI)

(7) The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission (Steve 
Reynolds) are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron.  I 
affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be 
contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient.

(8)  These guys are serious and dedicated.  The Commission was given a $1 
million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on 
behalf of the state.  During the meeting the Commission approved a series of 
additional meetings, working groups and advisory committees.  Sue Landwehr 
and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the 
meetings, working groups, etc.

(9) My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor 
and the Governor's staff are familiar with how commodity markets 
work--particularly ag products.  They understand the concept of basis and 
also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is 
adequate transmission capacity, gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity.  
They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission 
system (a complete constraint moving east, off-peak constraints moving north, 
south, and west), limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline 
serving the state (Kern--perhaps due to downstream constraints), and some 
problems with the cost of rail transportation (if not a constraint).  While 
they have a working understanding of all these things, they haven't been able 
to put it all together in a cohesive way.  

(10) Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west (and the rest of the 
country), but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent 
state.  (For example, the state moved from a $250 million deficit in FY 1999 
to an approximately $750 million surplus in FY 2000).  They also want to 
diversify the state's economy and bring economic development.  For example, a 
major focus of the state's Business Council has been to recruit ""server 
farms""--because of their load and high load factors.  They talked about 
co-locating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state 
(which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available). 

(11) The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging.  In his 
comments to the Commission, PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the 
state should clarify the utility's responsibility to either:  (1) build their 
own power plants; or (2) acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge.  Steve 
talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how 
the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in 
2000/2001--because the generation acted as a hedge against market prices.  
Steve was also supportive of gas restructuring at the retail level--but 
silent on electric restructuring.","Steve Reynolds Nancy Vanderberg Steve

Energy Boss Says State Summer Blackouts 'Appear Inevitable' 
Carolyn Lochhead, Chronicle Washington Bureau
Friday, March 16, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/16/MN20
0965.DTL 
Washington -- The Bush administration warned yesterday that blackouts ""appear 
inevitable"" in California this summer, but it firmly rebuffed a deal from 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein that would force the state to lift its rate freeze on 
consumers in exchange for federal controls on wholesale prices. 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham insisted that price controls would make 
shortages worse by reducing power sales into the state. The administration's 
top priority is to prevent blackouts, he said. 
""Let me make one point clear,"" Abraham told the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee. ""Any action we take must either help increase supply or 
reduce demand. . . . Price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand. In 
fact, in our view, they will seriously aggravate the supply crisis."" 
Abraham said electricity shortages in California ""will get worse, and 
blackouts this summer appear inevitable."" He cited projections of anywhere 
from 20 to 200 hours of rolling outages this summer. 
""I'm not saying that people in California don't want lower energy costs,"" he 
said. ""But I know for sure they don't want to be sitting this summer without 
electricity at all. And our goal is to try to avoid that as the primary 
public interest responsibility of this administration."" 
Feinstein became the first leading state Democrat to break with Gov. Gray 
Davis in calling for an end to the rate freeze that has kept electricity 
prices low for California consumers, even as soaring wholesale costs have 
driven the state's investor-owned utilities to bankruptcy and now are 
draining the state's budget surplus. 
But Feinstein insisted that the federal government must simultaneously force 
down wholesale prices until ample new power plants come online. 
Feinstein said higher consumer rates would encourage conservation, saying 
that if people just turned off their computers at night, they would save 7 
percent of the state's electricity supply. 
She also said the state, which now is buying electricity for the utilities, 
has already run through $2.7 billion and could spend $10 billion on 
electricity this year. 
""That is gone,"" Feinstein said. ""It doesn't buy a school. It doesn't repair a 
road. It doesn't build the water system many of us believe the state needs."" 
The offer came as a compromise with Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith, who 
warned that an ""economic and environmental catastrophe"" awaits the Western 
states this summer when electricity demand is expected to soar while a 
drought in the Northwest constricts the supply of hydroelectric power. 
Smith's move to embrace price controls, which he had earlier rejected, 
reflected sharply intensifying political pressure on the Bush administration 
to intervene in the electricity market, as Western officials complained 
bitterly yesterday that rising energy prices are forcing layoffs and now 
threaten the region's economy. 
LESSONS OF SUPPLY, DEMAND
""I'm afraid this summer we're going to be in the middle of a dry lakebed 
explaining to very angry farmers and homeowners and former factory workers 
the lessons of supply and demand,"" said Smith, whose family owns a frozen 
vegetables business. ""I don't want to send the wrong signals to the 
marketplace . . . but I'll tell you, the wrong signal is a recession."" 
Abraham repeatedly sought to counter criticism that the Bush administration 
is not doing enough to aid the West, citing a letter he sent to Davis 
yesterday that said the White House will not oppose the state's plan to take 
over the investor-owned utilities' transmission lines, despite disagreeing 
with the approach. 
""Regrettably, I think our opposition to price caps has been claimed by some 
to suggest that the administration either does not care about California and 
the West or is doing nothing to help,"" Abraham said. ""That is simply untrue."" 
Abraham said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's recent order to 13 
power suppliers to refund $69 million in January overcharges to the utilities 
would send ""a signal that companies that exploit a serious situation aren't 
going to get away with it."" 
He also cited expedited federal approvals and waivers for power plants and 
discussions with Mexico to try to increase electricity exports from Baja to 
California. 
But Abraham firmly rejected price caps, saying they ""have already been tried 
and already failed"" in California when a price ceiling for electricity sales 
into the state was reduced over the past year from $750 a megawatt hour to 
$150. 
RESULTS OF PRICE CAPS
""The lower the price cap was set, the higher average electricity prices 
rose,"" Abraham said, in part because municipal utilities were exempt. New 
federal price caps would affect just half of the Western electricity market, 
he said, and so would shift supplies from regulated to unregulated markets 
rather than control prices. 
He also said price caps would ""almost certainly"" reduce sales from Mexico and 
Canada and induce ""cheating and circumvention."" 
Armed with charts showing huge wholesale price increases over the past year, 
Feinstein expressed her strong disappointment. 
""Oh, Mr. Secretary,"" Feinstein said, ""I was really surprised by the ideologic 
hardness of your statement. I must tell you that."" 
She said California will be 5,000 megawatts short of electricity this summer, 
enough power for 5 million homes. ""It's a lot of shortness,"" she said, 
predicting that prices will reach $5,000 a megawatt hour. ""What does 
California do about that if it isn't going to get any help to provide that 
stability and reliability over that period of time? . . . All we're asking 
for is help to prevent price-gouging."" 
Abraham countered that the administration's position is ""common sense."" 
""I'm telling you, I think this summer, if California has worse blackouts than 
currently projected, that (price caps) would have been a disservice to the 
people of your state,"" Abraham said. ""If the rest of the West finds the 
Canadian energy providers refusing to sell at the same levels because of 
price caps . . . that's in my judgment an irresponsible carrying out of our 
public responsibilities here."" 
In Sacramento, Davis said he was ""particularly grateful"" for the 
administration's promise not to oppose the state transmission takeover. He 
also said the state would ""have just enough power to avoid blackouts"" but 
said ""federal officials are of a different view."" 
Still, the governor continued to urge ''some effort to temper wholesale 
prices.""

delivers it to Parliament.  Turkish fuel consumption tax, I believe, was 
modified without prior notice.  In Romania, Doug Wood met with the Energy 
Minister on the proposed Gas Decree, and 2 days later they passed another 
draft of the decree, which had been rejected before Christmas, verbatim.  Tom 
Briggs can tell you that the annual revenue formula for BG TransCo, which 
affects all of our UK assets, can swing up or down by 10% per annum, and 
cannot be predicted/modelled (we and our consultants have tried).  Decisions 
by Polish regulator to price regulate generation in Poland, notwithstanding 
our PPA, was another example.  The list goes on.  I remain a sceptic that all 
of these risks, or even many of them, can be ""identified"" a priori.  Once we 
fact them, we do assess/mitigate.  In Europe, I think we accept these as 
""business"" risks, that the regulatory team responds to.   mcs

don't think we need the DC grass tops component.  we have an effective set of 
messages, contacts, consultants and lawyers.  Perhaps we could use Charlie as 
a fresh set of eyes on that stuff, but I think that asking him to develop 
such an effort would be duplicative of what we have done with AAE, Paxson,

I do think the other aspects of what he proposes would be useful, however,

First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.  Schedule i=

very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this=

morning, with some back-up info that I've included below.

Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f=
or=20
delivery to Sen. Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:

I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would=

be appreciated.
As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on=20
Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to ""wallpaper"" Sacramento wi=

our proposed legislation.
This email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the ""final"" version=
s=20
of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I=20
believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.
You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver =
to=20
his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on=20
Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed=
=20
legislation to the rest of the world at the same time.
When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would=20
determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same=
=20
time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will=
=20
handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom=
=20
you've decided to circulate.
This email does, however, include a ""summary"" of our proposed legislation. =
=20
But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the=20
appropriate language to distribute ""to the world,"" or if we'll need instead=
=20
to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a ""one=20
pager"" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the=
=20
package effectively.
We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our=20
proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team coul=
d=20
propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the=
=20
Direct Access coalition?
We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the =
PR=20
machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our=20
legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we=
=20
can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted=
=20
Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.
You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR=

credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.=
 =20
You note that attached to the email is a ""legislative fix"" to AB1X that cou=

The release would be made following a meeting with the governor, if he is not willing to pursue our settlement proposal.  The press release is necessary to explain our reasons for terminating and favorably position us in this controversy.  ABA is operating at a loss (including cash flow) and Azurix management believes that absent a settlement, termination and international arbitration is the only acceptable alternative.

As background, yesterday afternoon the board of ABA voted to terminate the concession contract, unless a settlement is promptly reached with the provincial governor.  The union representative on the board abstained, but information on anticipated termination was leaked to the press and there has been some Argentine coverage today.  DowJones and Bloomberg are aware of this coverage and we are attempting to defer their coverage.  Attached for your information are the Q&As we intend to use in responding to media inquiries.

1686,"STEVE: I very much appreciate your call the day before yesterday and your
asking if I would like to compete to succeed Joe Hillings as head of Enron's
Washington office. Although until that moment I hadn't thought of returning
to Washington except to serve again in national office, I would be pleased
to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter.

In recalling our conversation, I realize that twice you asked if I had any
questions, and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer, I would
have asked how government relations are handled at Enron. To whom does Joe
Hillings report: to you or to Terry Thorne? You mentioned a woman who
currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some
neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron; to whom does she
report? Then there is Joe Allen, whom I have known since our days in the
Legislature; doesn't he (also) handle Texas affairs?

I am sorry I didn't ask you all this on Tuesday. Whatever the answers, it's
clear that government relations are  much more central to the work of Enron
than at Compaq, which is why it would be a very exciting place to work.
Thanks again for your call, your courtesy, and your indulgence with this
tardy line of questioning. With best wishes, CHASE.

Below is a summary of the major problems which occurred the past 96 hours and 
the steps taken to mitigate the damage and risk.

Enron Center North (1400 Smith)

As a result of the flooding downtown, approximately six skyscrapers had their 
electrical vaults flooded and began to cause cascading problemd in the 
electrical grid downtown. The net result was the loss of one of the two 35kv 
circuits which serve 1400 Smith. We (engineers, EES Maint, electrical subs)  
believe at the time the circuits blew we shifted from three phase to single 
phase power, which caused an imbalance in the load to the building. 

Consequently, UPS ""C"" which serves a portion of the Lv 34 Data Ctr, the Rolm 
phone switch, and a protion of the Traders floors lost a circuitboard, and 
blew two internal fuses. This power degradation caused PDU ""S"" on Lv 34 to 
trip its main breaker and shutdown power load to servers and equipment on 
this PDU. This occurred shortly after Noon on Saturday.

Response/Restoration

> UPS ""D"" transferred load from UPS ""C"" as the N+1 back up and carried the 
full load of the UPS loss as designed
> EPSC/electrical sub (Henderson Electric); EES Maint; IT worked together to 
power down systems to begin repair work by 4:00pm Saturday
> EPSC/EES Maint coordinated with Pillar/Henderson Elec to obtain replacement 
parts and begin the repairs. By 9:30pm all repairs to UPS""C"" had been made 
and the system bought back on line. As a measure of extra protection the back 
up genset for Enron Ctr North  was in operation
> Reliant Energy restored the circuit at approximately 10:30pm Saturday 
evening
> EPSC/EES Maint and subs conducted a thorough review of all electrical and 
back up systems Saturday evening
> Enron Network IT Operations began restoration of all affected systems 
Saturday evening
> EPSC/EES Maint obtained diesel fuel and topped off all gensets Saturday in 
case of additional problems and due to fuel consumption during the outage

Other Building damage was limited to flooding in the tunnels, and water 
damage/flooding to portions of the Body Shop on Lv B-1

Enron Center South (1500 Louisiana)

Impact/Damage Summary

> Levels 8 & 9  received very limited amounts of water from the core area 
elevator shafts and exterior curtainwall. There was no exposure to water on 
any systems or network cabling during the entire period. (Response) Crews 
contained and cleaned all water as it traced into the building.
> ALL IDF closets on Lvs 3-5 Traders Floors remained dry throughout the 
duration of the rains/flooding on Friday & Saturday
> Lv 6 received some water from Lv 7. (Response) The area was contained and 
cleaned. No additional damage beyond Tuesday evenings flooding occurred
> Due to extreme street flooding and water pressure, a 10"" sanitary sewer 
line tied into ECS burst on Friday evening causing extensive flooding of Lv  
B-1 area (approximately 4-6 inches of water in the basement. (Response)  
Clark & Way Engr was able to install a temporary plug in the line to stop the 
on going flood waters from penetrating the basement. Clean up has continued 
throughout the weekend   
> Due to the extreme flooding and water pressure, the water seal of the 
Reliant Vault burst early Saturday and flooded the electrical vault room with 
24-30"" of water. This resulted in a complete loss of power at approximately 
1:30pm on Staurday afternoon. The back up systems engaged and operated per 
design to support the Data Ctr and Traders Floors. The temporary cooling 
tower went off line. Prior to the flooding Clark had been in the process of 
tieing in the temporary feed into the back up system by 7-1-01 in prep for 
the migration (Response) 
 * Clark used back up water pumps to pump out and clean the Reliant 
electrical vault, as well as maintained operation of the back up systems
 * The Data Ctr AHU's were kept on line with the dehumidifiers/blowers to 
modulate the airflow in the Data Ctr. EPSC had Way Engr techs use 
temp/humidity probes
    to monitor the areas. The recordings indicated temps on Lvs 8 & 9 did not 
exceed 78 degrees and relative humidity did not exceed 68% during the outage
 * Clark/Fisk Elec/EPSC coordinated desing efforts and obtained gear on an 
emergency basis and completed the tie in off the temporary coolong tower to 
the 
    generators by 10:30pm
 * Reliant Energy is still cleaning and replacing gear in th vault room. 
Presntly (AT 11:00PM Sunday) we have one circuit operational in the building 
and 50% of the
              Reliant  gear on line). We are still operating all systems 
safely on the back up sytems for the past 36 hours. It is expected Relaint 
will be complete by 7:00am.
   Clark; the engineers and MEP subs shall be conducting a thorough system 
review and repirs as required of all systems throughout the building during 
the coming
   week.

In summary, the back up systems in both facilities did engage and operate as 
designed; however, due to the extreme conditons and stress placed upon the 
systems the facility held up extremely well. I would also like to note 
throughout the ordeal beginning Friday evening through Sunday, everyone 
(Enron NetWorks;EES FacilitiesClark Const;Way Engring;Fisk Electric;Henderson 
Electric; KW-Pillar;Hines) did an outstanding job under enourmous pressure 
and the most severe conditions I have seen in downtown Houston. 
Communication, around the clock work  and cool heads managed to assess damage 
and develop action/restoration plans to facilitate repairs for Monday business

Dear Callum,
I much enjoyed chatting with you in Aspen: it is always a relief to meet
a regulator who tries to get the process right, and then lets the chips fall
where they may.
In its efforts to remain open to new ideas, Enron has established an
advisory council consisting of academics, business people, political gurus
and the like (Irwin Stelzer is a member). This council meets twice a year
with Enron executives. Our next meeting is scheduled for October 31 at our
London headquarters ( we have a dinner the previous evening, at which we
review the state of political play around the world; you might find it
interesting).
One of the suggestions at the Aspen meeting was that traditional
regulation of energy markets might usefully give way to, or at least learn
some lessons from, financial regulation. Since you are one of the few
regulators who has had experience both in financial markets and in utility
regulation, we are hoping that you might be willing to share some ideas with
us on this subject. A 30-minute talk followed by what I promise will be a
very lively discussion would be perfect from our point of view.
We know how pressed you are for time, but are hoping you will favor us
with your thoughts on this interesting and difficult subject.

1695,"Steve,

After the Napa meeting last December, I headed up a  working group to look at 
coordinating EBS issues Internationally.  Initially I spoke with most of the 
people who signed up for the group, and began gathering comments and 
suggestions for improved coordination.   However, much of the need for a 
working group was reduced for two reasons; first, the addition of Donald 
Lassere provided a person within our group to focus exclusively on 
international coordination, and secondly, the Global Public Affairs 
reorganizations this year solved many of the jurisdictional questions that 
were highlighted by many in my working group.  After the re-org, we saw 
little reason to continue the working group.  

The group did serve as a good sounding board for people to comment on 
communications strategies and  better coordination within Government/Public 
Affairs.  Many of these strategies (particularly more relationship building 
internally) were implemented.  Additionally, the experience was a good one 
simply because it offered an opportunity to better educate other group 
members on EBS and telecommunications in general.

I would not recommend re-forming the group at this time.  I think many of the 
goals the group was initially formed for are actually being achieved now 
through better organizational structures and closer collaboration between EBS 
support personnel and International group members.

Many of the EBS related topics that deserve a collaborative, cross-functional 
process are being examined through informal, ad-hoc working groups now.  For 
instance, based on concerns raised at a recent EBS/Government Affairs 
off-site, we now have an international regulatory/tax/legal working group.  
This group is comprised of participants from Rick Shapiro's group, Mark 
Schroeder's group and EBS commercial support organizations.    

I am a little unclear on what personal feedback you want on group members.  
Please advise what format I should address this in, since I am not a reviewer 
for almost anyone who was in my group.  Suffice to say, everyone was helpful 
during the brief time the working group was in effect.   But I can give more 
detail on individuals if you would like.

Thanks for the opportunity to lead a working group (even for such a short 
time!) and please let me know if I can provide any additional information.  

Best, Scott

PROPOSED ACTION STEPS AGREED TO AT DENVER EMERGENCY MEETING ON DECEMBER 20, 
2000 

1. Action in California. The governors call upon California to redouble its 
efforts to conserve electricity and to stabilize prices and its electric 
power market. 

2. FERC Investigation. The governors thank Chairman Hoecker for his offer of 
assistance and ask that his staff prepare an immediate report on the
implications and potential consequences of regional price caps and bilateral 
contracts, and to investigate: why Western electricity prices have been so 
high; who
has benefitted from these high prices; and whether generating capacity has 
been held back. This information will be useful whatever the individual 
governors
views on these matters. 

3. Energy Conservation. The governors commit to and ask their western 
gubernatorial colleagues to join them in implementing a coordinated, 
state-by-state,
voluntary conservation strategy to free up electricity in the West starting 
no later than January 1. This plan would encourage consumers at every scale 
to reduce
or reschedule electricity demand and would encourage state public service 
commissions to review and adopt other steps such as mechanisms to pay users 
for
forgoing power during times of high demand. Furthermore, the governors agree 
and ask their western gubernatorial colleagues to join them in reducing the
electricity consumed by public agencies in their states. The states will 
coordinate an energy conservation response by December 28. 

4. Presidential Task Force. The governors call upon their colleague 
President-elect Bush to convene a formal team to work with the western 
governors on
this urgent issue while waiting for appointments to be made. 

5. Increasing Supply. The governors will convene in late January or early 
February a meeting of all the affected parties to prepare a vision and action 
plan for
the west's energy future and its relation to a national energy policy, 
including increasing the supply and availability of electricity and energy 
throughout the region
today and in the future. The governors called for this meeting at the winter 
2000 meeting of the Western Governors' Association; due to the current energy
crisis they have fast-tracked this meeting and the development of a 
hemispheric energy policy. ",Hoecker Bush,,WAPA WPTF FERC Investigation Presidential Task Force the Western Governors' Association

1701,"Hi Laura:  I've attached three things, but first wanted to give you a bit of 
an update on events transpiring in Sacramento and at the Public Utilities 
Commission.  

Move to Prohibit Customer Choice
As you may know, AB1X, the bill that the Legislature recently passed and the 
Governor signed, gives the California Department of Water Resources the 
authority to buy power on behalf of the utilities.  Included in that bill, 
however, is a provision that prohibits ""Direct Access,""  California's term 
for customer choice.  

In sum, the bill, in its current form, prohibits businesses and consumers 
from chosing an alternative energy service provider, like Enron.  Our 
understanding is that the Department of Finance called for the prohibition.  
Their reasoning is that they need a ""captive"" customer base to pay for the 
bonds that the State will issue in order to finance DWR's power purchases.

Customer choice was of course the foundation of California's restructuring 
law, AB 1890, and is arguably the only bright spot in an otherwise fatally 
flawed plan.  For example, the only businesses and consumers that were 
protected in San Diego when rates were deregulated last year were those 
businesses and consumers that had signed fixed price power deals with 
competitive service providers.  Ironically, the recently passed legislation 
takes choices away from consumers and diminishes their ability to manage 
their energy costs.  Before AB 1890, consumers and businesses had one 
choice--the monopoly  utility.  With the passage of AB 1X, they again will 
have one choice. But this time their only choice will be to buy from a 
government agency DWR.

A broad coalition of consumer groups has expressed its opposition to the 
prohibition and Senator Debra Bowen (a key player on the Senate side), and 
Fred Keeley (a key player on the Assembly side), have promised to ""fix"" the 
prohibition in another bill ""SB27X.""  I'll forward in another email the 
language that the coalition has drafted and hopes Bowen and Keeley will carry.

Unfortunately, we are now hearing rumors that the Governor intends to direct 
the California Public Utilities to immediately implement the provisions of 
AB1X prohibiting Direct Access, despite the fact that a large coalition of 
consumers and service providers are actively working with Bown and Keeley to 
amend the prohibition language.

It would be extremely useful if the folks participating in the meeting on 
Thursday with the Governor let him know that taking choices away from 
businesses and customers is the wrong way to go and that he and the 
legislative leaders need to work with the coalition to fix it.  You'll note 
in the language developed by the coalition that the proposal strikes a 
reasonable balance between the Dept of Finance's concerns about recouping 
DWR's costs of buying power, and the need to give consumers and businesses 
maximum flexible in managing their energy costs.

Move to Have the State Take Over the Electric Industry in California

John Burton, the Democratic leader of the Senate, insists that, ""if 
California is going to 'bail out' the utilities, the State needs to get 
something in return.""  Burton wants the state to buy and operate PG&E's and 
Edison's transmission system and create a state power authority that would 
get in the business of (among other things) developing, financing, 
constructing and operating power plants and natural gas pipelines.  Burton 
got both of these bills designed to take over the industry passd out of his 
committee yesterday (SB6X and SB33X).  It is unclear how much support he has 
in the full Senate or in the Assembly, but the possibility of passage is 
certainly greater than zero at this juncture.

Others experts are offering a better alternative.  When the federal 
government helped Chrysler out of its financial difficulties 20 years ago, 
the federal government received stock warrants in return.  Until recently, 
the Governor favored warrants, but more recently he has waivered in his 
statements regarding a state take over.  Burton appears to have negotiating 
leverage with the Governor and appears to be using it.

Again, it would be extremely useful for folks to let the Govenor know in the 
meetings on Thursday that a State take over of the industry is an extreme 
move and bad public policy.  I will forward to you in a separate email 
letters that we sent to Burton expressing our opposition to his bills and the 
reasons for our opposition.  In brief, there is no shortage of private 
capital ready and willing to invest in California's energy infrastructure 
(i.e., power plants, electric transmission lines, gas pipelines).  All 
California needs to do is create the investment climate necessary to attract 
the capital.  In addition, history shows that the State is extremely 
ill-equipped to become California's mega-utility. 

Here are the attachments:

A demand buy-down proposal.  We made this proposal to the Governor (and 
continue to propose it to policymakers in Sacramento, Washington D.C. and 
just about everywhere else).  In short, the notion is that, if the market is 
willing to pay power producers, say, 7 cents/kwh to ""produce"" power, then the 
market ought to be willing to pay businesses and consumers 7 cents/kwh to 
""reduce"" power consumption.  

This approach is critical for two reasons:  first, it provides businesses and 
consumers the financial incentives necessary (and that California currently 
lacks) to conserve energy and use energy more efficiently.  Second, because 
California delayed identifying and implementing a solution to California's 
energy crisis, its options for addressing the severe shortages that are 
likely occur this summer are very limited.  Reducing demand represents one of 
the few options that can help to immediately reduce the gap between supply 
and demand.  Putting financial incentives in place now to reduce demand and 
""free up"" electrons is an investment with significant payback.

A ""manifesto"" recently released by a group of Berkeley and Stanford 
economists and industry experts urging the Govenor to pursue a 
""market-oriented"" solution to California's energy crisis.

An editorial in yesterday's Wall Street Journal by Dan McFadden, a nobel 
prize-winning economist from Berkeley echoing the proposal advanced in the 
""manifesto.""  McFadden was one of the manifesto's signatories.

Finally, we are working on ""model Legislation"" proposing a market-based 
solution that we will share with you soon and that we hope the business 
community--and the Valley in particular--can embrace and advocate.

I realize that this is a lot of information and I apologize for the length of 
this note, but I wanted to try to make sure that you're up-to-date.  Please 
don't hesitate to give me a call if you'd like to discuss further.

Best,
Jeff

1711,"Jeff,

Good to see you in New York last week at the Guggenheim -- I enjoyed your 
company at the dinner.  Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush 
Energy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from 
Lisa Jacobson's and my perspective.  Many of the recommendations in the 
Energy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve.  
However, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate 
opportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of 
the plan beneficial to Enron.
 
Short-term opportunities

$2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies:  There may be 
opportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for 
technologies such as NOx Tech.  While the bulk of this money could take 
several years to approve, there is ""clean coal"" program money available now 
for FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money.   I have 
already discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we 
have good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as 
they see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money 
because we are serious about moving technologies to market.   

Climate Change R&D:  Any financial support the government puts toward climate 
change R&D could likely also be utilized for new generation/control 
technologies, but this would be a longer-term opportunity.

New Source Review (NSR) Reforms -  NSR has been an obstacle to constructing 
new generation, but also a huge thorn in the side of big coal-using utilities 
who would like to make modifications to keep grandfathered plants alive as 
long as possible.  The Clinton/Browner EPA brought major enforcement lawsuits 
against a number (Southern, TVA, AEP, Cinergy) and a few have settled 
(Cinergy, TECO). The Bush Energy Plan asks the EPA and Justice Dept. to look 
at 1) possible changes to the NSR enforcement lawsuits and 2) longer term 
changes to NSR regulation -- all in the name of bringing more energy supply 
on line.  The utilities are mounting very aggressive lobbying efforts to 
change NSR.

A DOJ decision on the enforcement could be forthcoming in the short term 
(summer 2001).  In the big picture for Enron, letting the big, coal-using 
utilities off the hook would not be the best outcome -- enforcement relief 
only holds benefits for the incumbents and not new entrants in the power 
development market.   But if it happens, we'll make sure the EGM folks have 
good advance warning so that they can take advantage of any coal trading or 
technology plays that they might find as a result from these utilities moving 
forward with plant modifications or capacity increases.

Any NSR regulatory changes will be fought over the longer-term (with 
resistance from environmentalists), and could also likely be addressed in the 
multipollutant debate -- see below.

Long Term Opportunities/Advocacy

Multipollutant legislation -  A regulatory program that all at once 
streamlines regulation of NOx, SO2 and mercury as well as provides relief 
from NSR requirements could be extremely beneficial for EGM's emissions 
trading and technology businesses (as well as a number of other Enron 
businesses).   Nationwide trading for these pollutants would open up markets 
and create liquidity far beyond the current programs.   Regulatory certainly 
for generators seeking to upgrade, expand and improve efficiency at power 
plants could provide incentives for technology and risk management services.

Our Environmental Strategies group has developed a multipollutant plan that 
achieves a number of goals for Enron, including nationwide cap-and-trade for 
3 (or even 4, if CO2 is included) pollutants in a way that provides 
incentives for new technologies, promotes fuel diversity, and has economic 
safeguards in place.   We've structured it to have multiple benefits to 
Enron, and we are working on getting key Administration and congressional 
officials to adopt our ideas.   We're making progress, but expect this debate 
to go on for at least a few years.

Here are some excerpts from recent slides summarizing our plan, if you're 
interested.



Please let us know if you have any questions - we are happy to work with you 
and anyone in EGM to take advantage of opportunities in these environmental 
proposals.

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  
Here are the main points from their conversation

1. Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with 
confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they 
hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that 
""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest 
equity holders were screaming not to do it.""

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are 
""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they 
thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the 
bankruptcy court.""

2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power 
for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only 
reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the 
market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average 
peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the 
difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State 
Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3. New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority 
(authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop 
until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  
Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer.""",Phil Angelides Anglelides Davis Angelides Kathleen Connell's,$12B bond 18 12B 400,"SoCal the

1715,"See below.  this is one of the issues that concerned us more than price caps, 
because it could limit our ability to move power to other markets in the west.

In addition, if you get questions from the analysts on ""reregulation"" or 
price caps it is worth pointing out that the high prices prevailing in many 
markets help our retail sales pitch to end use customers and create 
opportunities for our wholesale price risk management services . . .  even a 
$250 price cap is 5-10 times what large customers are accustomed to paying.

These documents would be useful in the preparation for your upcoming 
presentation in Madrid. 

The Eurelectric trip to the US (including their visit to Enron building in 
Houston) has been rather fruitful - attched is the report Eurelectric 
delegates put together upon their return from States and the slides from the 
presentation they made in Brussels for the Commission and Members of the 
European Parliament. Also attached is the memorandum from the European 
Commission on the Californian crisis. The bottomline message is that 
liberalisation process is not to be blamed for what happened in CA but rather 
a set of very complex conditions. Also, the Commission tried to highlight 
that a similar situation is highly unlikely to be reproduced in the European 
Member States.

 I contacted Cheryl Dawson the environmental manager at Enron Methanol 
regarding the Corporate Watch article.  As you can see below in Cheryl's 
response the emissions reported to EPA under the Toxic Release Inventory 
(TRI) rules  have decreased significantly since the 1997 report developed by 
Environmental Defense.  Additionally, Cheryl related to me that Enron 
Methanol was a participant in Clean Texas 200, an effort to reduce the amount 
of waste being generated annually by 50% by the year 2000.  Enron Methanol 
did achieve this goal, and has gone from a large quantity waste generator to 
a conditionally exempt small quantity generator.  This is due to the 
beneficial use by the Enron  MTBE plant of the mixed alcohol by -product from 
the Methanol plant.  In 1998 , MTBE plant began using the mixed alcohols in 
their process stream.  That is certainly a success story and is reflected in 
the reduced n-butyl alcohol TRI entry seen in Cheryl's note below.

The takeaway from both meetings was to draft a letter outlining our 
five-point solution proposal, and the CEOs would be willing to sign it and 
send to the governor and legislators.  Jeff and I drafted the letter and will 
finalize and send it to the CEOs on Monday.  I also think we ought to 
consider placing full-page ads with the letter and enlisting some of the CEOs

California State Treasurer Phil Angelides held a press  conference this afternoon to announce that $3.5 billion in interim financing has  been arranged through J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers, and that an additional $1  billion in financing is expected to be completed next week from an undisclosed  source.
 
The financing is in conjunction with an executive order issued  yesterday by the governor that allows bond sales for energy purchased by  the Department of Water Resources.  Previously, Gov. Davis and Treasurer  Angelides had sought legislative approval of the bond issuance, but were not  successful.  Further review by state attorneys determined that the governor  could authorize the issuance of bonds by executive order with the difference  that the bonds can only be used for energy purchases going forward and cannot be  used to backfill past general fund expenditures.  
 
A one-page handout summarizing the financing has been  sent to Houston.  The vital statistics are:
The authorized loan amount is $5 billion, with an initial  $3.5 billion committed;
The rate is 4.75%, but will jump to 7% if the bonds are not  issued successfully by October 31, which is the scheduled maturity date of the  loan (Angelides emphasized that this is not the due  date).

The goal of the financing is to stem the flow of funds from  the general fund for power purchases and avert a cash crisis.  The  financing, which also provides working capital for continued state energy  purchases, is secured by revenues from electricity sales and will be repaid  by the bonds.
 
Angelides noted that the financing, which he hopes to have  totally closed by July 1, precludes generators from walking away from contracts  under the clause that requires financing by a certain date.  He said it  satifsies ""most"" DWR contracts and precludes arguments made by generators  for a ""credit premium.""
 
Angelides also said that the financing is important because it  ""builds momentum"" for the huge revenue bond sale and that it ""sends a powerful  signal to Wall Street that the bond issue is real.""
 
According to his figures, the general fund is currently out  about $5.2 billion net ($6.1 billion in purchases minus $900 million in  revenues) in power purchases through June 12.
 
Steps still must occur before the bonds can be issued, he  said.  The PUC has to adopt rate agreements, adopt a servicing order with  the utilities to collect revenues to repay the bonds, and has to enact rate  increases of about 3 cents/kwh in SDG&E's territory.  Angelides noted  that the lenders have made their financial commitment event though these PUC  actions are still outstanding.
 
The bonds will not be issued until early September.   Angelides said late August is a terrible time because the financial community is  on a pre-Labor Day holiday and that the state would hold off until the more  favorable period following the holiday.
 

 
Earlier in the afternoon, the Foundation for Taxpayer and  Consumer Rights -- Harvey Rosenfield's group -- held a press conference to voice  opposition to the Edison MOU.  They all seem to agree that the MOU is  likely dead, but are afraid of it arising at a later date in some form.  
 
When asked about the business community being asked to  shoulder the costs of utilities' debt, Rosenfield said that a problem has arisen  in that business wants direct access but DWR has already purchased the power  they ""don't want.""  He believes Edison alone should be responsible for its  debt; it's government's role to go forward, he said, and Edison's job to ""clean  up its mess.""
 
Rosenfield cautioned that if legislators ""make the mistake of  paying one more penny"" towards a bailout there will be a referendum on the  bailout and the legislators voting for it.  He said they would be  held personally accountable.
 
(Exactly what he means by this is unclear.  In  California, a ""referendum"" -- which is the word he used -- is a little-used tool  to overturn legislation that has been passed and signed.  Whether he was  threatening recall attempts is also unclear.)
 
Rosenfield added that depending on how things progress, there  could be an initiative and it could include a public power  component.
 
The press release issued at the press conference, which also  featured Harry Snyder of Consumers Union, has been forwarded to Houston.   It is also available through this link: http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/utilities/pr/pr001706.php3

1728,"Jeff,

Sorry I was unable to make the call yesterday.  Thanks for the summary.  My
comments and questions are indicated below.

Please fax a copy of Plan B to be at 713 767 6677.


You suggest starting the ""process"" in Sacramento next week.  I'm not
sure exactly what this means.  Are we saying we will have a proposal
or that we will be advocating a process/forum to get all the right
parties at the table?
Did we set a time for the next call on Friday?
With regard to the Issues list, here are a few extra items:
need to make clear that real price signals should be sent to all
sectors (not just those that wouldn't vote for Davis anyway) as
soon as possible
I cannot imagine a situation in which the IOUs are returned to
financial stability within 3-6 months; my guess is that it will
be at least a year
if IOUs are returned to the procurement role, we need to make
sure that they have the appropriate risk management tools
(ability to enter forward contracts, options, etc.)
if IOUs are returned to the procurement role, we also need to
have assurances that the situation we have today won't happen
again;  for example, if the state assigns the CDWR contracts to
the IOUs and three years from now the market price is less than
the contract price, what assurances does anyone have that the PUC
will not try to make the IOUs absorb the difference
If we want to go to a core/non-core approach, why do we need to
wait 18-24 months;  it seems to me that we could start that
process now
As for legal claims and investigations, we need to make clear
that we want to resolve all state and federal claims;  the civil
claims present a different set of challenges for resolution
as for discounts on receivables, I'm not ready to commit one way
or another; however, if there are discounts they must apply to
all market participants - not just the ones that Davis can get to
the table.

1734,"Steve,
 
I think you may have heard a request last week re working closely with Dynegy.  I think we just need to treat them like other counterparties.  Basically, West Power would like to enter into arms length physical power and service transactions with Dynegy.  My understanding is that Dynegy is a separate, unrelated party until the merger closes.  Therefore, we can not ""collaborate"" with them commercially and our transaction policy is dictated by customary credit, legal and risk management procedures.  Is this correct?   If so, how do you feel about the following?
 
An Enron customer wants to buy power and related services for one year.  The customer requires Enron to post collateral.  Enron does not want to post collateral but suggests that Enron can provide the product/services to Dynegy and Dynegy can then sell to the customer.  The Enron marketer calls the Dynegy marketer and proposes a ""back to back"" transaction.   Dynegy adds a small service fee, the Enron/Dynegy contract is executed and a Dynegy/Customer contract is executed.  
 
This type of deal happens frequently - it is usually driven by the third party having better credit, transmission access or a complementary service.  We could do this with anyone, but the obvious choice is Dynegy - customers think it makes sense, and ultimately if we merge we have retained a customer.  
 
Do you think this works?
 
Regards,

State's Utilities Could Be in Hot Water as Bills Are Due Power: Whether they 
can collect funds for escalating costs is a question that worries Wall 
Street, others.
CHRIS KRAUL
  
09/22/2000 
Los Angeles Times 
Home Edition 
Page A-1 
Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company 
As the meter runs on California's electricity crisis, shock over this 
summer's price spikes is giving way to a new concern: uncertainty over 
whether and how the state's three investor-owned utilities can collect the 
staggering amounts in power costs they haven't been allowed to pass through 
to consumers. 
The unanswered question is how high the bill--now $4 billion and 
counting--will go, and whether consumers will foot all or part of it. And 
that there are no easy answers--perhaps short of an overhaul of the state's 
deregulated power market, or legislation from officials seemingly reluctant 
to act--only adds to the growing anxiety. 
Rate freezes in effect at Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric 
and San Diego Gas & Electric, which serve about three-quarters of the state's 
residents and businesses, are forcing the utilities to borrow an estimated $1 
billion a month to cover their added wholesale costs. Those loans are 
draining the companies' resources and threatening their financial structure, 
analysts say. 
The rising unpaid balance presents a longer-term burden that worries Wall 
Street, the state's business interests and, of course, the utilities. If 
passed along to consumers, the amount could ultimately negate the promised 
benefits of cheap energy that were the reason for being for the landmark 
deregulation of California's electricity industry. But making the utilities 
absorb the entire ""undercollections"" would strike a grievous financial blow 
to the companies. 
The crisis also has created a potential time bomb for shareholders of parent 
companies Edison International and PG&E Corp. Skyrocketing wholesale 
electricity costs are canceling out deregulation's underlying assumption of 
low-cost wholesale energy--and the projected generous retail margins with 
which utilities were to pay off nuclear plants and other uneconomical assets. 
The deregulation law gave utilities until March 2002 to complete the payoff, 
when open-market conditions would take over in their service areas. But with 
wholesale electricity costs where they are, the ""stranded asset"" balances are 
growing instead of shrinking--and posing an enormous potential hit for 
shareholders, who would have to absorb the remaining ""bad asset"" costs after 
the deadline passes. 
Whether the companies' shareholders or ratepayers--or both--end up footing 
the undercollection bill, all Californians could pay in the long run, 
analysts say, if current market problems remain unresolved and the state is 
seen as a less attractive place in which to do business. 
How will it all shake out? Wall Street is as much in the dark as 
Californians, said Lori Woodland, an analyst with Fitch Inc. of Chicago, one 
of three debt-rating agencies to recently lower their outlooks for Southern 
California Edison, PG&E, SDG&E and their parent companies. 
""It's not clear how regulators view this issue,"" Woodland said. ""They may 
permit the utilities to recover their costs [from ratepayers]; they may not. 
That's a big uncertainty, and it may remain this way for months. Meanwhile, 
power prices are very high, and significant amounts of money are flowing out 
the door of the utilities."" 
The uncertain prospects for collecting those billions of dollars also affect 
stock prices, and PG&E in particular has slumped in recent days as the 
implications register with investors. From a high of $31.64 on Sept. 11, PG&E 
shares have dropped to Thursday's close of $23.19 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
Amid the finger pointing and doubts, many wonder if electricity deregulation 
itself could be junked and the state's power industry re-regulated. Others 
suggest that rate freezes be extended indefinitely or hope that the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission now investigating the California electricity 
market will take corrective action to make it all better. 
Although the parties involved all seem fearful of the dimension of the crisis 
and doubtful of any near-term solution, consensus couldn't be less evident 
among the major players on how to deal with it. Although all three utilities 
agree the current market isn't working, they have not come forward with a 
common plan to solve the crisis and aren't working on one, sources say. 
Partial lifting of the rate freezes is advocated by PG&E Corp. and Sempra 
Energy, parent of SDG&E, the first state utility to pay off its stranded 
costs and thus be allowed to fully pass along wholesale costs to customers. 
The state Legislature has since stepped in to freeze SDG&E rates after a 
political firestorm fed by customer protests over bills that doubled and even 
tripled during the summer. 
Lifting the rate freeze would stem the tide of electricity undercollections, 
a sum the utilities realize is not necessarily collectible in the current 
political climate. 
""We have to fix these retail rates, which mask the true cost of electricity 
and which are creating the shortfall,"" said SDG&E President Edwin A. Guiles. 
In San Diego, for example, the average price paid by SDG&E customers zoomed 
from 11 cents per kilowatt-hour last year to 28 cents at its highest point 
this summer, before the Legislature stepped in to cap the rates, bringing the 
average price paid down to about 10 cents. 
So tinkering with the rate freeze could be politically hazardous. 
""The pain we saw in San Diego this summer is something we want to avoid for 
our customers in Northern and Central California,"" said PG&E spokesman Jon 
Tremayne. 
PG&E is expected soon to formally petition the state Public Utilities 
Commission to lift its rate freeze. The San Francisco-based utility argues 
that the $2.8-billion value of its Northern California hydroelectric 
properties, which under deregulation it is required to divest, would erase 
its stranded costs and make it eligible to pass along wholesale costs to 
consumers. 
Southern California Edison's chief financial officer, Jim Scilacci, said the 
utility could possibly be eligible to lift the rate freeze later this year if 
planned asset sales bring high enough prices. 
But with the legally mandated rate freeze in effect in San Diego, observers 
doubt that the state would let PG&E and Edison revert to market prices. 
In response, some consumer advocates are saying, in effect: Let the 
utilities, which ignored warnings of the electricity shortages at the root of 
the summer's price spikes, lie in the beds they made and pay the unforeseen 
costs of deregulation themselves. 
""Essentially this is the result of a deal gone wrong. It's buyer's remorse,"" 
said Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego 
watchdog group. ""The utilities cut a deal, and now they don't like the terms 
of the deal and they want out of it."" 
Somewhat more flexible is Ed Yates, senior vice president of the 
Sacramento-based California League of Food Processors, whose energy-intensive 
industry could be devastated by the full brunt of high wholesale energy 
costs. 
""What frightens us is that the utilities and the state could declare the rate 
freeze over and we'd have a San Diego situation,"" Yates said, referring to 
how the rising summer power costs made some San Diego County agricultural 
products noncompetitive. ""What we want is rate stability. But I don't see a 
solution. There are powerful interests at work who don't agree on the goal."" 
State officials are divided, with some including PUC President Loretta Lynch 
looking to the federal government to impose order. Gov. Gray Davis has 
discussed holding an energy summit next month to try to hash out solutions, 
but no date or agenda have been set. 
""The governor is obviously aware of the problems that California utilities 
are facing and continues to be committed to making deregulation work and is 
calling on everyone involved to act in a responsible way,"" said spokesman 
Steve Maviglio, adding that Davis has set aside much of October to work on 
the problem. 
Lynch made it clear she will be unreceptive to any solution that would have 
consumers absorbing all of the undercollections and that resolving the 
utilities' huge debts must come as part of a comprehensive overhaul of 
California's dysfunctional electricity market. 
""I don't think there is a simple solution. The utilities have a problem, I 
agree, but the resolution is much more complex than having the ratepayer eat 
the bill,"" Lynch said. ""The answer lies in a broader solution of addressing 
the wholesale energy market."" 
Unclear is how long Wall Street would wait for some kind of resolution before 
downgrading utilities' debt, the next step after the negative outlook 
revisions. 
""There are obviously many challenges presented to the power industry,"" said 
Standard & Poor's David Bodek. ""The costs are very high and at the end of the 
day have to be borne by someone. If it's the utilities, there are financial 
implications that could impact credit quality."" ","CHRIS KRAUL Lori Woodland Edwin A. Guiles Jon

(Dan, can you make sure these charts get to Steve?)

Attached are some updated charts that are more accurate with respect to 
Enron's current estimated cost of peakers in California.  Costs are up and, 
to the extent you use these types of charts, you should use these updated 
ones.  If you do not, this information will get attached somehow to our 
November 22 comments.

In general, the higher the cost to build, the worse a price cap looks in 
terms of disincentives to pursue a project.

Background on the Change:

Our origination people  (Chris Calger)  inform us that building a peaker 
plant in California is now more expensive than Enron estimated back in 
August.  These ""August"" numbers were circulated in a presentation by Tim 
Belden and were  filed with the FERC.

The peaker charts to reflect a  25% increase in capital costs.  An increase 
in costs is due to things such as: 

 longer development time (Cal ISO has dragged out the schedule)
 local permitting constraints (sound abatement, strict construction schedules)
 labor costs in California
 emission offset credit costs are higher than previously expected

These higher costs, along with the uncertainty created by price caps, has 
caused Enron to stop pursuing certain peaker, including Pleasanton.  Although 
price caps increases uncertainty and increases the cost of capital, I have 
not updated the charts to reflect a higher cost of capital as a conservatism.

Subject: Report from WTO - Part IV




INSIDE (AND OUTSIDE) THE WTO

INSIDE

 Renato Ruggiero, former Director General of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) spoke at a dinner for members of the Coalition for
Service Industries on Wednesday evening.  His remarks were some of the best
made during the WTO Seattle Round but were off the record and will probably
not appear in print.  Among his observations were:

* 1.7 billion people residing in 30 countries are trying to get into
the WTO at this time.  The WTO is regarded by many as the organization
needed to deal with the globalization in which all nations now find
themselves.
* Labor and environmental issues already have forums in which to have
their issues heard.  Their problem is that nothing works as well as the WTO.
That they want to move their issues into the WTO area is not only
understandable, it is flattering.
* (Concerning the demonstrations) ""As long as reason rules over
emotions in this world, the WTO will prevail.  The demonstrator's goals may
be right.  I don't know.  But, their aim is wrong.  The WTO should not be
their target.""
* The demonstrators have had the effect of making ministers even more
determined to finish their work.

The Seattle Round has had an interesting ancillary result.  Environmental
groups previously in disagreement or acting independently, have taken the
occasion of the WTO meeting to unify.  Greenpeace, The Sierra Club, Friends
of the Earth, The National Wildlife Federation, and The World Wildlife Fund
have been meeting before and during the Seattle Round.  Their goal is to put
a sharp focus on what they want from the WTO.  As of this writing, it is not
clear if they wish to put the WTO out of business or get their issues made
part of the negotiations but the latter is more likely.  What ever they
decide, the coalition of these environmentalists will be much more likely to
be heard in the future.

Prior to the President's arrival, agriculture and other difficult issues
were making significant headway towards resolving differences.  The
President arrived in Seattle on Wednesday amongst hopes that his visit would
have a positive effect on negotiations - but the opposite occurred.  His
ability to communicate was put to good use as he spoke to all facets of the
WTO to include the demonstrators and, until he granted an interview with the
Financial Times, the best possible face was being put on WTO negotiations.
The Times article was published on Thursday, however, and it upset everyone.
In the interview, President Clinton stated that core standards on labor
should be adopted by the WTO and included in all trade agreements.  If they
were not followed, they should be enforced with sanctions.  Until these
remarks, the administration had maintained that only a working group on
labor should be established with the mission of analyzing links between
trade and labor.  The idea of a working group was gaining steam until the
interview was published.  The United States Trade Representative was rumored
to be very upset and the President's remarks met with almost universal
condemnation.  Delegates from Japan and the European Union made strong
statements of disagreement as did most of the developing nations.  Many see
the use of sanctions as the antithesis of the WTO's mission.  There was
speculation that the remarks were made to assist Vice President Gore with
labor in his bid for the White House and that the President did not really
believe they would have any effect within the WTO.  They did - and the
effect was all negative.

President Clinton made the rounds of a number of parties that evening to
include one hosted for the members of congress who had worked on the African
Trade bill.  At one time, prior to the President's arrival, there were 30
members of Congress on the stage with Representative Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.)
and it was the broadest possible array of political beliefs.  Individuals
representing the most liberal side of the Democrat party stood side by side
with individuals from the most conservative side of the Republican party,
all waiting for the President.  When he didn't appear, the congressional
representatives left the stage and mingled with about 100 guests.  It was a
lobbyist's dream!  For 45 minutes, they talked, joked and lobbied while they
waited for the President.  He arrived, made a predictable speech and left
the stage only to find that, for security reasons, he would have to remain
in the room awhile longer.  It turned out to be one of the most festive
events of the week.

OUTSIDE

 498 people were arrested as of Thursday morning.  Delegates from
many countries were surprised that the arrests were so long in coming and
expressed significant displeasure with the turmoil in the streets.  Third
world countries have been the most critical.  Their concerns focus on
improving their economies   They need infrastructure and financing before
they can worry about the plight of sea turtles in oceans that don't even
boarder their countries.  Many of them do not disagree with America's basic
goals but they believe that rich countries ideals are standing in the way of
third world countries progress.

 As days of disturbance continue, the humor of the demonstrations is
diminishing.  What is left are hard core anarchists bent simply on
destruction.  The positive side of all this is that the goodness of people
in Seattle is now beginning to show itself.  King Country Councilman Brian
Derdowski took to the streets Tuesday evening, surveying the damage and
trying to mollify the crowds.  He saw a man grab a sack of coffee at a
vandalized Starbucks and he approached him.  Derdowski told the would-be
looter he really shouldn't take the bag of beans and the man dropped the
bag, hugged the Councilman and then walked away from the riots.

 Nancy Woodland and her husband, both Seattle attorneys, saw the
violence on television on Tuesday.  By Wednesday afternoon, they were in the
heart of town with Windex, Comet, SOS and elbow grease.  They spent most of
the day cleaning the storefronts of other peoples businesses.

 Terry Webb who owns a greeting card store, has seen his business
drop by 90%.  When interviewed by a local newspaper, he simply smiled and
reached for one of his cards.  He handed the reporter a card that read,
""Tough times are like speed bumps.  They only slow you down for a little.""

 This will be my last report from Seattle.

 Power: DWP is among three government-run producers cited as driving prices 
up. Spokesmen deny any market manipulation. 

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers

????Government-owned utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power, were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels 
that helped ignite California's exploding energy crisis during the summer and 
fall, according to public and confidential records. 
?????For months, Gov. Gray Davis, legislators and consumer advocates have 
chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into 
darkness and economic chaos. 
?????But they are just part of the equation. 
?????A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that 
have allegedly manipulated the electricity market. While the document does 
identify out-of-state merchants criticized for gouging, it also discloses for 
the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized 
profits in the volatile spot market. 
?????The document--which decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a 
recent state study--singles out three government-run agencies as consistently 
trying to inflate prices. They are: the DWP, the federally owned Bonneville 
Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canada's 
BC Hydro in British Columbia. 
?????Like a number of privately owned generators, these three producers 
offered power at a range of high prices and, sometimes, in large amounts when 
the state was most desperate. They also helped saddle California's three 
largest utilities with billions of dollars in debt--leading one, Pacific Gas 
& Electric, to seek bankruptcy protection last week. 
?????The study by the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO, 
analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large suppliers in 
the spot, or ""real-time,"" market from May to November. The study accounted 
for factors such as rising production costs, increased demand, periods of 
scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy, competitive market. 
?????Money earned above that was called excess profits. 
?????No entity--public or private--earned as much in alleged excess profits 
as British Columbia's Powerex, the state records show. 
?????""They were the most aggressive bidders,"" said Anjali Sheffrin, author of 
the coded study. 
?????""They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in,"" 
said Sheffrin, who did not discuss any companies by name. 
?????The Canadian agency reaped $176 million in alleged excessive 
profits--several times the amount collected by all but one of the private 
generators. Second on the list was Atlanta-based Southern Co. Energy 
Marketing, now called Mirant, which collected nearly $97 million in alleged 
inflated earnings. 
?????BC Hydro and Mirant--along with the DWP and other producers--say they 
played by the rules established under California's flawed deregulation plan 
and did not exploit the state's troubles. 
?????But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of 
severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise 
overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity, which could be 
produced inexpensively but sold for a premium. 
?????""It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity 
would be at any given time,"" said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins. ""We 
helped keep the lights on in California."" 
?????And the rates low for their own customers. During the past year, BC 
Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a ""rainy day"" account to 
ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America. 
?????Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power, although eighth on the list 
of alleged profiteers, was among those singled out for seeking high prices 
during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire 
spot market, where emergency purchases are made. 
?????This, according to state documents, was accomplished by offering power 
at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest 
increases in demand. The strategy also helped prop up prices, keeping them 
from falling. 
?????The DWP's average hourly bid, or asking price, for electricity 
ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston 
and Tulsa-based Williams Cos., two major players in the national energy 
market. 
?????In addition, the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that 
could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand, the report said, 
referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers. ""The data shows they 
clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load 
conditions."" 
?????DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the report's findings 
""outrageous,"" insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices. 
?????""These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes 
unpunished in this state,"" Freeman said, noting that DWP power helped avert 
more blackouts across the state. 
?????He did acknowledge, however, that the agency has charged high prices for 
surplus power at the 11th hour but said that was only because it cost more to 
produce. 
?????""We have consistently charged [Cal-ISO] our cost, plus 15%,"" he said. 
""It's not as though we're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down 
their throats."" 
?????Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report, they never 
took it personally. ""If you're innocent,"" he said, ""you don't look at the 
criminal file."" 
?????Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in California's 
deregulated market was the U.S. government's Bonneville Power Administration, 
a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal 
dams in the Columbia-Snake River basin. 
?????Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP, records show, but 
reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it 
supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied. Bonneville was 
in the top five accused of taking excessive profits. 
?????Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back 
federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon 
recovery program. 
?????Stephen Oliver, a Bonneville vice president, said his agency did not act 
improperly and has asked Cal-ISO for detailed information on how it reached 
its conclusions. He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading 
for last-minute electricity and offering to pay high prices. 
?????""From our point of view, we bid what we had when we had it and we 
operated precisely within the terms of their rules,"" Oliver said. 
?????Those rules--and the bidding practices criticized by Cal-ISO--so 
distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp. of Missouri, which tried to act 
responsibly, has bailed out. 
?????It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier 
studied--slightly more than $8 per megawatt-hour, compared to Mirant's $138, 
the highest. 
?????But the spot market, as initially designed, made sure that all suppliers 
offering power received the highest price paid in any hour. 
?????The result: Aquila collected $171 an hour for power it was willing to 
sell at a single-digit price. 
?????""They weren't the culprits,"" said Cal-ISO's Sheffrin. ""Someone else 
drove that up."" 
?????Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California 
market because it was too unpredictable. Although the company made money, he 
said, it also could have lost because of possible downward swings. 
?????""We looked at it and we didn't feel very comfortable with what we saw,"" 
he said. 
?????The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the 
price for everyone. But Sheffrin said it hasn't made much difference because 
the overall prices are still excessive. 
?????""We're saying the patient is sick,"" Sheffrin said of California's 
electricity market. ""It needs help [and] may die.""

1758,"It looks like there are about 12 articles in the San Diego Union concerning 
bidders in the San Diego market. Following are other articles and letter to 
the editor.



SDG&E is entertaining offers from major power companies for a fixed-price
contract to stabilize electricity prices. The utility has received at least
one proposal from Enron Corp. for a multiple-year contract at prices less
than half current levels -- but 50 percent above prices in the spring.



""It's like apples and oranges,"" said Thomas Williams, the Duke spokesman. 
He noted that Roseville had recently secured power at 4.9 cents from Enron
-- a Duke competitor -- but had signed a five-year contract.



Letters to the Editor

The real reason our electric rates are so high is because San Diego Gas &
Electric made a major goof by selling off all its power plants to other
utilities. That's why only San Diego County is suffering from deregulation.

The rest of the state is being served by other utilities that have plants. 
They can produce electricity for about 11 cents per kilowatt hour. They do
not need much of the California power pool electricity.

However, SDG&E's parent company, Sempra, has no local power generators and
is forced to take all of its electricity from the pool, which is being
exploited by large out-of-state utilities, such as Enron, which is charging
25 cents per kilowatt hour. The California power pool sells all power at
the same rates, but only Sempra is forced to buy large quantities.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
16-Jul-2000 Sunday 
I find it difficult to believe your readers are surprised by the recent
rise in electricity rates. Opponents to deregulation predicted the outcome
some years ago before AB 1847 was passed. Anyone with a simple education in
economics would foresee that with deregulation the utilities would direct
their marketing at the largest users who would lock in low rates by
contract. In the end, the individual homeowner would pay for any rate
increases.

Advising people to lock in a rate with Enron or a similar company will not
resolve the problem. Someone somewhere at the lower end of the food chain
will have to pay the deregulated power rate.

If one had even read AB 1847, one would have discovered that the initial 10
percent rate reduction was paid for by issuance of state bonds and guess
who will pay those off. As you may now realize, the power generation
industries in California and New York were not interested in any studies
based on reality, which were discarded.

The public's lack of diligence with pending legislation will be paid for by
the same public. The studies were available, but I guess that initial rate
reduction was more appealing.

State Sen. Steve Peace is realizing that deregulating the power industry
from one monopoly (SDG&E) to another (Enron) isn't working. Well, duh! And
to compensate for his stupidity, we the consumers should make ourselves
heard through ""economic disobedience.""

The real statement and fresh resolve from Peace are his apology to all of
his constituents that relied on and voted for him, to reverse and fix this
ridiculous mistake.

I hope he had our best interests at heart when he bought into this idea. 
Who specifically lobbied him for this? Has anyone else noticed the
deafening silence by all our other elected state officials from San Diego? 
We have the highest gas prices, highest milk prices and now highest power
prices!

Does anybody in state government care about the people? Or is this the
Republican doctrine of less government in action?

	Securities and Exchange Commission Bush Formally Nominates New SEC Chair, Tapping Former General Counsel Harvey Pitt	


President Bush formally nominated Washington lawyer Harvey Pitt July 10 to become the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a spokesman for the Senate Banking Committee confirmed that day. 
Pitt, a partner in Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, served as general counsel of the SEC from 1975 to 1978 before entering private practice. The White House said May 10 that it would nominate Pitt to head the agency. 
Pitt's nomination will be considered by the Senate Banking Committee, which is headed by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.), before it can be voted on by the full Senate. The committee spokesman told BNA that no confirmation hearing has yet been scheduled. 
If confirmed by the Senate, Pitt would serve the remainder of a five-year term expiring June 5, 2003. He would succeed Arthur Levitt, a Democrat, who chaired the SEC for seven and a half years before stepping down in February. Levitt was the longest serving SEC chairman in the agency's 67-year history. 

Large Law Practice

Since Levitt's departure, Commissioner Laura Unger has served as the commission's acting chairman. Currently, Unger and Commissioner Isaac Hunt are the only two members of the SEC. 
At Fried Frank, Pitt has developed one of the country's largest and best known securities law practices. He has represented securities industry groups and companies in dispute with the SEC. However, Pitt is perhaps most renowned for having served as defense counsel to the notorious Ivan Boesky at the time of the Wall Street insider trading scandals in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
Pitt received a J.D. from St. John's University Law School and is a graduate of City University of New York, Brooklyn College. 
In May, news of the president's intention to nominate Pitt sparked seemingly universal praise by key members of Congress, regulators, the securities bar, and the securities industry. 
In response to the formal nomination, the Senate Banking Committee's ranking Republican member, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), issued a statement saying, ""Mr. Pitt has few peers in his depth of experience in the operation of America's securities markets and the impact of the laws and regulations which protect investors."" Gramm said he looked forward to ""timely consideration"" of Pitt's nomination. 
At the same time, Securities Industry Association President Marc Lackritz said of Pitt in a statement, ""I believe that under his leadership, the SEC will be an effective advocate for efficient, fair, competitive, and well-regulated U.S. capital markets."" The association's general counsel, Stuart Kaswell remarked that ""there is no one with a more in-depth knowledge of securities law,"" and said that Pitt will do ""a great job representing investors' interests.""

relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the 
transmission system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual 
interconnections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could 
create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and

Special situations

These tips for identifying investment opportunities will help you find
stocks that can move up even when the stock market is flat on its back.

By Michael Sivy

As long-time readers of this column know, I like to focus mainly on the
biggest, most financially healthy companies. Such blue-chip growth stocks
are well-followed by Wall Street analysts and by the media, so their
prospects are generally reflected in the share price. Occasionally,
however, those stocks get undervalued -- but they generally return to fair
valuations within a few years. If you buy them when they're down, odds are
you'll at least match -- and probably slightly outpace -- the general
market over a decade or longer. (For a list of the stocks I think are most
worth tracking, see the Sivy 100.)
[ http://www.money.com/sivy100/ ]

There are, however, smart ways to enhance that basic strategy. Some
investors, for example, search for so-called ""special situations,"" stocks
that will rise or fall based on unique events, like a takeover bid or a
corporate restructuring. Anticipating such events takes some savvy, but
there are guideposts that can help. One excellent source for those tips is
The Superstock Investor, a new book by Charles LaLoggia and Cherrie Mahon,
published by McGraw Hill.

I've known Charlie for more than a decade and he's spotted a lot of great
opportunities, particularly among midcap and smaller stocks that aren't
well followed by analysts. In fact, I featured one of his recommendations
in Sivy on Stocks last November 8 -- United Industrial [UIC], a small
defense-related company with little debt. Since then, the stock has risen
40 percent to $16 a share.

Since every special situation is different, the best way to learn about
them is to read through a lot of case studies -- and Charlie's book is full
of them. But he also lists a number of signs to watch for that can help you
identify a stock poised for big gains. The most important thing to remember
is that a special situation needs a catalyst that can unlock its value.
Here are 10 potential triggers:

* An outside investor files a 13-D form with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, revealing that it has accumulated more than 5 percent of a
company's stock.

* A company with one outsider that owns more than 5 percent of the stock
attracts other investors who buy big stakes.

* An outside owner announces that it is seeking ways to enhance shareholder
value or expresses an interest in selling its stake.

* A dispute about the best way to get the stock price up breaks out between
a company's management and a major outside shareholder.

* A company with one or more large outside owners announces a stock buyback
program, giving more influence to the biggest shareholders who will push to
get the stock price up.

* A company in a consolidating industry sells or spins off non-core assets,
thereby turning itself into a pure play that is likely to be even more
attractive to potential acquirers.

* A company in a consolidating industry announces a restructuring charge
that causes its share price to decline substantially, making the stock
highly attractive to potential acquirers.

* A company in a consolidating industry is partially owned by a brokerage
or buyout firm that could devise a strategy to boost the value of its stake.

* The founder of a company who owns more than 10 percent of the stock
passes away, removing potential opposition to an acquisition.

* A company that owns a stake in another company is itself acquired,
leading the acquirer to try to raise cash by selling the stake and putting
the company in play.

None of these factors by itself is a reason to invest in a company. But if
the stock is attractive on fundamental grounds, the chance that it will
turn out to be a special situation provides an enormous kicker.

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

Notice # 01-184
May 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Reminder on Use of Money Market Funds as Original Margin Deposits on the
NYMEX Division

DATE:
May 31, 2001
===========================================================
This Notice is a reminder regarding certain rule changes and related policy
guidelines that will go into effect on June 1, 2001 for the NYMEX Division.
The rule changes going into effect on June 1, 2001 on the NYMEX Division
allow shares of certain money market mutual funds to be acceptable for
purposes of original margin deposits.

Corresponding rule changes for the COMEX Division  have also been approved
by the NYMEX Board of Directors and filed with the CFTC; the changes for
the COMEX Division will be implemented at a later date.

     Rule Amendments
The amendments generally require that in order to be used for such purpose,
a money market fund must be approved by the NYMEX Board and also must
comply with CFTC Regulation ? 1.25.  For purposes of original margin, the
Exchange's Clearing House will value such money market fund shares at 95%
of their market value.  In addition, a Clearing Member's participation in
any approved fund or any group of approved funds offered by the same issuer
shall be limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member's
total original margin obligations. Finally, no more than 25% of the total
assets of an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original
margin obligations at the Exchange.

Exchange Policy on Money Market Funds
The NYMEX Board of Directors also recently adopted three additional
guidelines that will be applicable to such funds. First, until further
notice from the Exchange, the Board has determined to limit the number of
money market funds available for this purpose to ten. Second, the Board
will require that henceforth each fund applying for such status must have a
minimum value of $5 billion.  Finally, each fund further must provide for
same day payment if notification is made by 3:00 p.m. on that day.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section,
NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Joseph Sanguedolce,

(E) Clearing Members may meet original margin calls by depositing:



*(4) Shares in a money market mutual fund that complies with CFTC

(ii) a Clearing Member's participation in any approved fund or any group of

Notice # 01-186
June 1, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Clearing Members

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit, Certain
Securities and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin  for NYMEX and
COMEX Transactions

DATE:
June 1, 2001
===========================================================

1. Implementation of Rule Amendments. As previously announced in Notice to
Members #01-147 (May 4, 2001), this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX
Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today, June 1,
2001, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may deposit
with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

2. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit. Clearing Members are
further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will
serve as the authorized  uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for
use on a pass-through basis at the Exchange.  This form may be obtained
from the Exchange's Clearing Department.

3. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit: Specification of Joint
Beneficiary. The Pass-Through Letter of Credit differs from the Standard
Letter of Credit in that the Pass-Through Letter of Credit provides for
Joint Beneficiaries.  In this regard, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be
used as margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the
Joint Beneficiaries.  By comparison, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be
used as margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing
Association as one of the Joint Beneficiaries.

4. Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit. Please note that, under
applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules, a Clearing Member that is a bank
subsidiary or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable
Clearing House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank, bank
parent or affiliate bank.




As to the actual rule amendments, which are attached below, these rule
changes permit the use of letters of credit, certain securities and
deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin
requirements. The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use
of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions.

Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit
(LCs) now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule
changes allow letters of credit to be used on a ""pass-through"" basis on
both divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be
able to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by
customers. It should be noted that while securities and deliverable
warehouse receipts, as detailed below, may be used by customers for margin
purposes, such assets may not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing
Member to meet its margin obligations with the clearinghouse.

Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing
Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable
securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some
time on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit
customers to deposit the following types of securities as margin with
Clearing Members on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the
American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter
market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any
one issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their
market value.

Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse
receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted
as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at
no more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section,
NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Charles Bebel, Vice
President, Clearing Department, at (212) 299-2130.


AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 4.01 (""CUSTOMER'S MARGINS""), NYMEX RULE 9.05
(""MARGINS"") AND TO COMEX CLEARING ASSOCIATION RULE 48 (""DEPOSIT OF
SECURITIES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT AS ORIGINAL MARGIN"")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 4.01. CUSTOMER'S MARGINS

(A) Initial margin at least equal to the level set for customers shall be
required of all customers. In no case shall a customer's initial margin be
less than a specified amount per contract, or a specified percentage of the
market value at which any commodity is bought or sold, such customer's
margin to be determined and announced by the Board of Directors or its
designee.

 (B) Once the required initial margin has been deposited for each
individual transaction, such trade and such margin shall, for the purposes
of this rule, lose their individual identity and be commingled with all
other trades and margins in the same commodity for the same customer
account.

 (C) When the margin (Net Liquidating Value plus Non-Cash Deposits) in a
customer's account declines below the maintenance margin requirement
applicable to the open positions carried in such account, the Member Firm
carrying said account is required to collect (call) from the customer such
funds, which when deposited, will restore it to the then prevailing initial
margin requirement.

 (D) A Member Firm shall not accept orders for new trades on behalf of an
undermargined customer account other than those which reduce its initial
margin requirement unless such Member Firm has been given assurances by
said customer that funds sufficient to restore the account to its then
prevailing initial margin requirement are forthcoming and will be received
in a reasonable amount of time not to exceed one business day for Floor
Members and three business days for all other customers.

(E)(1) A Member Firm may accept deposits from its customers in one or more
of the following forms as margin to cover open NYMEX Division positions:

 (a) United States Currency; or any currency freely convertible to United
States currency; provided that if foreign currency is deposited, its value
shall be calculated so that at the current rate of exchange the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the foreign currency satisfies the customer's margin
obligation.

 (b) securities issued by the Department of the Treasury of the United
States maturing within ten (10) years of the date of the deposit and
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States Government.
Such securities shall be valued at ninety five percent (95%) of par value.

*(c) securities which are listed for trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. or the American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in
the over-the-counter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve Board provided that such securities; (i) are free
from liens and encumbrances; (ii) represent no more than 5% of the issued
and outstanding shares of any one issuer; and (iii) are valued at 75% of
the market value thereof;

(d) a letter of credit in favor of a clearing member carrying an account,
or in the case of any letter or credit to be used on a pass-through basis
with the Clearing House a letter of credit in favor of the Exchange.  All
letters of credit shall be issued in such form as may be prescribed by the
Exchange and by a depository which has been approved by the Exchange for
issuance and confirmation of letters of credit drawn in favor of the
Clearing Members or in favor of the Exchange, as applicable.

(e) deliverable warehouse receipts for commodities traded on the Exchange
provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at no more than 75% of
the value of the commodity.*

[(c)] *(f)* The net liquidating value in a customer's account over the
initial margin requirements for the positions carried for such account.

(2) A Member Firm may accept deposits from its customers in one or more of
the following forms as margin to cover open COMEX Division positions:

(a) United States currency, checks payable in United States currency, or
currency freely convertible to United States currency; provided that if
foreign currency is deposited, its value shall be calculated so that at the
current rate of exchange the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreign currency
satisfies the customer's margin obligations;

(b) the net liquidating value in a customer's account over the initial
margin requirements for the positions carried for such account;

(c) securities issued or guaranteed by the United States, provided that
such securities shall be valued at the lower of the par or market value
thereof;

(d) securities which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. or the American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the
over-the-counter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve Board provided that such securities; (i) are free from
liens and encumbrances; (ii) represent no more than 5% of the issued and
outstanding shares of any one issuer; and (iii) are valued at 75% of the
market value thereof;

(e) *deliverable* warehouse receipts *for commodities traded on the
Exchange provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at no more
than 75% of the value of the commodity*; [provided that such warehouse
receipts shall be valued in accordance with the following:

(i) if the warehouse receipt is for a deliverable grade of the commodity
underlying either the futures contract sold or the futures contract which
is the subject of the call options sold, not more than 90% of the value of
the commodity may be considered as margin; and;

(ii) if the warehouse receipt is for a deliverable grade of the futures
contract purchased or the put options sold, not more than 75% of the value
of the commodity may be considered as margin; and;

(iii) if the warehouse receipt is for either: (A) deliverable grade of a
commodity other than the commodity underlying the futures contract or
option to be margined; or (B) a form of silver or gold not deliverable
under a futures contract, then not more than 75% of the value of the
warehouse receipt may be considered as margin.]

(f) physical commodities (but not forward contracts therefor) if the
carrying member is in possession and control of negotiable documents
covering such commodities, provided, however, that the value of such
commodities shall be based upon the contract market price for the grade of
such commodity or if the commodity is not of a grade deliverable on a
contract market, then at the price for the grade of such commodity on the
spot market;

(g) a letter of credit in favor of a clearing member carrying an account*,
or in the case of any letter or credit to be used on a pass-through basis
with the Clearing House a letter of credit in favor of the Exchange.  All
letters of credit shall be* issued in such form as may be prescribed by the
Exchange and by a depository which has been approved by the Exchange for
issuance and confirmation of letters of credit drawn in favor of the
Clearing Members *or in favor of the Exchange, as applicable.*

 (3) Calls issued by Member Firms for additional margin from customers may
only be met by: deposits conforming to the requirements of Rule 4.01(E)(1)
for open NYMEX Division positions, or conforming to the requirements of
Rule 4.01(E)(2) for open COMEX Division positions, or, for open positions
on either division of the Exchange, favorable market movements which, when
taken into consideration and combined with any other monies available,
enable the customer's margin to equal or exceed the then prevailing initial
margin requirement.

 (F) Withdrawals of margin from a customer's account may only be permitted
by a Member Firm carrying such account if the remaining funds in such
account are equal to or in excess of the then prevailing initial margin
required of the applicable open positions at the time of said withdrawal
request.

(G) The customer's response to a margin call issued by a Member Firm must
be timely and complete. A Member Firm may call, at any time, for margins
above and beyond the minimums required by the Exchange. A Member Firm may
liquidate any or all positions maintained by a customer for failure to meet
a margin call. The customer will be liable for any loss or deficiency
resulting therefrom.

 (H) The margin requirements established by the Board or its designee may
vary for different commodities and may be changed from time to time by the
Board or its designee, and in the discretion of the Board or its designee,
may be made applicable to all open trades as well as new trades.

 (I) Arbitrage

(1) For the purposes of Exchange margin requirements, an arbitrage position
is a purchase or sale of an Exchange futures contract in one delivery month
which futures contract is offset by a futures contract to sell or to
purchase a similar quantity of a related commodity in the same or different
delivery month which offsetting futures contract is executed on or subject
to the rules of a different exchange. In order to qualify as an arbitrage
position, each contract long and short must be carried by the same member
firm for the same account.

(2) The Board of Directors, by resolution, may identify those futures
contracts, that are executable on and/or subject to the rules of a
different exchange, which shall be deemed to qualify as part of an
arbitrage position.

(3) The Board of Directors or its designee may set levels of margin for
arbitrage positions at a rate less than applicable to outright positions;
provided, however, that except for interdivision straddles, no such rate
shall be lower than the rates established for clearing members' margins.


Rule 9.05. MARGINS

*    *    *    *
(E) Clearing Members may meet original margin calls by depositing:

(1) Cash (U.S. Currency);

(2) Original Margin Certificates issued by an original margin depository,
in form acceptable to the Clearing House, for delivery to the order of the
Clearing House, representing securities issued by the Department of
Treasury of the United States of America maturing within ten (10) years
from the date of the deposit and guaranteed as to principal and interest by
the United States Government; such securities shall be valued at ninety
five percent (95%) of the par value; or

(3) Subject to a maximum limit of 50% of the Clearing Member's total
original margin obligations, Irrevocable Letters of Credit payable to the
order of the Clearing House *including such Letters of Credit that are
deposited with the Clearing Member in accordance with Exchange procedures
by a customer*, in form acceptable to the Clearing House, issued by or
confirmed by an original margin depository and having an expiration date of
not less than three (3) or more than eighteen (18) months from the date of
issuance; provided, however, that such Letter of Credit may not be used to
meet original margin obligations during the fifteen calendar days prior to
the expiration date thereof (if the fifteenth day prior to the expiration
of the Letter of Credit is not a business day, the period during which such
Letter of Credit may not be used to meet original margin obligations shall
begin on the business day immediately preceding that day); and, provided
further, that on the business day!
!
 preceding the fifteenth calendar day prior to the expiration of the Letter
of Credit, the Clearing House shall issue a call for original margin to be
deposited in a form and manner acceptable to the Clearing House for
positions held open as of the close of business on that day and margined by
the Letter of Credit. The Clearing House shall have the unqualified right
to call on any Letter of Credit at any time prior to expiration.

Building boom

Prospects for a strong economy next year are boosting the share prices of
companies like Caterpillar and Fluor.

By Michael Sivy

The stock market has been listless since mid-May, marked by low trading
volume and weak share prices. But although the financial media seem to be
focusing almost entirely on daily earnings warnings and weak trading volume
trends, the accumulating evidence points to an excellent 2002. Most
Fedwatchers think that chairman Alan Greenspan will cut interest rates at
least one more time this summer -- probably at the June 26-27 meeting.
Since rate cuts need six to nine months to take effect and the first cut
occurred in January, the economy should be picking up by October at the
latest -- and should continue to gather momentum through the early part of
next year.

The consensus forecast for 2002 is that the economy will grow more than 3
percent, that unemployment will hold steady below 5 percent, and that oil
prices will come down slightly. That, in turn, should lead to a small
decline in inflation. Accelerating growth combined with falling inflation
is the magic formula for a rising stock market. And though neither trend
figures to be strong, they both are definitely going in the right
direction. Not surprisingly, such an economy is great news for cyclicals,
such as construction-related businesses.

One stock I like is Caterpillar [CAT], the world's largest maker of
earthmoving equipment, especially big-ticket machines that can weigh more
than 50 tons and sell for $500,000. I first recommended the shares in
August at $39, or about 11 times this year's estimated earnings. Since
then, the shares have appreciated 43 percent to $55.80. Despite that run,
shares trade at just 16.4 times next year's estimated results, and are
still 10 percent below their all-time high, set in 1999.

One reason the stock's price/earnings ratio remains moderate is that
profits are expected to rise more than 30 percent next year, as the economy
rebounds. Such growth isn't sustainable, but longer term, earnings should
be able to rise at a compound annual rate of 11 percent. Include the 2.4
percent yield, and the stock's total return potential still looks quite
attractive.

A slightly riskier, but potentially lucrative choice is Fluor [FLR], a
leading construction and engineering firm that is just coming out of a
major restructuring. Fluor manages enormous projects, such as building oil
refineries and electricity-generating plants. Given U.S. energy needs over
the next five years, as well as likely demand for other big construction
projects as the economy rebounds, Fluor should be set to enjoy good times.

The stock is up a little over 12 percent since I recommend it in April. At
a current $57.40 a share, the stock trades at 23.4 times next year's
estimated earnings. Profits are expected to rise more than 23 percent next
year, and earnings could rise at a 12.5 percent compound rate over the next
five years. Moreover, once a coherent U.S. energy policy is in place --
presumably before the end of the year -- investor attention will likely
shift even more to a company that boosts the nation's capacity to keep
gasoline and electrons flowing.

This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Shattered glass

Reflections from the Corning debacle.

By Michael Sivy

NEW YORK (CNNmoney) - I receive e-mails from time to time taking me to task
because stocks that I like have gone down. Not surprisingly, these e-mails
have become more frequent in the past six months as the bear market has
worsened. But not all stock market disappointments can be fully explained
by the recession. Some stock disasters are genuinely shocking and seem to
violate all the principles that usually keep investors out of serious
trouble. Such cases are worth special consideration and analysis.

There is no stock that has surprised me more over the past year than
Corning, the world's leading maker of fiber optic cable. Had you told me a
year ago that Corning (GLW: down $0.12 to $7.90, Research, Estimates)  was
going to drop from more than $100 a share to less than $8 today, I would
have said that was practically impossible. And yet it happened.

The fundamental case for Corning seems unassailable. The former maker of
high-performance glass discovered that the company's expertise could be
much more profitably employed in high-tech than in making ovenproof
cookware. The burgeoning telecom market had a seemingly endless appetite
for fiber optic cable. And Corning quickly became the world's biggest
producer with 40 percent of the market. Moreover, the company not only was
the big-volume producer but was also the leader in the most-profitable
cutting-edge fiber optics.


Then came the problems

Only trouble was that telecom companies became so overconfident in the late
1990s that they laid far more cable than they actually needed. In fact,
there will be excess capacity for at least another 12 months. Needless to
say, few customers are going to order a lot of cable from Corning in the
interim. So sales volume in some product lines is down more than 50 percent.

In its third-quarter report, released after the market closed on Thursday,
Corning announced a 74 percent drop in operating earnings to 9 cents a
share. And that was the good news. Aftertax restructuring costs for the
quarter were $222 million. More restructuring charges are still to come.
The fourth quarter will likely result in an operating loss of at least 20
cents a share. And Corning's chief fiber optic cable plants will be idled
for at least two months.

At this point, there are three questions that need to be answered. Where
does Corning go from here? Is there any point at which it would be a
contrarian buy? And finally, is there anything to be learned from the
situation?

If I owned individual tech stocks rather than indexes, I would have owned
Corning, I would have held it throughout the decline -- and I certainly
wouldn't sell it here. The company remains the dominant player in fiber
optic cable. And for all the cable that has been laid, there is still 10
times as much left to do. Moreover, when the wiring starts again, Corning
will profit from being the technological leader with the best high-margin
products.

On the negative side, Corning is spending somewhere in the neighborhood of
$1 billion on restructuring. Less than half of that is in cash and Corning
has more than $1.5 billion on hand, so serious financial problems are
unlikely. But they are possible if business deteriorates far more than
anyone expects. At this point, I would treat Corning stock like an option.
The upside is enormous -- three or four times the current price in a couple
of years. But the risk is much greater than usual for a stock of Corning's
quality.

The most basic truth to be learned from the Corning story is that your
reasoning can be impeccable and you can still lose your shirt on a stock.
Corning seemed to have everything going for it -- leadership and
technological dominance in a market with a very high core growth rate and
an exemplary balance sheet. Corning is the poster child for
diversification. The goal is not so much guarding against obvious risks,
but rather guarding against risks that can't happen -- but do.

Two final thoughts. Corning traded as high as 91 P/E last year, and market
historians will tell you that as a rule no company sustains a P/E of more
than 50 for any length of time. There's just not enough good news in the
world for that. Finally, one-product companies -- no matter how brilliant
that product may be -- always carry special risks. In the short run at
least, the market for Corning's fiber has turned out to be an optical
illusion.

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.

1820,"This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Higher Flyer

Top techs such as Nokia may not look cheap by traditional valuation
measures. But they may still be good buys.

By Michael Sivy

Value is a relative term. Every once in a while, you get a chance to buy
shares in a company with annual earnings growth of more than 20 percent at
a price/earnings ratio of 16 or less. But that doesn't happen very often.
Most of the time, conservative investors are lucky to find 14 percent
growth at a 16 P/E. Slightly more aggressive investors might be happy with
18 percent growers at P/Es in the low 20s. The most successful growth
stocks, however, may never fall all the way down to those cheap valuations.
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy them.

In fact, there are good reasons to devote at least a part of your portfolio
to those kinds of high flyers. For one thing, those companies are typically
among the world's most successful. In addition, they receive ongoing
support and sponsorship from Wall Street analysts. As long as they continue
to meet expectations, they will hold up fairly well in temporary market
downturns. And they will be among the first stocks to bounce back.

A perfect case in point looks to be Nokia [NOK]. The Finnish giant is the
most successful firm in one of the world's most rapidly growing industries.
And since 1997, Nokia's share of the global wireless-phone handset market
has risen from less than 20 percent to 35 percent, helping the company
nearly double earnings per share since 1998.

Of course, no company can increase its market share indefinitely, but there
are several factors that should help sustain Nokia's superior profit
growth. Since most everyone who would use a cell phone already has one, the
bulk of the sales of cell phones using existing technology is replacement
business. And when existing users switch phones, they tend to maintain
brand loyalty -- if they change providers at all, they migrate toward the
strongest one (say from Ericsson to Nokia, but not the other way around).
As a result, Nokia could gain another couple of market share points in
current-technology handsets.

Even more important, the company is capable of attaining a market share
topping 40 percent in the next generation of handsets -- both those that
use more sophisticated technology for voice transmission and those that
will provide paging, instant messaging, and Internet access. Overall, the
handset market is projected to grow at an annual compound rate of just
under 23 percent over the next four years. And with market share gains,
Nokia's sales should do even better.

In the past few quarters, the over-capacity problems that have plagued the
telecom industry have been hurting handset makers as well as service
providers. Not only has growth slowed -- total sales of cell phones were up
only 12 percent in the first quarter -- but the introduction of new
technology is being delayed. As a result, Nokia's earnings, up just 15
percent in the first quarter, will likely fall short of a 20 percent gain
for the year as a whole.

Once the current slump passes, however, Nokia's growth should recover to
nearly 25 percent a year. And so, despite a P/E of 40 based on estimated
earnings for the current year, the stock seems quite attractive. At $33,
Nokia is trading at just over half the level it was a year ago. And the
share price, which dipped as low as $21 a month ago, now appears to be in
an upswing. Even if the next couple of quarters show subpar results, Nokia
figures to be back among the market's brightest stars within 12 months.

- UBS do not want us to show ""UBSWenergy.com"" - they require ""www.ubswenergy.com"" (no caps) or ""ubswenergy.com"" (no ""www"").
- This means that for the homepage to look right, we will change the name to ""UBS Warburg Energy"" beside the globe graphic.
- Currently anticipate starting Top 50 marketing for PA's by tomorrow morning (UBS required changes on Splash page).
- Some traders in the market have started to refer to us as UB SOL. Although the low-profile approach we discussed made sense, on further reflection, I think we need to aggressively promote a positive short name for the system, to avoid the ""SOL"" connotation. Even ""UBS Energy"" is a lot of syllables. We are working on finding some alternative (perhaps which don't use ""UBS"" in the name, as that seems to be a sensitive point). If we are to do this, we will need to lobby at a level higher than where I have been so far. If you agree with my concern, some higher level contact might be in order; perhaps with some of the people you have been meeting?
- Will work with legal today on Master Agreements and GTC's, to try to get template approval AND to draft Masters for the Top 50, with specific credit terms.

1872,"Not done - but good progress:

We reached agreement with the water bank late last night on the definitive agreement.  The members of the bank are going to their respective boards today and tomorrow and are saying that they are prepared to sign tomorrow.  They have flaked on us in the past, so there is still a decent chance we dont get done soon, but in general we are pleased that they moved so quickly during the past week.

Calpine started being difficult yesterday re the timing of closing, water (they now want the Azurix agreement with a guarantee) and taking the gas transport.  We played hardball - told them Azurix is out and that we dont need the transport.  The outcome of that position is that we will not assign our transport to them and we will opt out of our transport precedent agreement.  Calpine indicated that they have their own transport and if we dont close, they would assign us 50MMCF/Day.  I am not sure if this is their final answer but it is clearly better than them having a put back to us for 100MMCF/Day.

I suspect this will change - some for the bettter, some for the worse, but I will keep you posted.

1881,"highlights of my discussion with dave:
he wants an ""opportunity"" to originate out of the ees positions.  for example, the harrah's deal generated approximately $16 million relative to the mid, of which $4 went to ees.  he wants a chance to back this deal with his sourcing group.
he was unable to offer any definition around what the word ""opportunity"" means.  one interpretation of ""opportunity"" is that they get a head start, say three months to back a deal where neither west mm or west orig works on that deal for three months.  another interpretation is that west mm and west orig aren't allowed to talk to certain wholesale customers, for example the generators.  both of these are bad ideas.
i asked him why enron would want to keep its most talented origination resources on the sidelines for any period of time in order to let the kid brother (ees) have a ""fair"" chance at winning a deal.  i also asked him if he thought his crack squad could compete with the capabilities that we have developed in the west.  his answer was no.
i told dave that as the manager of the retail risk book i don't care who originates out of the transaction.  my thinking is that i give a copy of the harrah's contract to calger, foster, and delainey.  whoever gets us out first gets paid orig.  if people want to coordinate then that's fine.  if they want to compete head to head then that's fine.  speaking for portland, i would expect that west mm and orig would coordinate.
dave then said that he ""gave"" us the risk function and insinuated that we owed him something in return.  i indicated that i was willing to give it back and return to my simple life managing the west wholesale trading desk if that's what he wanted.  i think he took offense to that comment.
we hung up with no resolution.  dave called me back and proposed that we let anyone originate out of the position.  however, the origination dollars would go to ees profit center with the west mm or origination person getting the credit for that.  he talked about ees and the stock price and the billion dollar business.  my guys (i'm not speaking for chris here) don't care where the origination dollars go to so long as they get paid for bringing value.
i suggested that he work it out with you and that i would be looking for direction from you.

i'm pretty sure that dave will characterize our conversation as though we are in a agreement and that we are ready to move forward.  i would say that we agree that we need to get the best people originating out of these deals.  i would rather that the money for orig stay with whoever originated it.  i can live with a variety of outcomes.  i'll sit tight and wait for direction from you.

$100,000.  I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and 
wanted you to know why.

I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.  Donahue 
has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, 
both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  My 
reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something 
which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it 
will alienate a vocal few.  Electric restructuring was a key example of 
this.  There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but 
instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they 
decided to have a ""process"".  Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to 
participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it 
came time to vote.  The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform 
(with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).  Afterwards, the 
federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not 
exclusively the Chamber's fault).

Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to 
raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a 
few members will be upset.  For Enron it's a bit like paying $100,000 for a 
veto right.  The only things the organization pushes for are the things 
everyone agrees on in the business community -- eg China PNTR and lower 
corporate taxes -- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and 
things we will add our separate voice to in any event).  

As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging 
conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating 
incumbents.  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some 
members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with 
us.  They represent the status quo in the business community.  Tom is an 
extremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the 
business community.  A voice which stands for moving business to the next 
level, not just protecting its current position.

Having said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) 
has been useful to us in the past.  In previous years, Donahue himself has 
intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.  As a consequence, I 
have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members 
at a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access 
to their international activities.  I suggested something in the $25,000 
range.  That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our 
current dues to $100,000).

Currently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership, but I plan 
to defer to Linda Robertson.  I am interested in your insights, or, if you 
prefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me.","Tom

The attached one pager describes an embryonic idea for a new philanthropy 
venture that might be of interest for your panel discussion with Michael Dell 
at the Fortune conference on October 12th.

It is inspired by the populist arguments on the campaign trail against 
partial social security privatization.  I believe that if a greater number of 
Americans were corporate investors there would be a greater buy in to not 
only social security reform but to sound economic policies.  I also believe 
that redistributionist arguments would carry less weight.

Dan Eilers of Vanguard Venture Partners contacted me last week to see if 
Enron would be interested in a high level discussion of the changes occurring 
in electricity generation and management technologies.  Vanguard is an early 
stage VC fund that helped create Ciena and Network Appliance.  Dan is a new 
partner and is looking at the energy market as a new focus for Vanguard.  

He would like to have a brainstorming session with an eye on creating a 
cooperative relationship between Vanguard and Enron for the evaluation and 
development of new companies in the energy arena.

I would appreciate it if you could respond with your interest level so I 
could arrange a time that is convenient for each of you to participate.

Thanks,

Thanks for putting the issues in perspective for all of us - i.e., it is not the lack of adversity, but rather one's response to adversity, that makes one great and builds one's character.  From what you said, it sounds like Enron has faced (with integrity) some serious adversity in the past and rallied admirably - certainly no reason to think the same will not happen this tough time.  Keep steering the boat - we'll all get through this!!

1942,"Coach Jim Haslett had put together the perfect
New Orleans Saints team.
The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.

He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools,
but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback
who could ensure a Super Bowl win.

Then one night, while watching CNN,
he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia.
In one corner of the screen,
he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly
incredible arm.
He threw a hand grenade straight
into a 15th-story window 200 yards away
--ka-boom!

""I've got to get this guy!""  Haslett said to himself.
""He has the perfect arm!""
So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans
and teaches him the great game of football,
and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl
for the first time in history.

The young Bosnian is ""canonized""
as the Great Hero of football,
and when Haslett asks him what he wants,
all the young man wants to do
is to call his mother.
""Mom,"" he says into the phone,
""I just won the Super Bowl.""
""I don't want to talk to you,"" the old woman says.
""You deserted us.  You are not my son.""
""I don't think you understand, Mother!"" the young man pleads.
""I just won the greatest sporting event in the world.
I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.""
""No, let me tell you,"" the mother retorts.
""At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us.
The neighborhood is a pile of rubble.
Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday,
and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight.""
The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says ""
 ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to
New Orleans.""

ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thu=
rsday against Dallas, but we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy sta=
ts. The Cowboys will probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and M=
ike Anderson risky starts this week since they have been splitting time.  B=

 likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have questionable receivers to wor=
k w! it! h Thursday against Dallas. However, the Cowboys' defense will prob=
ably focus on the run and force Griese to beat them through the air. He sho=
uld provide your team with decent stats and is worth using this week.  Mars=
hall Faulk , RB STL - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01 Faulk had 153 scrimmage y=
ards and a touchdown against New England last weekend. He's the best player=
 in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in any league format.   Jamel Whi=
te , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Browns may use White as a cha=
nge-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar Bengals run defense. You might w=
ant to consider him as a third running back option on your team if you're l=
acking in starting options.  Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11=
/21/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy te=
am is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the =
league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will hav=
e no choice but to do.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Baja Updated 11/21/01 Warne=
r had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401 yards =
and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and will thr=
ow at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent secondary.   O.=
J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Santiago catches the occ=
asional pass for the Browns and could find the end zone every now or then. =
He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati secondary, so maybe this is one=
 of the rare weeks he scores. Only use Santiago if you're desperate for a t=
ight end, however, as he rarely gets a big yardage total.  Kevin Johnson  ,=
 WR CLE - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/01 Johnson has been a prime target for Tim=
 Couch in the Cleveland passing game this season, and is now a very reliabl=
e No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver. Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a go=
od career record against the Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get hi=
m into your lineup.  Tim Couch , QB CLE - Rocks Updated 11/21/01 Couch has =
a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards, four TDs), wh=
om he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks you could ch=
oose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week, give him a lo=
ok.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Top Dogs Updated 11/21/01 Warrick has been ca=
tching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't provided stats worth=
y of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league. His matchup against C=
leveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him reserved this week.  Darnay =
Scott , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Although Scott has caught a to=
uchdown pass in each of his last two games against the Browns, whom he play=
s Sunday, we can't recommend you use him this week. He has been far too inc=
onsistent and a real disappointment from a Fantasy perspective.  Jon Kitna =
, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 We can't advise you use Kitna as he =
goes up against the Browns' secondary this week. Cleveland has been very st=
ingy against the pass all year, leading the league in interceptions and ran=
king ninth overall in sacks.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Matt Lenhart Updated =
11/21/01 Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up agains=
t the Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678=
 rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in yo=
ur active lineup week in and week ! ou! t in any league.  Larry Centers , R=
B BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Centers has been a great pass-catching =
back for the Bills this season, but he will face a Miami defense on Sunday =
that will likely be able to contain him. Only use him if you have no other =
alternative on your bench.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated =
11/21/01 Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recen=
t weeks, logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a =
bigger challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reservin=
g him.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/21/01 There's a good=
 chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week against a solid Mi=
ami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent limited role in the=
 Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he has a good history a=
gainst the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and he might be worth usi=
ng as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.  Eric Johnson , TE SF - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/21/01 Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend again=
st Carolina. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't real=
ly worth starting at this point.    J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Update=
d 11/21/01 Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for =
72 yards and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable ove=
rall, however, so starting him is still a risky move.   Travis Henry , RB B=
UF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Henry had a very disappointing game agains=
t the Seahawks in Week 10, and will likely struggle again against the far-b=
etter Dolphins defense on Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit=
 using this week.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Van=
 Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a strong D=
olphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar Seahawk=
s, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this week d=
espite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the bench fo=
r Week 11.  ! Travis Taylor , WR BAL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/21/01 Afte=
r a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self. We d=
on't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so don't us=
e him this week.  Shannon Sharpe , TE BAL - Rocks Updated 11/21/01 Sharpe h=
as been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving touchdo=
wn on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced Jacksonville,=
 and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe into your acti=
ve lineup every week.  Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - McKay Neal Updated 11/21/01Is=
mail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly devel=
oping into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot strea=
k and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you get =
Ismail into your starting lineup this week. Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - F=
ree Agent Updated 11/21/01 Buckhalter will return from suspension this week=
end, and will be available for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Stale=
y has established himself as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhal=
ter is a gamble.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Stale=
y had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in Philadelp=
hia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes him worth =
starting in Week 11 against Washington.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Free Agen=
t Updated 11/21/01 Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two c=
atches for 17 yards like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will st=
ill be in the starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gambl=
e nonetheless.   Ron Dayne  , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/21/01 Dayne=
 has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks. He m=
ay score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for Fan=
tasy owners overall.      Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/21/01 =

ay not have been a perfect solution, but it was tolerable.  Thank goodness =

t of this world.  In fact, Mark Dochtermann, technical director for publish=

* Financial Summary

Paradise is a music and entertainment company that is in the process
of a significant restructuring effort, spearheaded by noted
turnaround specialist Kelly Hickel and a new senior management
team.  PDSE is focused on producing and owning state-of-the art
events, film, video, digital and music-related products through its
three groups -Paradise Film & Television, Paradise Music, and
Paradise Festivals & Events.  Paradise's new strategy is to leverage
its integrated creative services and global corporate relationships to
create unique entertainment products which deliver corporate clients'
branding messages to targeted demographic audiences.

The following are a summary of Results of Operations for the Three
Months Ended June 30, 2001 Compared to Three Months Ended
June 30, 2000.  In aggregate, revenues for the three months ended
June 30, 2001 increased to $7,765,268 or 26% compared to
revenues of $6,164,769 in the three-month period ended June 30,
2000.  The net loss was $9,376,245 for the three months ended
June 30, 2001 compared to $2,047,658 for the three months ended
June 30, 2000.  The loss for the three months ended June 30, 2001
included a provision for goodwill impairment of $7,268,586.

Notwithstanding the goodwill impairment provision, the former
Commercial group incurred a loss in the period of $1,003,366,
almost entirely in the Straw Dogs affiliate, reflective of the severe
downturn in the advertising industry.  Additionally, the Company
incurred $414,762 of non-recurring costs relating to the iball merger
and business restructuring.  Exclusive of the provision for goodwill
impairment, the non-recurring costs relating to the iball merger and
business restructuring and the significant loss incurred in the PDSE
Commercial Group (mainly Straw Dogs), the Paradise adjusted net
loss for the current three month period would have been $689,531,
compared with a net loss of $1,576,406 (adjusted for the PDSE
Commercial segments loss in the prior period).  PDSE Commercial
Group revenues increased to $5,591,439 for the three months ended
June 30, 2001, from $3,464,044 for the three months ended June
30, 2000, an increase of $2,127,395 or 61%.  The increase in
revenues is primarily due to the negative impact of the SAG strike
on last year's activity.

* Analyst Summary

The entertainment industry has traditionally shown strong growth
through all manner of economic downturn and periods of
uncertainty.  When World War II started, Major League Baseball
had many of its stars go off to war and was considering canceling
play until urged by President Roosevelt to continue, because it was
something that America needed.  During the Great Depression,
people found enough money to go to Movie Theaters, because they
could ""get-away"" for a while.  We believe that PDSE represents a
value and in the long run an attractive takeover candidate.

Paradise has been very active in the last quarter constructing a
foundation built on a renewed focus on certain high-end niches in
the music and entertainment industry and moves into certain
fragmented, high-margin markets.  We believe these activities will
sustain growth in the months to come.  A renowned creative team
and a new senior management team with extensive turnaround
experience are keys to this success.  Given its price and
performance, we feel PDSE will be a solid play on the small-cap
entertainment field.

COMMENT: On December 5, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan spoke. He said that the
""wealth effect"" has been ""significantly attenuated"" thanks to the drop in
stock prices. He also acknowledges that our economy ""is obviously at
increased risk of untoward events.."" He is right, of course, and in a
position to reduce this risk by easing monetary policy. Ironically, his
latest speech follows by exactly four years the one in which the Fed
Chairman famously asked, "".how do we know when irrational exuberance has
unduly escalated asset values.""

More and more these days, I hear from various well-connected business
sources that sales ""fell off a cliff"" since the summer. This is confirmed by
the steep drop in consumer confidence during the first half of December and
Intel's warning last week about sudden order cancellations. Despite this
warning, large/mid/small cap tech stocks were up last week by 8.1%, 15.2%,
and 9.9%, respectively. Could it be that the bad news is mostly in stocks
and that the market is starting to anticipate Fed easing soon? I think so.

SUBSCRIBERS: The risk is that Fed easing might not work to avert a recession
this time. This ""pushing-on-a-string"" fear was frequently raised by Asian
investors, who I met last week in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Many of
my friends in Japan see lots of disturbing parallels in the US today with
their unhappy economic and financial experience during the previous decade.
I reminded them that there are still 650 basis points left between the
federal funds rate and zero. For more on this subject, see my latest GLOBAL
PORTFOLIO STRATEGY. The topic for Monday's WEEKLY AUDIO FORUM: ""Will US
follow Japan's bubble script?""

PUBLIC: You can decide for yourself whether it is too late for Fed officials
to avert a recession, and how quickly they can get us out once they start to
ease by tracking numerous KEY WEEKLY indicators on the HOME page. You'll
find initial jobless claims, bank credit, mortgage applications, and more.
In his latest speech, the Fed Chairman said he still believes that the
secular rebound in productivity growth is intact. I agree. You can find his
speech in the GREENSPAN CENTER and our updated (Dec 6) PRODUCTIVITY TRENDS
chart book on the WHAT'S NEW page.

Morning Watch List
This section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days. 
Click here for this morning's Watch List Stocks: http://www.realtimetraders.com/marketinfo/watchlist.asp Beyond The Numbers
Extreme optimism drove tech stocks higher
Thursday tech stocks and the market as a whole started to rally on favorable 
news from the semiconductor sector. First the Semiconductor Industry 
association said the future demand for semiconductors would be strong 
despite the drop in the book-to-bill ratio. Following that announcement 
National Semiconductor said it is starting to see improvements as some of its 
major customers are starting to place orders again. This news combined with 
Monday's positive comments from Xilinx Inc. (XLNX) propelled the 
semiconductor sector higher. Another factor that helped the index move higher 
was the anticipation of more favorable comments from industry leader Intel 
Corporation (INTC) after the close. Intel finished the regular session higher 
by $1.32 to close at $31.14. 
Just as traders expected after the close Intel said it expects to meet earnings 
estimates. While they were not really positive comments, investors were happy 
to hear the company was not warning. As a result traders drove the stock even 
higher in the after-hours session. Shares of Intel traded as high as $32.85 on 1 
million shares in the Island ECN. Despite the fact Intel did not warn, Merrill Lynch 
is cautious on the stock. Taking a closer look at today's comments,  
RealTimeTraders analysts are not very positive on the stock as well. It seems 
Intel really painted a mixed picture as the company said it expects revenue to be 
slightly below the midpoint of the previous guidance range given on April 17th. 
The company went on to say it sees stability in the microprocessor business 
and weakness in its communications related businesses. Readers may want to 
watch the analyst comments and rating/estimate changes on Friday. 
When Thursday's session came to a close, the semiconductor index had risen 
7.7% and closed above the 200 day moving average for the first time in more 
than 7months. While it was a broad based rally, some of the veteran traders 
expressed concern over the fact stocks such as Broadcom Corporation climbed 
$4.67 after warning that its earnings will fall short of expectations. It is also worth 
mentioning the company is expecting sales to drop by a whopping 35% below its 
first quarter number. It seems as though investors and traders have decided to 
selectively focus only on the positive news, and ignore all the negatives.
On the economic front, the government reported jobless claims rose to a 
multi-year high. Analysts had expected the number to come in around 417K, 
but the actual number was 432K. Not only did this number beat the estimates, 
but it also beat the previous week's 419K number by a wide margin. 
RealTimeTraders analysts believe this could cause some problem for the 
ailing economy. 
In our opinion, the slowing economy combined with increasing unemployment 
spells trouble for the economy. While we believe the rebate from the tax cut is 
a good thing for the economy, in our view it alone may not be enough to help 
the economy recover. It is also our opinion the longer the slowdown lasts, the 
harder it will be to recover. Under the current circumstances we believe the 
Federal Reserve may consider another rate cut to boost the economy at the 
next FOMC meeting on June 26th and 27th. Ahead of the meeting markets and 
analysts will be watching the economic reports closely for any clues to determine 
if the recent rate cuts have started to help the economy. 
We at RealTimeTraders continue to believe earnings will be the driving force 
in the near-term. In our opinion the companies that manage to deliver strong 
earnings in this difficult environment will emerge as the leaders when the 
economy and markets starts to improve. 
Sector Analysis
Retailers are experiencing a significant slowdown
Thursday the markets received retail sales figures for the month of May. 
Most of the retailers reported significant declines in same store sales, which 
surprised investors and analysts alike. Many analysts had argued the rising 
consumer confidence and lower interest rates should improve sales for the 
retailers. Thursday morning the retail sector gapped down, but regained all 
its losses and closed higher by 1.2%. Which once again illustrates that traders 
and investors are too optimistic and are ignoring the facts. Some of the 
companies that announced negative results in this sector include The Limited 
Inc. (LTD), Gap Inc. (GPS), Federated Dept Stores (FD) and American Eagle 
Outfitters (AEOS).

Broadcom Unveils World's First Gigabit Ethernet Controller with Support
for PCI-X Standard=0F=3DBCM5700 Demonstrates Higher Performance and Lower C=
PU
Utilization Than Any Other Commercially Available Solution

IRVINE, Calif., Dec 11, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Broadcom Corporation
(Nasdaq:BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadba=
nd
communications, today extended its leadership position in Gigabit Ethernet=
=20
with
the introduction of the world's first Gigabit Ethernet Media Access Control=
ler
(MAC) chip that supports Peripheral Computer Interconnect (PCI) and PCI-X=
=20
local
bus interfaces for use in network interface cards (NIC) and LAN-on-Motherbo=
ard
(LOM) implementations.

The company's first Gigabit Ethernet MAC, the Broadcom(R) BCM5700, which co=
mes
with a comprehensive suite of software, sets a new standard in the industry=
=20
for
performance and on-chip integration. Broadcom's high performance 10/100/100=
0
BASE-T MAC is complemented by its broad family of Gigabit Ethernet transcei=
ver
chips and will enable the company to provide customers with complete
MAC/transceiver solutions that will drive down the cost of Gigabit Ethernet=
 in
next-generation servers, workstations, and desktop computers. Furthermore,
Broadcom's strategic alliance announced today with 3Com Corporation, the mo=
st
preferred brand and channel for network interface cards and LOM networking
solutions, will further accelerate customer migration from Fast Ethernet to
Gigabit Ethernet.

""By delivering leading edge MAC, transceiver and software technology with
unprecedented levels of integration, Broadcom is driving up performance whi=
le
driving down the price points to enable widespread adoption of Gigabit
Ethernet,"" said Marty Colombatto, Vice President and General Manager of
Broadcom's Networking Business Unit. ""Broadcom's initiative to develop Giga=
bit
MAC technology is strategic to our overall commitment to deliver to our
customers the highest level of integration and performance for the advancem=
ent
of corporate networks.""

Broadcom's first generation Gigabit Ethernet controller provides an
unprecedented level of integration, combining support for 10/100/1000 Megab=
it
per second (Mbps) operation, dual high-speed on-chip processors, 128KB of
integrated on-chip memory, advanced packet classification engines, and PCI
/PCI-X 1.0 local bus interconnects in a single-chip solution. Triple speed=
=20
(10,
100, and 1000 Mbps) support with standard-based auto-negotiation allows=20
server,
workstation and desktop computer manufacturers to build solutions that can
transparently interface with Ethernet, Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet
technology over the existing Category 5 cabling infrastructure, and provide=
s=20
an
easy path for migrating legacy 10 Mbps and 10/100 Mbps networks to Gigabit
speed.

The BCM5700 is the industry's first Gigabit MAC to incorporate the recently
approved PCI-X v1.0 local bus interface specification allowing data transfe=
r
rates of up to 1.066 Gigabytes per second between the controller and the=20
system.
Support for PCI-X enables Broadcom's Gigabit Ethernet MAC to maintain traff=
ic=20
at
Gigabit speeds in I/O intensive server applications where multiple=20
communication
and storage peripheral devices share the same I/O bus. Broadcom's support f=
or
the new PCI-X interface demonstrates the company's commitment to delivering
leading edge I/O technology for servers and workstations.

According to Bert McComas, analyst for InQuest Market research, ""By the mid=
dle
of 2001, we expect that PCI-X will be enabled in new mainstream server=20
platforms
from all leading server vendors. PCI-X builds on the momentum of PCI as the=
=20
most
widely supported I/O standard in the world, and defines a clear path to=20
satisfy
next generation server I/O performance demands.""

Gigabit Ethernet provides ten times the performance of today's 10/100 BASE-=
T
server, workstation, and desktop network connections. This leap forward in
performance is especially critical for today's servers and workstations tha=
t=20
are
already being bottlenecked by aging 10/100 Ethernet connections. With Inter=
net
traffic doubling every three to six months, accelerating the performance an=
d
communication speed of the server is critical for enhancing end-users'=20
Internet
and e-Business experience.

Early tests show the BCM5700 raises the bar for the competition in both
throughput and host CPU efficiency. By focusing on total performance of the
system, the architecture of the BCM5700 enables servers and workstations no=
t
only to communicate faster but also to reduce the consumption of valuable=
=20
system
resources needed to reach Gigabit communications speeds.

PCI-X is an extension of the widely accepted PCI standard for data transfer
between CPUs and I/O peripherals and is becoming widely used by manufacture=
rs
for speeding the flow of data within servers, storage area networks and=20
network
switches. Backwards compatible with the high performance PCI local bus
specification, PCI-X offers an immediate solution to the increased I/O
requirements for high-bandwidth applications such as Gigabit Ethernet, Fibr=
e
Channel, Ultra3 SCSI and high-performance graphics. PCI-X supports 32-bit a=
nd
64-bit operations at frequencies up to 133 MHz, allowing data throughput of=
=20
over
1 Gigabyte per second.

Broadcom also offers the most complete suite of software for server=20
applications
supporting all leading operating systems. This software suite is already
undergoing extensive system-level qualification by leading server OEMs.
Broadcom's server software package includes multi-vendor fail-over, IEEE=20
802.3AD
port aggregation, Layer 3 switch-independent Smart-Load-Balancing(TM),=20
Hot-Plug
PCI, IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging, and IEEE 802.1P traffic prioritization for
Quality of Service (QoS), cable analyzer, and advanced diagnostics and cont=
rol
functions. The combined BCM5700 MAC and server software solution demonstrat=
es
superior functionality to any other Gigabit Ethernet NIC or LOM solution
commercially available today.

A complete NIC and LOM solution is achieved by combining the BCM5700 with o=
ne=20
of
Broadcom's market leading Gigabit Ethernet transceivers, which support the=
=20
three
Ethernet speeds - 10, 100, and 1000 Mbps - in a single-chip solution with
intelligent networking functions, such as cable diagnostics and auto networ=
k
detection. Having shipped over a million Gigabit Ethernet ports, Broadcom
continues to extend its leadership position in Gigabit Ethernet, with the
broadest, most advanced family of Gigabit Ethernet transceivers. Broadcom's
Gigabit Ethernet transceiver architecture is the only solution that has bee=
n
proven in actual high-volume field deployment. Furthermore, Broadcom's Giga=
bit
Ethernet transceiver architecture has completed over eighteen months of
extensive system- and device-level testing in real-world and ""worse-case""=
=20
cable
plants by hundreds of engineers in dozens of test sites worldwide.


Pricing and Availability

Broadcom's Gigabit Ethernet MAC and Phy chipset solution is available now a=
nd=20
is
priced at $59.

AMCC First to Enable the Next Generation Multi-Carrier, Transparent
Network Architecture With Introduction of 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper and FEC
Device=0F=3DAMCC's Hudson is the Industry's First Device to Meet the Rapidl=
y=20
Growing
Demand for 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper Solutions From the Man, Transport and WD=
M
Sectors

SAN DIEGO, Dec 11, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AM=
CC)
(Nasdaq:AMCC), a leader in high-bandwidth silicon connectivity solutions fo=
r=20
the
world's optical networks, today announced the Hudson (S19203), the industry=
's
first 10 Gbps silicon device architected to support both the evolving G.709
digital wrapper standard and traditional SONET/SDH infrastructures.

The Hudson variable rate, digital wrapper framer/deframer and performance
monitor device facilitates the transparent transport of multiple protocols
across the network, while aiding interconnection between multiple carriers.
Hudson incorporates programmable Forward Error Correction (FEC) for rates u=
p=20
to
10.66 Gbps and supports OC-192 transmission standards. The digital wrapper
technology provides an extension of the current SONET/SDH infrastructure,=
=20
while
enhancing both flexibility and transparency across the network. The Hudson
easily interfaces with AMCC's 10 Gbps mux/demux devices, SONET/SDH/digital
wrapper backplane devices and AMCC's mapping and pointer processing devices=
.

""The digital wrapper is the next important step for large optical networks =
as=20
it
incorporates the best features of SONET/SDH while removing some of the rigi=
d
overhead structure that makes SONET/SDH sub-optimal for an IP-centric,
intelligent optical network,"" said Brent Little, vice president of marketin=
g=20
for
AMCC. ""By using key devices such as Hudson, OEMs will now be able to create=
=20
more
efficient and interoperable systems without starting from scratch.""

AMCC's digital wrapper design has already been adopted by most of the major=
=20
wide
area networking (WAN) equipment manufacturers. The demand for digital wrapp=
er
products stems from the need in the WAN to transparently transport multiple
protocols at 10 Gbps, coupled with the need to efficiently provision bandwi=
dth
across today's multiple-carrier network.

""The Hudson is built for the next-generation multi-carrier transport networ=
k
architecture and ushers in an efficient and cost-effective means of=20
transporting
traffic while extending existing SONET infrastructures,"" said Ken Prentiss,
AMCC's director of marketing for telecom products. ""We are seeing=20
unprecedented
demand for Hudson across a large customer base due mainly to the device's
flexible architecture; customers can wrap, unwrap or monitor traditional
SONET/SDH traffic, or wrap and unwrap IP or any other traffic using a singl=
e
device.""

The digital wrapper concept involves grouping together a number of existing
frames into ""super-frames,"" which can then be more efficiently managed with=
 a
relatively small allocation of overhead-per-byte of data. By aggregating
together the provisions for ""framing bits"" that are already defined for use=
 by
existing time-division multiplexed (TDM) structures, the super-frame concep=
t
allows for the implementation of an intelligent operation, administration a=
nd
maintenance (OAM) capability without materially expanding the amount of dat=
a
currently being transmitted. This creative use of available control bits al=
so
allows FEC functions to be very efficiently incorporated within the digital
wrapper definition without a significant net increase in overall bandwidth
usage.

The Hudson's core logic runs on a 1.8V power supply and features two input =
and
two output ports, which are configurable in many ways. Figure 1 shows a=20
typical
network application supporting a single data stream with dual redundant inp=
ut
and output lines. The input and output ports can be configured as a dual
redundant I/O on a single data stream for protection switching or as two
completely independent data streams for duplex operation. Either input port=
=20
can
be directly connected to either output port for loopback testing.

The Hudson provides full digital wrapper performance monitoring and feature=
s
Optical Channel Overhead (OCh-OH) insertion and extraction, which are
independently controllable. All 64 OCh-OH bytes in a superframe are=20
programmable
in function and are available for insertion from and drop to FPGA or
microprocessor. Data entering and leaving the Hudson device can be optional=
ly
differentially decoded and encoded, deframed and framed, descrambled and
scrambled, and decoded and encoded with FEC information. In addition, SONET=
=20
data
can optionally be performance monitored for integrity, alarms, and trace
messages.


Pricing and Availability

The Hudson (S19203), packaged in a 624-pin CBGA, will be sampling to=20
development
partners in December with volume production commencing in Q2 2001. AMCC=20

Previous Session's Best Performing Alert

One of Friday's Before the Bell Alerts Emulex Corp. (EMLX) gained=20
17 points after our alert. RealTimeTraders.com offers free=20
real-time stock alerts throughout the day. Why pay for=20
chat rooms and stock pickers for old news?



Morning Watch List

This section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days.=20
Click here for this morning's Watch List Stocks:=20
http://www.realtimetraders.com/realtimetraders/marketinfo/watchlist.asp



Beyond The Numbers

Are the markets ready for a rally?

Whether the markets are ready for a bounce or a sustainable rally is a topi=
c=20
that can probably be argued for a long time to come. Some may argue the=20
fundamentals may or may not be in place for a reversal. While others may=20
argue the markets are due for a bounce because of the oversold condition.=
=20
Then there are those few, including RealTimeTraders.com who believe it's a=
=20
good idea not to fight the markets and simply go with the flow.

Important factors may be coming together for a move up

Notice, our heading states =01&a move up=018 rather than a rally. Along wit=
h a few=20
market analysts we are not so sure this move up will be a definite reversal=
=20
or a temporary bounce that many traders are looking for in next few session=
s.=20
Last week we pointed out that Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan finally ga=
ve=20
the markets what they had been anticipating. His favorable comments were=20
interpreted to be a sign of possible lowering of interest rates to help the=
=20
economy from slowing down to undesirable growth levels.

Last Friday Labor Department announced the November employment numbers were=
=20
below the consensus estimates. Over the weekend we learned that Iraq will b=
e=20
back in the crude oil market. If Iraq's crude comes online, that may furthe=
r=20
pressure the crude oil prices, (which is in the best interest of US=20
consumers). The fact this election drama is also getting close to an end is=
=20
also a positive for the markets. All the above facts coupled with the usual=
=20
year end rally (better known as Santa Claus rally) may set the stage for a=
=20
meaningful move up in the last few weeks of the year 2000.=20

Economic slowdown may impact future earnings

Last week some of the biggest and well-known names warned their upcoming=20
quarterly earnings will fall short of Wall Street=01,s expectations. Despit=
e the=20
earnings warnings, markets have started to rally on the FED Chairman=01,s=
=20
comments about possibly lowering interest rates to stimulate or stop the=20
economy from slowing down. While lower rates are expected to help the marke=
ts=20
move higher, it is important to note that corporate earnings will not=20
immediately start to move higher. Given that, we believe markets are likely=
=20
to move in a range for some time before starting to pick up pace. Moreover,=
=20
unlike the past when dot com businesses rocketed higher and higher despite=
=20
losing more money, stock prices in the future will depend a lot on the=20
companies future earnings.=20
<br><br>
We encourage our readers to take a closer look at companies' earnings power=
=20
and their position within the sector. What we mean by that is, it is a good=
=20
idea to stay with the leaders in each sector rather than any stock that is=
=20
moving higher, a good example of that is Applied Materials (AMAT) within th=
e=20
semiconductor sector. Applied Materials is the strongest stock in the=20
Semiconductor equipment world, and as such it has always produced steady an=
d=20
predictable earnings.



Sector Analysis

Healthcare and Insurance related Stocks continue to attract  money

Once again we like to stay with stocks that are outperforming the broad=20
market. Past few months we have been pointing out health and food related=
=20
stocks that are among the defensive stocks that has caught the interest of=
=20
investors. We at RealTimeTraders.com believe the healthcare and insurance=
=20
related stocks will continue to move higher regardless of the possibility o=
f=20
technology stocks coming back into the spotlight. Some of the stocks that a=
re=20
worth mentioning are United Healthcare (UNH) has been hovering around its=
=20
52-week high for the past few weeks. Friday the stock closed at a new 52-we=
ek=20
on average volume. Allstate Corp. (ALL) closed at a new 52-week high on=20
Friday for the fourth consecutive day. Oxford Healthcare (OXHP) has set=20
series of new highs since we started to alert our readers to this stock bac=
k=20
in May 2000. We continue to see positive money flow into this stock.=20




Economic Reports & Bond Markets

=20
economic reports that will help economist determine the direction and the=

Despite an onslaught of earnings warnings from tech  companies lately, the 
consensus expectation for Oracle (ORCL) is for  at least a penny earnings 
surprise and possibly a two-cent positive  surprise.

Bert Hochfeld at Josephthal & Co., one of the more accurate  analysts 
following Oracle, is one of two analysts that have an official earnings  
estimate of $0.11 per share. Mr. Hochfeld told clients recently that the 
company  would meet his expectations with strong U.S. sales offset by 
disappointing  European sales.?

The consensus among the 28 analysts is for Oracle  to earn $0.10 per share on 
revenue of just under $2.7 billion, yet even the more  conservative analysts 
are optimistic. Gretchen Teagarden at Salomon Smith Barney  is one of the few 
analysts with an estimate below $0.10 per share, but her  revenue estimate is 
slightly above the consensus revenue estimate.

On  Tuesday Chris Shilakes at Merrill Lynch told clients that he is 
projecting  earnings of $0.10 per share on revenue of $2.68 billion. However, 
he added that  revenue might be slightly better than his projections and 
Oracle's continued  improvement with operating margins should lead to 
earnings of $0.11 to $0.12 per  share.?

Last week Jim Pickrel at Chase H & Q told clients that  he expects the 
company to meet or beat his earnings estimate of $0.10 per share  and revenue 
estimate of $2.6 billion. He stated that Oracle's ""pipeline appears  robust"" 
and that the company should achieve 52% revenue growth or better in its  
applications business.

The pressing issues regarding Oracle among the  analysts are next quarter and 
the recent management turnover. Mr. Pickrel stated  Oracle's Senior Vice 
President Gary Bloom's departure would not have much of an  impact, but 
turnover in other key management positions is an issue. Yet, the  recent pact 
with CitiGroup (C) adds some  confidence in the current team. Richard Davis 
at Needham & Co. told clients  recently that this quarter would be fine but 
still downgraded Oracle's stock  because of the departure of Bloom and Senior 
Vice President Ray Lane reduces the  company's earnings visibility and may 
encourage others to leave the company as  well.

Mr. Upin said that Oracle could have a tough February quarter and  could see 
its toughest test of its performance in the applications space in the  May 
quarter. Yet, overall the analysts like the stock and believe the recent  
stock price is a buying opportunity.?

As result, the company will  need to at least meet or beat the $0.11 Earnings 
Whisper number and provide the  analysts comfort with the current management 
team and the upcoming quarters. If  this can be accomplished during the 
conference call on Thursday, some analysts  believe the stock could reach $35 
in the very near term. You may listen to  Oracle's conference call at 
http://www.nasdaq.com/reference/broadcast_oracle.htm  beginning at 5:30 PM ET 
on Thursday.

Previous Session's Best Performing Alert

One of Tuesday's Short Trader Alert Ariba, Inc. (ARBA) lost 7 1/16=20
points after our alert. RealTimeTraders.com offers free=20
real-time stock alerts throughout the day. Why pay for=20
chat rooms and stock pickers for old news?



Morning Watch List

This section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days.=20
Click here for this morning's Watch List Stocks:=20
http://www.realtimetraders.com/realtimetraders/marketinfo/watchlist.asp



Beyond The Numbers

When will the Election madness come to an end?

The U.S. presidential election was held 6-weeks ago. Since then=20
there has been plenty of speculation on who will be the next president=20
of United States. Each passing day this matter has gotten more=20
complicated causing the nation to become increasingly frustrated with=20
the entire situation. Traders convey the message that the financial =20
markets have reached a point where the outcome of this election, in =20
either direction, will have very little effect on the markets. As one=20
frustrated trader said =01&Mostly markets are looking for an end to this=20
matter, not many care at this point who the next president will be=018.=20
We believe the initial reaction to the outcome will be mixed. However,=20
as the cloud clears, markets should be able to find a clear direction=20
from there. As of Tuesday night it appears the Texas Governor=20
George Bush will most likely be the next president.=20

Even negative news is boosting stock prices

Just a few weeks ago, no news was good news for US financial=20
markets. Readers may recall even when there was positive news=20
announcements made by companies, stocks continued to trade=20
lower. However, in the past few trading sessions we have highlighted=20
many better-known names warnings about the upcoming quarterly=20
earnings and about their entire year=01,s outlook. Interestingly enough,=20
following the =01&bad =01&news most of these stocks have rallied to recover=
=20
some of the recent losses. We are still confused about this reaction=20
and trying to make sense of it all. This interesting development brings=20
back some important memories. Some time ago (12-15 months ago)=20
we pointed out that some of the better known money managers left=20
the business or were forced out because they too could not make=20
sense or understand what was taking place in the market back then.=20
Of course, the entire street is aware of what has happened to the=20
Nasdaq in last 8-months.?=20

Others with many decades of experience in the markets have voiced=20
similar opinions. Some of the smartest people in Wall Street like=20
Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Hedge fund manager Julian=20
H. Robertson, and fund manager George Soros also find it difficult=20
to make sense of the market reaction to the negative news. What's=20
puzzling is the fact these companies are steadily moving higher=20
despite the companies loosing money. We believe it is worth pointing=20
out or at least taking a closer look at before blindly joining the crowd.



Sector Analysis

Another big name warns

Tuesday after the close one of the better-known names in the PC world,=20
Compaq Computer (CPQ) warned the company=01,s earnings would fall=20
short of analysts=01, expectations. Following this earnings warning, the=20
box maker's stock briefly dipped down to $19=20
 before bouncing back =20
to finish the session around $20. Given this is the third box maker to=20
pre-announce negative earnings, it may be worth watching the=20
component manufacturers who make the parts that go into the=20
computers. Some of the tech stocks worth watching closely are disc=20
drive makers, memory producers, modem, network card/network=20
suppliers, audio/video and other component makers.=20

Dow Transports may stall around 3000

In the past few sessions we wrote about transportation stocks benefiting=20
from lower crude oil prices. Some of the best performers within the =20
sector were airlines and railroads. As we are approaching the critical=20
resistance level of 3000, we like to alert readers to watch for possible=20
profit taking. Tuesday Transportation index traded as high as 2,970 =20
before settling at 2,905. Tuesday=01,s move up put the index at a 7-month=
=20
high. If the crude oil prices stays around the current levels or move=20
lower, Transportation index may challenge the resistance level and=20
move higher if the markets as a whole moves higher.

2013,"InternetStudios Entertainment Finance Closes Film Financings

LOS ANGELES, Dec 13, 2000 -- InternetStudios.com, Inc. (OTCBB:ISTS), the
global filmed entertainment company that operates online, via its two main
sites OnlineFilmandTVSales.com and reportertv.com, is delighted to announce
that its newly created InternetStudios Entertainment Finance (""IEF"")
subsidiary, headed up by film financing specialist, Robert Beattie, has
already completed its first two transactions.

InternetStudios launched IEF in September to provide interim financing for
the production of films. IEF has already expanded by completing two deals to
finance and produce a series of motion pictures through the official
Czech-Canada production treaty. The pictures will be shot in Prague.

The inaugural film, Ariana's Quest, from North American Pictures and
Forgotten Kingdom Productions, stars female WWF Champion Rena Mero,
(formerly known as ""Sable""), and has recently gone into postproduction. As
part of the arrangements between IEF and the producers, this film will be
promoted and sold exclusively over the internet via
OnlineFilmandTVSales.com. The InternetStudios group of companies has also
retained the Internet rights to the picture for possible webcasts in the
future.

IEF has also signed a further agreement with North American Pictures and
North American Releasing to produce and finance several further independent
pictures, beginning with the action, adventure picture Omega Force, which
commences shooting in Prague during January 2001.


Rob Maclean, Chairman, InternetStudios comments:

""These transactions represent the beginning of the tremendous opportunities
that we have identified for IEF. We will continue to build our company based
on our focus of working with our clients to take advantage of a variety of
funding sources, including international tax motivated sources, foreign
subsidies and co-production treaties to ensure we fully maximize the
available financing for the producer and launch these productions in the
most financially efficient manner.

""Not only does IEF represent a further source of revenue to our company, it
also provides our clients with another source of product unique to
InternetStudios. These deals and the partnerships that Robert Beattie is
creating for this company through his vast banking experience and
international focus will contribute to the growth of InternetStudios and
benefit the international independent film industry.""

IEF works with producers and sales agents and makes available both
conventional and gap financing. The Company has relationships with a number
of private funding sources and significant institutional investors who
provide the necessary capital.

Bouncing On Bad News

By Chris Nerney

Internet ad services market leader DoubleClick wasn't the biggest gainer
Tuesday among members of internet.com's Internet Stock Index - that honor
belonged to PSINet, which soared 49% after announcing another round of
layoffs and on rumors that Sprint may be interested in buying the
beleaguered access provider.

But the fact that DCLK gained at all after issuing a warning for Q4 after
Monday's market close is almost shocking, given the current bearish
outlook for online advertising growth.

Surely no other Internet company is more vulnerable to a downturn in Web
ad spending than DoubleClick, whose business plan from Day One was based
on becoming the premiere provider of services for companies advertising on
the Internet.

DoubleClick certainly has achieved that goal, but the company still has no
profits to show for it. And with concerns about the future of online
advertising intensifying throughout the year as one 'Net firm after
another lowered their ad-revenue forecasts, DCLK has become one of the
biggest losers among large-cap 'Net players. Even with Tuesday's 16% gain
(to $13.88), DoubleClick is down 89% this year.

So why the post-warning spike? Perhaps investors feel DCLK shares already
have been discounted enough. With a market capitalization of $1.7 billion,
DoubleClick is valued at 3.2x trailing 12 months' revenue of $433 million.
Not a bad price for a company that dominates its sector.

Or it could be Wall Street expected worse than DoubleClick's Q4 advisory,
which warned that revenues will be 8% to 10% below expectations and that
the bottom line will range from break-even to a net loss of 3 cents per
share.

While those latter numbers may be well short of consensus Q4 estimates
calling for a net profit of 2 cents per share, they hardly are indicative
that the sky is falling on DoubleClick. Yet.

It looks as if investors will have to wait at least until April for
evidence that DoubleClick can turn a profit. Until then, don't expect many
days like Tuesday for DCLK shares.

Getting back to PSINet, its nearly 50% gain (or 53 cents) on Tuesday
helped slash its year-to-date loss to 94.7% from 96.5%. The layoff of 300
workers clearly is intended to help position the company for a sale. In
November, PSINet said it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic
options.

As a group, the 50 members of the Internet Stock Index, or ISDEX, gained
6% in the week of trading ended Tuesday, closing at 501. For the year, the
ISDEX has fallen 41.8%.

_____________________________________________________________________

The STOCK INDEXES The Nasdaq and S&P's posted inside days with lower
closes. Light pressure came from some negative pre- announcements on
earnings in tech stocks that led to today's consolidation. The March
S&P is consolidating just below trendline resistance crossing near
1410. The March Nasdaq has broken out above this fall's downtrend
line crossing near 2900 thereby hinting a bottom and trend change may
be in place. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling sideways to
higher prices in both markets are possible near-term. Meanwhile, the
Dow closed modestly higher as it extends its rebound off last
Thursday's low. Closes above 10,917.30 are needed to extend this
month's rebound into the end of the year.

INTEREST RATES March bonds closed modestly higher on the day due to a
late-session short covering rebound triggered by today's decline in
the Nasdaq. Trading remains choppy, as the market is nervous over the
much-anticipated ruling by the Supreme Court that should decide the
outcome of the U.S. Presidential election. March bonds are
challenging November's uptrend line crossing near 102- 28. Multiple
closes below this support level would all but confirm a top and trend
change has taken place. Closes above last week's high at 104 are
needed to resume the late-fall rally.

CRB INDEX closed sharply lower on Tuesday pressured by weakness in
heating oil, unleaded gas, cotton, foods, and grains. The CRB has
been range bound following last Monday's strong rally and appears to
be forming a possible symmetrical triangle. A breakout in either
direction of this consolidation pattern should lead to a trending
move in the direction of the breakout. Momentum indicators are
neutral to bearish warning traders that a broad double top with
October's high also appears to be forming.

ENERGIES The energy markets closed mixed on Tuesday as February crude
oil closed slightly higher while the product markets were lower
following the release of bearish API (American Petroleum Institute)
data, which showed gasoline and distillate stocks including heating
oil building. Nevertheless, the oversold condition of the energy
complex has left the doors open for a short covering rebound into the
end of the year especially if Iraq continues its oil embargo while
negotiating over price with the United Nations. Look for sideways to
lower price action on Wednesday.

CURRENCIES the March Dollar closed slightly lower on Tuesday due to
light profit taking as it consolidated some of its gains off last
week's low. Nevertheless, momentum indicators are oversold and
turning neutral to bullish signaling sideways to higher prices into
the end of the year are possible. The March Swiss Franc and D-mark
closed steady to slightly higher due to light short covering on
Tuesday. However, today's poor closes leave the doors open for
sideways to lower prices near-term as both markets appear to have
posted short-term tops with last week's highs. The March Japanese Yen
closed lower on Tuesday after opening under pressure. Concerns over
the Japanese economy and uncertainty over the U.S. Presidential race
triggered today's sell off in the yen. Closes below .9088 would renew
this fall's decline and set the stage for a test of weekly support
crossing at .8978 later this winter.

PRECIOUS METALS were closed mixed on Tuesday. February gold posted a
quiet inside day due to light short covering as it consolidated some
of its recent losses. However, today's mid-range close leaves the
door open for a resumption of the decline off last week's high.
Closes below trendline support crossing near 271.80 would confirm
this fall's rebound has likely come to an end. March silver extended
Monday's short covering rally. However, early gains faded into the
close hinting this week's bounce has likely come to an end. March
silver is poised to renew its decline off last week's high with
November's lows at 4.69 cents being the next target. March copper
closed lower on Tuesday following Monday's spike above the 62%
retracement level of this fall's decline, which crosses at 89.47.
Closes below November's uptrend line crossing near 87.50 would all
but confirm the late-fall rebound has come to an end. Momentum
indicators are overbought and turning neutral to bearish with today's
loss.

GRAINS closed lower on Tuesday. March corn closed fractionally lower
in relatively quiet trading following this morning's neutral supply
and demand report. The USDA lowered its export projection by 75
million bushels to 2.2 billion bushels. The also raised ending stocks
by the same amount to 1.754 billion bushels. These changes were
widely anticipated by the market. Momentum indicators remain bearish
signaling March corn is likely to drift sideways to lower into the
end of the year. Bulls are hopeful that the Starlink issue will be
resolved by then, which should lead to an increase in foreign demand
after the first of the year. March wheat also closed lower on Tuesday
despite today's surprise increase in this year's export projection by
the USDA. Expectations for lower production in Australia and Europe
led to the increase. Carryout was also cut from 892 to 862 million
bushels. However, spillover weakness from soybeans and meal was
enough of a reason to trigger the late-session sell off. March is
challenging trading range support crossing at 2.69. Closes below this
support level could lead to a test of Sept.'s low at 2.63 1/2 and
possibly long-term support at 2.50 later this winter.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed mixed on Tuesday. January beans finished the
day on the minus side despite today's increase in U.S. export
projections. The USDA raised export sales for this year from 950 to
975 million bushels and lowered carryout by 30 million bushels to 320
million bushels. January beans are consolidating around fib
resistance crossing at 5.10 3/4. The rising ADX signals sideways to
higher prices near-term are possible. If the post-harvest rally
continues, the fall high at 5.25 is a target. January soybean meal
extended its rebound off last Friday's low following today's friendly
supply and demand report. The USDA raised its export project some
200,000 tons to 7,300 million tons for the year. The increase was due
entirely to the expected increase of meal demand from Europe due to
the recent ban on meat and bone meal in animal feed. While light
profit taking is possible on Wednesday to consolidate some of this
week's gains. The door remains open for sideways to higher prices
into the end of the year. January bean oil closed lower on Tuesday
following today's bearish supply and demand report. The USDA raised
ending stocks from 2.145 to 2.250 billion pounds and lowered export
projections from 1.650 to 1.550 billion pounds. Additional weakness
on Wednesday would set the stage for a test of November's low at
14.64 later this month.

LIVESTOCK closed mixed on Tuesday. February hogs closed lower as
locals faded the funds who are holding sizable long positions.
Additional pressure came from light profit taking following Monday's
spike of the previous contract high. At the same time, cash and pork
cut out values continue to climb due to adverse weather conditions
across the Midwest. Momentum indicators are overbought and diverging,
which is often a precursor to a top and trend change. Closes below
trendline support crossing near 57.40 are needed before this is
confirmed. February cattle posted a key reversal up as it surged to
new highs for the month amid higher boxed-beef prices and
expectations for $76-77 cash bids later this week. Additional support
came from aggressive buying from a believed to be large northwestern
U.S. cattle feeder. February cattle are poised to test long-term
resistance crossing at 77.92 possibly on Wednesday.

FOOD & FIBER markets were mixed on Tuesday. March coffee drifted
lower in choppy trading on Tuesday amidst a bearish weather forecast
for this weekend across Brazil. A short covering bounce ahead of the
close tempered some of today's losses leaving the door open for a
short covering bounce on Wednesday. March cocoa extended this week's
decline and spiked below November's low at 713 before a short
covering bounce tempered some of today's losses. Today's high-range
close leaves the door open for additional short covering on Wednesday
however, the door is open for a test of psychological support
crossing at 700. March sugar posted an inside day with a lower close
due to a lack of fresh news in the cash market. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling sideways to lower prices into the end of the
year are possible. If the decline resumes, 930 is the next target.
March cotton gapped down and closed sharply lower following today's
bearish supply and demand report. The USDA pegged U.S. production at
17.4 million bales down from last month's estimate of 17.51 million
bales. However, the USDA also raised world ending stocks from 35.10
to 35.69 million bales due to lower demand. Today's gap down and
close below the July/October uptrend line confirms a broad double top
has been posted. The door is open for additional weakness and a
possible test of October's low crossing at 63.75 later this winter.

Cheap Tickets, Cheap Shares

By Chris Nerney

It's an e-tailer that still derives most of its revenue from non-Internet
sources, which, along with the amusing ads featuring William Shatner,
might explain why it has gotten less publicity (or notoriety) than chief
competitor priceline.com.

But though Cheap Tickets may have no high-profile celebrity pitching its
low air fares and hotel rooms, the Hawaii-based company does have one
thing for which priceline.com and its investors would no doubt pay dearly:
profits.

In fact, CTIX has run in the black for seven straight quarters, the most
recent (Q3) showing net income of $4.3 million, or 18 cents per share, on
revenues of $121.4 million.

In contrast, priceline.com, with much higher revenues of $341 million in
the third quarter, turned in a loss of $199 million, or $1.19 per share.
Last Thursday, the troubled ""name your price"" e-tailer announced yet
another round of layoffs and the cancellation of plans to expand its
services.

And while PCLN has been one of the biggest busts among 'Net stocks this
year - down 95% through Monday's trading, despite surging up 30% after
last week's news - Cheap Tickets shares have declined by only about
one-third since Dec. 31, closing Monday at $8.75.

Which could mean there's more downside coming for CTIX. However, the
company's highly favorable valuation should provide enough buoyancy to
prevent much more stock-price erosion. With a market capitalization of
$218 million, Cheap Tickets is valued at 0.5x trailing 12 months' revenue
of $416.5 million. That's the best revenue-multiple valuation I've ever
seen among profitable Internet companies.

Of course, as mentioned earlier, Cheap Tickets really isn't a pure
Internet play. Begun in 1986, the company's prime business - which
accounts for 94% of sales - is to purchase non-published air fares from
the carriers and re-sell them at a discount to consumers. Up until 1997,
all of its sales came through four call centers and a dozen retail
outlets.

This changed in 1997, when CTIX launched its cheaptickets.com Web site. By
last year's third quarter, 27% of sales came via the Internet. That
increased to 37.4%, or $45.4 million, in the recent third quarter.

Further, while Internet-based revenues are rising both on a dollar and
percentage basis, call center and retail revenues actually are declining
on a dollar basis as the company focuses more on the Web, a strategy shift
that has been accompanied by higher gross margins.

All of the above are good reasons to expect CTIX shares to rise. Now
here's why I don't expect them to rise too far.

The main problem is a severe slowdown in revenue growth. Sales in the
recent third quarter were just 10% above last year's Q3, down from Q2's
25% year-over-year revenue increase, which was way below the 65% increase
in first-quarter sales. Granted, the increase in Internet-based revenue
for Q3 was 53% over the year-ago period, but even that number isn't
eye-catching among 'Net investors.

Then there's the threat of competition, including Hotwire.com, a discount
travel Web site start-up that is being supported by a six major airlines.
Other airlines also should be expected to get more directly involved in
selling unsold and unpublished air fares, a trend will put even more
pressure on Cheap Tickets to develop other revenue sources.

With viable options for 'Net investors seemingly shrinking on a daily
basis, Cheap Tickets is definitely worth a look. It is profitable and its
shares affordable, which bodes well should a larger player eventually
scoop up the company.

E X T R E M E   M A R K E T   C O M M E N T A R Y
_____________________________________________________________________

The STOCK INDEXES The Nasdaq and S&P's extended last week's short
covering rally on ideas that all of the bad news about earnings has
been discounted into the markets. Additional support came from ideas
that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2001. The Nasdaq
spiked above this fall's downtrend line crossing near 2950 on Monday.
Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to confirm a
breakout and trend change has taken place. Meanwhile, the rally in
tech stocks helped pull the broader market higher on the day. Closes
above last week's high crossing at 10,917.30 would open the door for
a possible test of last spring's high crossing at 11,425.40.

INTEREST RATES March bonds posted a inside day with a lower close as
it consolidated some of last week's gains. Light pressure came from
today's rebound in the equity markets. Stochastics and RSI are
bullish but becoming overbought warning traders that a short- term
top may be in or near. Closes below November's uptrend line crossing
near 102-24 would signal a top and trend change has taken place.

CRB INDEX closed higher on Monday led by gains in energies, some
foods, and fiber. The CRB continues to consolidate below this fall's
high of 234.38. Closes above this resistance level or below the
late-November reaction low crossing at 228.04 are needed to clear up
near-term direction.

ENERGIES The energy markets closed higher on Monday due to short
covering as Iraqi crude oil exports remain halted for the 11th day
and natural gas prices surged due to cold weather moving across the
United States. Momentum indicators are bearish but becoming oversold
hinting a short-term bottom in January crude oil and the products may
be near. Closes above last Thursday's highs in any or all of the
complex would strongly suggest a low has been posted.

CURRENCIES the March Dollar extended its short covering bounce off
last Thursday's low and closed above broken trendline support
crossing near 114. Closes below last week's low at 112.64 are needed
to confirm the recent trendline breakout. However, momentum
indicators have become oversold hinting a short covering bounce is
possible before this fall's decline continues. The March Swiss Franc
and D-mark closed lower on Monday as profit taking from last week's
continues. The overbought condition of a number of momentum
indicators that hints further setbacks is possible before the
corrections are over. The March Japanese Yen posted an inside day
with a higher close due to light short covering as it extends the
current trading range. Momentum indicators have turned bullish
signaling sideways to higher prices near-term are possible. Closes
above .9279 or below .9088 are needed to clear up near-term direction
in the market.

PRECIOUS METALS were closed mixed on Monday. February gold extended
its setback off last Thursday's high due to the rebound in the U.S.
Dollar and in doing so turned a number of momentum indicators neutral
to bearish. Closes below November's uptrend line crossing near 271.80
would confirm the rally off October's low has likely come to an end.
March silver posted an inside day with a higher close due to light
short covering as it consolidated some of last Friday's losses. While
another day or two of consolidation is possible, the door is open for
a test of November's low at 4.69 cents later this month. March copper
closed higher on Monday but near session lows due to profit taking
ahead of the close. Today's spike of the 62% retracement level
crossing at .8947 followed by the low-range close is a warning to
bulls that a short-term top may be in or near. Closes below last
Friday's low crossing at 87.55 would likely turn a number of momentum
indicators bearish and increase the odds that a short- term top has
been posted.

GRAINS closed lower on Monday. March corn posted another inside day
with a lower close as traders squared positions ahead of Tuesday's
supply and demand reports. Additional pressure came from news that
China sold around 1 million tons of corn on Friday. Expectations for
additional sales by China later this week added to the bearish tone.
Traders are looking for the USDA to lower their export projections by
50-100 million bushels in tomorrow's reports. Today's export
inspection report came in at a disappointing 28.394 million bushels
verse 39.660 million bushels last week. March wheat also closed lower
on Monday due to spillover weakness from corn. Traders were reluctant
to buy wheat on chances that some of the hard winter wheat crop may
experience winterkill due to the winter storm rolling across the
plains. Traders are expecting to see the USDA lower its export
projection by some 25-million bushels due to this fall's slow export
pace. March wheat is challenging the lower boundary of this fall's
trading range at 2.69. If this support gives way, 2.63 1/2 then 2.50
are potential targets later this winter.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed mixed on Monday. January beans closed
fractionally higher on Monday due to light position squaring ahead of
tomorrow's supply and demand reports. The trade is looking for a
25-35 million bushels increase in the USDA export projection due to
this fall's strong export sales. Multiple closes above fib resistance
crossing at 5.10 3/4 would open the door for a possible test of this
fall's high at 5.25 later this winter. January soybean meal closed
higher on Monday thereby confirming last Friday's upside reversal.
Expectations for continued strong export demand through this winter
in both the Asian and European markets will continue to underpin the
meal market. Closes above the late- November high crossing at 193.50
would renew November's rally and set the stage for a test of weekly
resistance crossing at 202.50 later this month. January bean oil
posted an inside day with a lower close on Monday as it extends last
week's consolidation pattern. At the same time, momentum indicators
are bearish signaling sideways to lower prices near-term are
possible. A neutral to bearish supply and demand report on Tuesday
may provide the catalyst needed to renew the decline off last week's
high. The stage appears to be set for a test of the late-November low
at 14.64 later this month.

LIVESTOCK closed mixed on Monday. February hogs closed slightly
higher on Monday but near session lows as profit taking ahead of the
close erased early strength tied to weather concerns. Momentum
indicators are bullish but diverging warning traders that a broad
double top may be forming. Closes below last Friday's reaction low
along with a downturn by stochastics would increase the odds a top
has been posted. February cattle posted an inside day with a lower
close as it consolidated some of last week's gains. News that the
heaviest snowfall stayed away from cattle-feeding areas limited gains
in the market, which fell ahead of the close due to light profit
taking. At the same time, cold weather is expected to slow gains,
which will help underpin the market. Momentum indicators are bullish
hinting a test of long-term resistance crossing near 77.92 is still
possible later this month.

FOOD & FIBER markets were mixed on Monday. March coffee posted an
inside day with a lower close on Monday as it consolidated some of
last Friday's losses. However, today's low-range close signals
additional weakness is possible later this week. If the decline
continues, the August 1993 low crossing at 66.25 is March's next
target. March cocoa closed lower on Monday signaling the two-day
bounce off last Wednesday's low has come to an end. Today's loss
turned a number of momentum indicators neutral to bearish signaling a
test of November's low at 713 is possible. Closes below this support
level would open the door for a test of psychological support
crossing at 700 later this winter. March sugar posted a downside
reversal on Monday due to a lack of cash buying. March continues to
consolidate above minor support crossing at 950. However, momentum
indicators remain bearish signaling sideways to lower prices into the
end of the year are possible. March cotton posted an inside day with
a higher close due to light position squaring ahead of Tuesday's
supply and demand report. The big question is whether or not the USDA
will lower world production enough to off set lower US demand. Closes
above 69.25 or below 66.90 cents are needed to clear up near-term
direction in the market.

interested, please respond to the following questions by Monday afternoon, 
April 30.  If you would prefer to reply verbally, stop by Debra's desk and 
she will write them down.  Debra also has information about the games if you

Shippers Protest KMI's Order 637 Tariff Changes

Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission (KMI) has attempted an end run 
around FERC's Order 637,
filing wide-ranging operational and rate changes early under expedited tariff 
procedures to avoid the
more rigorous review in store for compliance filings, according to customer 
protests. 

Items in KMI's tariff filing fall into no less than 13 general categories, 
Indicated Shippers said. They include
imbalance provisions, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality, 
point allocations, curtailment 
priorities, right of first refusal, scheduling priorities, incidental 
purchase and sale, capacity release,
unauthorized gas, capacity rights overrun charge, and miscellaneous. 

Indicated Shippers called for summary rejection or maximum suspension of 
KMI's June 5 tariff filing (RP00-316), 
saying ""most of the changes proposed in this case represent an effort by KMI 
to implement elements of 
Order 637 selectively and in a manner designed to minimize the opportunity 
for meaningful review and 
comment by KMI's customers."" Only 12 days are allowed for intervention and 
comment on usually routine 
tariff filings, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has allotted 
30 days for comments on 
Order 637 compliance filings. KMI was among the group of pipelines slated to 
make compliance filings June 15. 

KMI said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing, but was aimed 
at changing its tariff to reflect ""the 
current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices.."" It 
did acknowledge, ""A number of the 
changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the Commission's 
goals in Order No. 637."" 

Indicated Shippers also protested changes that would make decisions regarding 
negative storage imbalances 
and end of season inventory swaps a matter of KMI's discretion without any 
standards on how those decisions 
would be made. The shippers also protested changes to the default methodology 
for point allocations for billing 
purposes, and the injection of KMI discretion into the formula for accepting 
or rejecting predetermined allocation 
agreements with upstream or downstream parties. In addition curtailment 
provisions filed by KMI appear to be 
contrary to Order 637-A's mandate that shippers moving gas within the primary 
path should have primary rights. 

The filing also would give the pipeline the opportunity to bottle up 
significant quantities of coal bed methane gas 
in Wyoming's Powder River Basin by imposing more rigorous standards on 
nitrogen content, according to 
Western Gas Resources. A key change would impose a nitrogen gas quality 
specification of 3% by volume. 
While KMI states the change is necessary to accommodate transfers with 
interconnecting pipelines, six of the 
seven connecting pipelines identified have no nitrogen specifications. Only 
KMI's affiliate, Natural Gas
Pipeline Co. of America, has similar rules, Western Gas said. 

""KMI's proposed nitrogen specification would enable KMI to refuse to accept 
coal bed methane production for 
transportation, thereby foreclosing the availability of one of the principal 
means of downstream pipeline egress 
out of Powder River production areas,"" Western Gas added. Producers would 
have to shut in production while 
they construct costly nitrogen facilities. This could ""create at least a 
temporary gap in the downstream 
movement of coal bed supplies to mid-continent and eastern markets, thus 
frustrating consumer access to 
these significant supplies.""

admin processes for ""regular"" TW deals and the upcoming EnronOnline deals.

For the regular deals:

Primary Contract Admin person is Michelle Cormier, backup by Dennis Lee.
Michelle Lokay will essentially take over the admin duties previously handled 
by Christine Stokes including generating discount letters and inputting rates 
in the system.  Backup will be handled by TK Lohman, Kevin Hyatt, and Craig 
Buehler.
The contract log and previous ""firm book report"" will be replaced by the 
automated ""Transactional Report"" from the contract system.
We will also look at establishing a ""general"" mailbox to which customers can 
send contract change requests.  This way multiple team members can access the 
box and handle the requests.


For On-line Deals

Michelle Lokay is the primary contact working with Michelle Cormier.  
Counter-parties will not receive a paper contract but will be get a 
confirming email.
Credit will be have already been approved as part of the online process.
Michelle Lokay will print the screen once a deal has been lifted and route 
that to Contract Admin for input to the system.
M. Cormier will generate the contract number so it can be emailed to the 
customer.

Calif. approves Calpine plant
The California Energy Commission on Monday
gave the final go-ahead for Calpine to begin con-struction
on its 600-MW, natural gas-fired Metcalf
Energy Center in San Jose, the company said.
The approval follows a two-and-a-half year
battle against local interests opposed to the proj-ect,
which will be located in power-hungry Silicon
Valley. Calpine is partnering with Bechtel Enter-prises
to build the plant.
The initial tide of local opposition was finally
turned by widespread support for the proposed
facility from state energy agencies, Gov. Gray Davis
and environmental groups. San Jose's city council
had initially refused to give zoning approval for the
facility but changed tack after the groundswell of
statewide support and the seriousness of the
state's energy shortage became apparent.
""We have always believed this is an ideal
location for a plant, in a region without its own
local source of significant power generation,"" Ken
Abreu, general manager for joint development for
the companies, said in a statement.
Calpine and Bechtel will begin construction
next month, with the start of commercial opera-tions
set for the second half of 2003. ","Calpine Gray Davis Ken

2090,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us.

2092,"Effective 2/1/02 a new company will go into effect called ENNG.  The company code is 179E.

The primary purpose of this company is to account for the payroll of the Enron employees who are currently on company 0179, and who will remain Enron employees after the 2/1/02 transition of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy.  

With respect to coding invoices, recording time and other similar transactions on Northern Natural Gas (0179) please note the following that are effective 2/1/02:
 
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 FAR order or project, continue using the same codes.  No changes here.
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 cost center, use the same cost center number except replace the first digit with a 5.  For example, if you would have charged 111222, charge 511222 instead.  These ""5"" series cost centers have been set up on company 179E, but their payroll and expenses flow into company 0179.  You will not be able to code direct to a 0179 cost center after January business (1/31/02).  
If you are becoming a Dynegy employee on 2/1/02, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 do not enter your time into eHRonline or the SAP timekeeping application.  During the next week or two we will be working with Dynegy on an alternative for capturing and accounting for your time and payroll expenses.
If you are currently a 0179 employee and are continuing as an Enron employee, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 continue entering your time as you ordinarily would.  Unless you exception code to FAR orders or projects, your hours will automatically go into the appropriate ""5"" series cost center on company 179E.  

If you have any questions or need additional information concerning these coding changes please contact Trey Meerbott at (713) 853-7003.",Dynegy Trey Meerbott,,Enron SAP

I've done some checking, and the answer is no, a negotiated rate shipper that 
entered into a contract after March 27, 2000 does not automatically get ROFR 
rights.   This was clearly stated by FERC in Order No. 637-A.   It does not 
matter whether the negotiated rate is above the maximum tariff rate; the 
contract is still not considered to be ""at maximum rates"" for ROFR purposes.

As you know, our tariff does allow us to mutually agree to include ROFR 
rights in a contract with a shipper who does not automatically get ROFR 
rights.

I would like to introduce into the contract the latest set of guidelines that 
we have agreed to with GE.  Those guidelines are currently for a power island 
type test at ARCOS, but they can easily be converted into a gas turbine only 
test.  Furthermore, the latest guidelines are much more precise, technically 
correct and reflect all of the agreements that GE and us have reached over 
the last year or so.  I understand that we do not want to go into a whole new 
set of reviews, etc, but I believe I can modify the ARCOS guidelines to 
address the testing of gas turbines (gas and oil) relatively quickly, get 
together with GE's performance engineer, go over the guidelines and have 
everybody agreeing rather rapidly.  We have a better document that what is 
currently in the contract for Blue Dog, why not use the better document?

Regards,

Tony

The tour we are conducting next week is designed to provide Livingston County 
officials with a first hand view of the Lincoln Energy Center in Manhattan, 
IL.

The scope of work which Piper Marbury (Mark Gershon, Karen Way) is working 
under is described below:
 1.  Interface with Livingston officials to determine appropriate invite list 
from Zoning Board of Appeals, Plan Commision, and County Board
 2.  Attend the tour on 8/22 (approx 4 hours) - Presentation to attendees, 
site tour, bus ride to and from Livingston
 3.  Handle follow-up issues/questions from Livingston officials

We conducted a similar tour for the Kendall County officals in June and it 
was very beneficial in terms of obtaining our local zoning and other 
approvals.  We are obviously hoping for a similar result with the Livingston 
County group.

2156,"Hi Kara,

I haven't written because I haven't figured out what we learned at the 
meeting.  We can discuss next week at our conference.  We are arranging to 
have Michael re-tested.  I think it is more of an issue of a difference 
between potential and performance.  Michael has been tested in the past, and 
tests as extraordinarily bright, but he has had some performance issues which 
don't match up.  At least that's how I understand it. He just has some 
disconnects which we are working to overcome, but I must admit to not 
understanding it all.

I left you a note about Michael possibly missing next week.  After I dropped 
him off this am, I had a thought that next week might be when they visit in 
1st grade, in which case we probably wouldn't want him to miss that 
opportunity.  I think he is excited about 1st grade, so you must be doing a 
great job of getting the kids prepared.

Thanks for everything, and see you next week!

2157,"Have just talked with adjuster again, and she has preliminary verbal report 
from surveyor who says that drawings merely confirm his prior contention that 
this generator was NOT a total loss at the time of the loss, but that further 
inspection of the unit would be necessary to prove otherwise.  

The comments from Andrew Edison about pressing SWPC on their responsibilities 
and ownership of the unit, this has previously been expressed by the adjuster 
to Jim Bouillion.  She definitely would like to have a sit down meeting with 
Enron people only, not SWPC at this time,  to discuss options and where we go 
from here.  She still hasn't signed the CA, but that is not necessary as she 
is not looking at the drawings and looking at them by her is not necessary 
for the purpose of a meeting with Enron.  

I did not check her availability for a meeting at this time because my 
schedule for Mon-Tues is still up in the air, and Jim Bouillion has a Mon-Wed 
meeting with our captive insurer in Vermont and would not be available before 
Thursday.  Do we collectively want to go forward with the sit down meeting 
with the adjuster, and if yes, who all needs to be involved and what are 
their availabilities?

Concerning the VALUE of the generator, the declared value of the entire 
shipment was $24,506,000.  There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or 
the broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess 
someone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is 
not a ""replacement cost value""  policy nor an ""actual cash value"" policy, but 
a ""valued"" policy.  What that means is we get paid what ever we declared the 
value to be CIF + 10%.  Hence the need to know what part of the $24,506,000 
is the ""value"" of the generator.

2174,"I responding to your comments as follows:

Sect. 1.9.  The second to last sentence in the definition of Cumulative Net 
Revenues duplicates part (but not all) of the first sentence of Section 7.2 
with regard to what is included in Cumulative Net Revenue. . . . Perhaps the 
make-up of Cumulative Net Revenue should be covered in just one place or, as 
an alternative, the definition 1.9 could cross-reference 7.2.

You're absolutely right.  The ""and, for purposes of Section 7.1, Section 7.2"" 
reference is a bust.  I've recast the sentence as ""The calculation of 
Cumulative Net Revenues is made expressly subject to Sections 2.10 and 7.2.""

I don't believe the language of Sect. 7.2 regarding the make-up of Cumulative 
Net Revenue is intended to be only ""for purposes of Section 7.1"" as the 
wording of 7.2 suggests.

I included that to avoid any unintended consequences in the event we later 
use ""Cumulative Net Revenue"" in other contexts for which it wouldn't be 
appropriate to include such refund-revenues; but if you believe it's 
confusing, I'll delete the clause.

Sect. 3.3. I would delete part (i) if the last sentence. It would be illegal 
and contrary to this Agreement for MEH (or Peoples) to charge a rate above 
the maximum, so it seems inappropriate to suggest that MEH can collect a fee 
for doing this.

Per our discussion, I agree that it seems inappropriate to contemplate 
knowing violations of federal law.  I'll soften it so it will have a better 
chance of not raising regulatory hackles.

Perhaps we should just make Peoples responsible for all refunds. Let me know 
what you think.

That would be easier, but it seems fair that we should be responsible for 
risks we knowingly or recklessly assume.

Also, 6 lines from the end of 7.2, I think the reference to 7.2 (ii) is a 
typo. I believe it's just 7.2.

It's now changed.

Sect. 18.3. Do we want to include any work related to the Governmental 
Approval as ""ordinary course""?

My inclination is to not include it, so as to avoid arguments with Peoples 
over what's extraordinary and what's ordinary in this context.

As always, I thank you for your help.  DT

Here's a revised version of the option agreement.  I changed the shipping 
dates, quantity (10), Outside Exercise Date, and the amount of the option 
payment.  I did not change the prices, since I had not discussed this with 
Ben, and couldn't get the numbers to work.  

Have there been some changes to the data sheets?  It appears to me that there 
might be a version which reflects the inclusion of the low sound option.  In

2179,"I think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality 
hurdles in all kinds of agreements, including confidentiality agreements.  In 
short, our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to 
potential purchasers of projects, contracts and assets, and not all of our 
forms allow this.

I'm trying to include an exception for ""potential lenders and investors"" 
whenever I can (instead of just lenders). Does someone have a more artful or 
effective solution?  

Just wanted to share the thought so that more eyes could be watching for the 
issue.

public by nature.  For example, we were asked for material from the Form 10Q

that the data regarding turbine configuration and the noise footprint, for
example, were not treated confidentiality.

The things that were submitted under seal primarily dealt with cost

the only entity which has requested the information, and will not

2182,"	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In the latest update of Enron Corp.'s (ENE, news, msgs) 
bandwidth trading activities, the company's chairman said Tuesday that it has 
completed about 90 trades of telecommunications bandwidth. 
	Speaking at the Dain Rauscher Energy 2000 Conference, Enron Chairman Ken Lay 
talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for 
bandwidth trading and broadband services. 
	Asked what kind of company Enron is, Lay gave an answer that shows the recent 
expansion of the company's business strategy beyond energy. Enron is still 
basically ""an energy and broadband company,"" he said. 
	While energy is still the source of most of Enron's revenue, Lay's answer 
underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth 
trading. A number of Enron officials have been quoted in the last year as 
saying that, in a few years, it could be making as much money from those 
areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses. 
	Enron plans to spend $600 million-$650 million this year and about the same 
amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading, 
Lay said. It will spend more during that time if necessary. 
	In fact, the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in 
emerging markets that aren't growing quickly enough to meet Enron's 
standards. Proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and 
bandwidth trading, which are growing more quickly, he said. 
	In pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity, Enron's 90 bandwidth deals 
put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area. El Paso Energy 
Corp. (EPG, news, msgs) officials have said they have done 5-10 bandwidth 
trades this year. Companies like Williams Communications Group (WCG, news, 
msgs) won't talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made. 
	Bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a 
telecommunications network. 
	Enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the 
end of this year, Lay said. Some of the fiber-optic network will be lit, or 
made operational, this year with the rest to be lit later. 
	The company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in New York, 
Los Angeles, Las Vegas and London. Enron's current plans call for a total of 
13 pooling points. 
	Bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can 
connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another, 
facilitating bandwidth trading. 
	Enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in 
December as part of its deal with Blockbuster Video and a number of telecom 
carriers. 
	The deal is a 20-year exclusive, worldwide deal with a potential contract 
value of more than $1 billion to Enron, according to materials the company 
handed out at the conference.

Here are some come comments to the draft PPA:

As a general note, we would have these goals:

1.  Keep the PPA has streamlined as possible, putting as much as we can in 
the interconnection agreement.
2.  Minimize ties to specific unit.
3.  Maximize optionality, especially delivery points.
4.  Keep construction/ownership of the facility off the balance sheet.
5.  Signing the interconnection agreement must be simultaneous, or a CP.

More specifically we would like to:

Move start up/metering terms to interconnection agreement.
Megawatts will probably change due to change in equipment.  Bracket 192 for 
now.  The capacity will change for summer and winter, also, specifics to be 
determined.
Make sure we are protected from any liability caused by their delay.

Comments on specific articles:
Definition of emergency start up will belong in interconnection agreement.
2.2  Expiration is Dec. 31, 2004; move  bracketed language into interconnect.
2.3  We need an out in case we don't commence construction/achieve commercial 
operation as a result of Buyer's action/inaction, and the term ""breach"" 
should include failure to timely perform any of buyer's obligations under any 
of the agreements. Any reason why we shouldn't want an extension if there is 
a delay due to action/inaction of any governmental authority?  We can add 
change of law as an event which gives us schedule relief, but we might want 
to broaden the definition of change of law. Also, we don't have the site 
acquired yet, so we may need an out in case we encounter a problem, unless we 
will not sign this agreement before acquiring the site.
3.4  Peak period is July and August.
3.5 (b) Amount left over will depend on the summer and winter capacity.  
Might just leave blanks as placeholders.
3.5 (c) Let's try for 4 hours notice.
3.5 (d) suggest title ""Start-Up Minimum Run Time"".
3.5 (e)  add maximum of ___ per year.  
Need a minimum shut down time between start ups.
4.6 Note:  3.3 refers to alternate sources and market sources; 4.6 refers to 
the wholesale market.  We should pick a term, define it, and use it 
throughout. 
8.1 (c)  replace ""covenant"" with ""obligation"", and follow with ""(other than 
payment)"". Default isn't a remedy, so there's a disconnect in that sentence.  
8.1 (d) remove ""shall"" and conform grammar in romanettes.
8.3 refers to LD's, 4.8 but I didn't see any unless 4.8 is meant to encompass 
the concept. A little unclear to me.  How is this supposed to work with 4.8? 
Is there any reason the damage waiver can't be absolute?  Does the sole and 
exclusive language in 4.8 need to be conspicuous, or is it ok?
9.1  Is the demand charge included in the invoice, or is it due without an 
invoice?
10.1 On the third line, shouldn't the second ""Seller"" be ""Buyer""?
15.  No mediation.
16.1  Delete oral amendment language.

Exhibits:
A. Megawatts, heat  rate to be confirmed.  Heat rate believed to be 10,600. 
Deleted bracketed language about implied cost of fuel from alternate source 
energy.  Start up costs:  $500.  Emergency start up to be addressed later.

Could we schedule a conference call for Friday or Monday to discuss any 
questions/issues.  Please let me know your availability.

A draft of testimony which would be filed at the ICC with the Master Sales
Agreement Petition is attached to the accompanying memo from Jerry Fox. As
you may recall, we suggested that the draft Petition prepared by Peoples
several weeks ago be revised to better explain the transactions which would
occur under the Master Agreement and provide a basis for the ICC to
conclude that approval of the agreement is in the public interest. At the
time, Jerry said he generally agreed with the comments, but had to get more
information from his client to finalize the Petition. His intent was to
obtain the information in the form of draft testimony, which he has now
done. My preliminary review indicates that the testimony, which would
accompanying the Petition, is adequate. It explains the nature of the
expected transactions, explains how Peoples' customers benefit from the
transactions (i.e., why approval is in the public interest) and supports
the compensation mechanism. Although the testimony is somewhat sketchy, it
should be sufficient to initiate the review. The ICC Staff can ask for
whatever additional information it wishes to consider. When I speak to
Jerry, I plan to ask whether the initial draft Petition would be modified
to discuss some of the information he now has. (I believe this could be
easily done.) In any event, the basic information needed to support the
filing seems to be there. Let me know of any comments. I will wait until I
hear back before talking to Jerry Fox. (Am I correct that the new name,

On the SDEC: 
this is no longer an '02 play.  To keep it as an '03 play three things need 
to happen:
(1) we need to move our application for an Unusual Use Permit from the 
jurisdiction of the Community Zoning Appeals Board (""CZAB"") to the Board of 
County Commissioners.  The CZAB is a parochial board that is stacked with 
NIMBY's.  We have been doing our assessment of the communities and after 
weeks of investigation we have concluded that if we go before the CZAB, we 
feel we will be facing sudden death.  However, if we go before the County 
Commissioners, we will have a very good chance of success.  The vehicle we 
propose to use to change the jurisdiction is something called an Application 
of Vested Rights. As I understand it, (I'm getting info on this today), this 
is a statement that says that a property owner is being prevented from any 
use of his property.  This application needs to be submitted to the county 
before June 6th, the date of our CZAB hearing. 
(2) we will need to negotiate an arrangement with Dade County Department of 
Environmental Resources Management (""DERM"") who is responsible for ensuring 
that the land fill be closed.  They have been pushing the owner of the 
property to initiate the closure work.  The land owner, Certrosa Holdings,  
is a single asset company and the sole owner lives in Venezuela.   If we were 
not in the picture, I believe Certrosa Holdings would most likely default on 
the obligation to close the landfill leaving the county to clean it up (at $3 
to 4 million). To keep this as an '03 play we will need to get DERM to agree 
to post pone the closure proceedings for at least a year and we will need 
provide some assurances that if we do exercise the option and get in the 
chain of title that we would assume the obligation to close the landfill. We 
may need to initiate this conversation in the next 2 to 3 weeks.
(3) we will need to extend the Option Agreement which expires on September.  
The strike price for this property is approximately $1.3 million and we paid 
$200,000 for a 9 month option last October (when the rules were soft costs 
could not exceed 5% of the total project cost of $175 million).  Based on the 
success of (1) and (2) above, we may need to initiate this discussion in the 
next 2 to 3 weeks as well.

On the Medley - Dunn discussions:
As you know, when Ann Elizabeth and I left the the Dunns, last month, they 
had two deal breakers: (a) they wanted a committment on our part that we 
would pay a certain amount of taxes to the town and not go for a tax 
abatement.  (we said the taxes and any arrangement we make with the town 
would not involve the Dunns) (b) they wanted us to assume all past and 
present environmental liabilities.  We said no to both conditions and halted 
discussions.  I have heard from the real estate agent representing the Dunns 
that they are considering giving on both these items.  If we structured an 
arrangement where we did a phase 2 environmental assessment during a 60 to 90 
day ""due diligence"" period (rather than in an option period or under a 90 day 
lease), gave both parties the chance to opt out of the deal based on the 
results of the phase 2; and, we change the agreement back to the way it was 
in the last Andrew &  Kurth draft which was silent on the issue of historical 
environmental liability and liability from environmental problems that arise 
in the future but are not the result of our operations.  Would this 
arrangement give us adequate protection and give us the right to sue if 
necessary to have the Dunns or any other responsible party help pay for any 
clean up?  If this is something we can work with, we need to have a 
conversation with the Dunn's attorney.  What do you think?

2214,"One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do? 
 ",SDEC Ann Elizabeth,,Certosa Holdings Shutts & Bowen
2215,"Ben,

I know you want to put Certosa Holdings on the back burner for a while but unfortunately we can't stop the process unless we withdrawal our request for unusual use permit.   If we do so, we can not re-submit for 18 months.   Since the application was submitted in the name of Certosa Holdings, if the property is conveyed to another entity, it may be possible to re-submit under this new entity.  I've asked Kay to look into the possibility if throwing Certosa Holdings into bankruptcy.  I have not heard back but here are my thoughts:
	(1) We are not a creditor and therefore we may not have the ability to put CH in bankruptcy
	(2) If we can deem CH in default of the option agreement,  one of the remedies is reimbursement.  Since CH is illiquid, we would automatically be a creditor with the 	     ability to throw them into bankruptcy
	(3) Once in bankruptcy, I don't know what would happen.  There are no secured creditors and we would be the only unsecured creditor.  
	(4) Whether bankruptcy would halt the unusual use permit approval process or not, I do not know. 
Until we determine if bankruptcy helps, us we have no choice but to proceed.

I estimate the burn rate will be between $50,000 and $60,000 per month through October.  This is broken down into four types of costs:
	(a) lobbyists: $17,000 per month from June through October plus $210,000 in success fees if we get project approval from the commissioners.
	(b) yet to be negotiated option consideration:  $20k to $35k to Certosa Holdings as well as an adjacent property owner looking for a buyout
	(c) land fill closure related activities: $35,000 (ground water testing, fencing the property and funding assistance to get $800,000 of bond money released to reimburse 	     closure costs)
	(d) Consultants and lawyers: $23,000 per month

  
As you know we are now out of the jurisdiction of the CZAB and in the jurisdiction of the Board of County Commissioners.  Below is a summary of where we are and where we need to go.  Please let me know when you have a few minutes to discuss this project.

Renew or New Option Agreement:
We need to renegotiate the Option Agreement with Certosa Holdings:  Rather than giving CH a chunk of money that could disappear immediately, I'd like to structure an arrangement where we fund, as long as the Option Agreement is in effect (we don't terminate before expiration), some landfill closure work.  This benefits both Enron and CH as DERM will be more amenable to amending the Consent Agreement that sets out the time table of closure if they can see some progress.  I an trying to get with Kay to discuss alternatives.  We need to be aware that CH could file bankruptcy sooner or later.  I checked the Option Agreement and unlike some of the other agreements, this one does not appear to have bankruptcy as a default.  If we have to give CH anything I would want to give him only a nominal amount of money;  $25k max

Option on adjacent property:
As referenced above, we (Kerri) have been contacted  by an attorney representing a property owner adjacent to the CH site who may be looking for a buy out.  The property is wetlands and should be relatively cheap considering it is useless.

Unusual Use Permit Application and Claim of Taking:
We expect to present the project and argue the taking issue before the Development of Impact Committee (""DIC"") in July.  This is a committee of County Department heads.  They will make a recommendation to the Board of County Commissioners who will hear the merits of the project and decide on whether to approve the project.  Only if they reject the project does the taking issue come into play.  I will work to target the Board of County Commissioners hearing for October.

DERM (Department of Environmental Resource Management) issues:
When we executed this option agreement, we fully expected CH to have closed the landfill by now.  Obviously things have changed.  

We (Kerri, Valorie Settles of Shutts & Bowen and I) met DERM last week.  DERM is willing to consider revising the Consent Agreement and the schedule of closing the landfill.  We discussed creating a 3 phase closure.  the first phase would be the easy (cheap) stuff as discussed above.  The second phase would be more expensive and may include removal of a pile of wood for $171k and or removal of exotics from the wetlands for $83k.  The second phase would be times to occur after we received County Commissioners approval for the Unusual Use Permit.  The third phase would be the very expensive stuff ($ millions) and would be timed to be when we expect to exercise the option.

FIVE GREAT LESSONS:

1 -   Most Important Lesson - During my second month of nursing school, our 
professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed 
through the questions,until I read the last one: ""What is the first name of 
the woman who cleans the school?"" Surely this was some kind of joke. I had 
seen the cleaning woman several times.  She was tall, dark-haired and in her 
50s, but how would I know her name?  I handed in my paper, leaving the last 
question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last 
question would count toward our quiz grade. ""Absolutely,"" said the professor. 
""In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They 
deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say 
'hello'."" ""I've never forgotten that lesson.  I also learned her name was 
Dorothy.

2 - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain. One night, at 11:30 PM, an 
older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway 
trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down and she 
desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next 
car.  A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those 
conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance 
and put her into a taxi cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down 
his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's 
door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A 
special note was attached. It read: ""Thank you so much for assisting me on 
the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my
clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able 
to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away.  God 
bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others."" Sincerely, Mrs. Nat 
King  Cole.

3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve. In the days 
when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel 
coffee shop and sat at a table.  A waitress put a glass of water in front of 
him.
""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked. ""Fifty cents,"" replied the 
waitress. The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the 
coins in it. ""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he inquired. By 
now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing 
impatient. ""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely replied."" The little boy again 
counted his coins.  ""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he said.  The waitress 
brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy 
finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came 
back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly 
beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies - You see, he 
couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a 
tip.

4 -  Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path. In ancient times, a 
King had a boulder placed on a roadway. then he hid himself and watched to 
see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest 
merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.  Many loudly 
blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about 
getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load 
of vegetables. Upon
approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move 
the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he 
finally succeeded.  After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he 
noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse 
contained many gold coins and a note from the king  indicating that the gold 
was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant 
learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an 
opportunity to improve our condition. 

5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts. Many years ago, when I 
worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz 
who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her only chance of 
recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who 
had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies 
needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her 
little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his 
blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a 
deep breath and saying, ""Yes, I'll do it if it will save her."" As the 
transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we 
all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew pale 
and his smile  faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling 
voice, ""Will I start to die right away?"" Being young, the little boy had 
misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister 
all of his blood in order to save her. You see, after all, understanding and 
attitude, are everything.","Liz

how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.

LOL ISSUES:
1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can
effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct
in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited
or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not
accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or
otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any
""to the fullest extent permitted by law"" clause or other  such stuff as a
compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.

2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity
for Haz Mat, patents, etc.

3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all
third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or
whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past. I
would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the larger
Enron is working it.  Please try it again if you can.

silent on third party personal injury and property damage, and silent on 
hazardous materials.  Their standard language also stipulates limit of 
liability being capped at the purchase price for any and all claims.

In going through the contracts assigned to us, I have determined that we do not have all contracts necessary to evaluate our exposure/potential work out of the various transaction.  To summarize:

1.Oglethorpe Power Corp.:  The Interchange Agreement supplied is expired.  Is there an amendment or extension?

2.Ameren Services Company:  The contract is sell only (Ameren sells to EPMI), but we have positions in our books whereby Ameren has the obligation to purchase from EPMI.  There must be a MPPSA or another contract that allows for purchases as well.  Ameren has the obligation to purchase 300-400 MW on-peak for next summer.  This one should be a relatively easy sell/assignment to a third party.

3.Connecticut Light & Power:  Termination is subject to conditions outlined in the Mid-Connecticut Project Termination, Assignment and Assumption Agreement (I think this is the bigger CRRA agreement).  Jim Grace and Sheila Tweed are the responsible parties for the CRRA workout.  As this contract is inextricably linked, shouldn't they take over this contract as well?

4.GPU:  I believe there are additional contracts out there  governing transactions between EPMI and the various GPU subsidiaries.  Will you have a search run on the follow company names?

GPU Services
GPU Energy
Jersey Central Power & Light Company
Metropolitan Edison Company
Pennsylvania Electric Company

In the months of September and to date in October, unbilled fees are

How do you recommend we handle DEP's latest notice of change for Pompano and when do you recommend we issue our response to the change?  

The anticipated settlement conditions are as follows:

	1.	only one facility will have back-up fuel (Enron to choose as some point in time between DBEC or PBEC) while the other facility is gas only.  The oil use and emissions levels are per the air permit (which may or may not be the same depending on the outcome of the Pompano notice of change).
	2.	Enron to provide a one time payment for emissions monitoring to be procured, operated and maintained by DPEP.

I've recently become involved in the ""cell sale"" side, meaning the 
transaction to sell the Fuel Cell equipment cells to CRRA.  I've met the Fuel 
Cell folks, but have not met anyone with CRRA yet.

Currently, I'm preparing a letter of intent for Enron/CRRA for the 
purchase/sale of the cells, have a development agreement prepared by outside 
counsel to review, and need to come up with a draft purchase agreement for 
FCE to review. I'll make sure Dan is in the loop on as much of that as he 
cares to read.

I've heard a rumor of an issue regarding the authority of CRRA to purchase 
the equipment (perhaps relating to the use of bond money for the purchase), 
but haven't come up to speed on that issue yet.  I would like to chase down 
that issue some more before a loud alarm is sounded, however.  

I'll get a grasp on the hearing protocol, as I know Dave is very interested 
in that aspect of the process.

We'd like to keep CPL/NCNG out of the middle for as long as possible.  I'm 
sure they already know what we are up to, but I'd rather not lay it out for 
them.  So I'd prefer if Gisele Rankin did not discuss our plans to purchase 
gas from Rocky Mount.   If she happens to run into the CPL lawyer and he asks 
her again about this, tell her to say Enron is still working on fuel supply 
alternatives.

We should start the process of annexing the land hopefully very soon.  Once 
Rocky Mount has the property annexed, they have a much stronger argument for 
serving the load and NCNG won't be able to hold us hostage to their 
uncompetitive rates.

Thanks for the heads up.

might be a version which reflects the inclusion of the low sound option.  In

Brian, I asked Shauywn to send this to me as it shows that the rate HPL gave us for transport and the price they are apparently giving to ETOCO is  close to .19 apart (although the current contract they have w/ ETOCO is in evergreen so the producer may be in for a rude awakening from HPL soon)....let me know if you want to discuss more. Thanks.

2445,"Pagers, Cell Phones, etc should be cancelled as of closing which I believe to be June 1st, I will let you know if there are any changes.  When I arrange for new traders I will need computers for them.  I have talked to Ed and Brian and they have agreed to give me 4 computers back prior to closing.  I anticipate needing 2 of them prior to the end of the month.  How much lead time do you need to have them brought down here?  Did you get the message out about customer entertainment?

Hi,

	 	The power options trading desk is beginning to structure deals and to make markets in spark spread options ( options on the spreads between power prices and natural gas prices).  Please refer to the attached file for further information.   
	

 	   	It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.

   	
	 	 Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,

As Mike probably also mentioned we have the attention at the top of NIC.  
Both Frevert and McConnell got a good taste of their commitment during a 5+ 
hour meeting two weeks ago.  I will be in Houston this coming week to speak 
with the different product heads about Project Sato (NIC) and help establish 
some priorities with them.  We should try to establish some time to speak.

Coordination on this becomes critical to show results as quickly as 
possible.  I plan on speaking with Eric and Jonathan next week as well.

Thanks for the update.  I like the progress.

I realize that we can not cover us 100% for the future contract but at least 
it will help.  What I think we need is some way to protect us incase he gives 
us a very high bid price to build the house  because we are captive.  What do 
you suggest as a possible remedy?  Some sort of checks on allowing others to 
bid?   Some sort of out on re-purchasing the lot at a set price?  Without a 
cost plus methodology we could be very vulnerable here.  What do you think?

A few of the other issues you addressed in the earlier fax.

2. Earnest money:  I like putting it in title company vs. Flair.  
3. Title policy:  Lets go ahead and take the additional coverage, I think it 
is prudent especially with the new subdivision. How much does an additional 
15% cost?  I don't have any idea.
4.  have provided
5.  not sure i understand this
6.  yes, delete 
7. definitely change and check b1 and hire an inspector
8. add in clarifying statement
9. agree to add builder obligation.  I am fine with a quick closing date and 
needs specificity.  Does he have an estimated time of completion?
10. Rollback taxes:  I agree, clarify as to the exemption, we need to be 
protected here.
11. add this to contract.  Flare may want the money but we should try it.

I hope this helps.  After you review and discuss these issues, let's get 
together via phone and discuss outstanding issues.  Please call Cathy 
Phillips with a time to talk.  She can be reached at 713 853-6898

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.",,,Enron Corp. Savings Plan Savings Plan Hewitt and Northern Trust Enron

<br><br><br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>The good oil</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Oil-industry consolidation continues, as <b>Phillips Petroleum</b> and <b>Conoco</b> announced a $15 billion all-share merger. The new company, to be called ConocoPhillips, is likely to be the sixth-biggest producer in the world, based on revenues.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Normandy Mining</b>, of Australia, wooed by rival bids from America's <b>Newmont Mining</b> and South Africa's<b> AngloGold</b>, rejected AngloGold's all-share bid. This paves the way for a possible sweetened counter-offer from AngloGold, the world's second-largest gold producer. </font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Enron's</b> financial turmoil worsened. But the Texan energy giant managed to put off repayment of some debts until mid-December. Enron's shares plunged to ten-year lows, casting greater doubt over its plans to be taken over in a rescue bid by smaller rival <b>Dynegy</b>.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Three <b>European steel makers</b>, Aceralia, Arbed and Usinor, patched up differences that had threatened their plans to merge, by agreeing to reduce Usinor's stake in the combined entity. The new company will be the world's biggest steel maker.</font></p>
<br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>Optimism at last</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">The <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average </b>has climbed by nearly 20% above its lows on September 21st, leading some optimists to announce the emergence of a new bull market. The index came within 23 points of the 10,000 mark before falling back.</font></p>

</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Brand names got a boost in Europe. The European Court of Justice handed a victory to jeans maker <b>Levi Strauss</b> when it ruled that sales of so-called &#8220;parallel imports&#8221; from outside the European Union's jurisdiction were allowed only with the consent of the trademark owner. The decision ends Levi's three-year battle with Tesco, a British supermarket chain, that sold cut-price Levi's jeans imported from the United States.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">American <b>industrial production</b> fell for the 13th straight month, the longest continuous decline since the second world war. Other indicators were more optimistic: the Conference Board's index of leading indicators rose by 0.3% in October, raising hopes that the widely expected recession might not last long.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Schmidtbank</b>, a 170-year-old family-owned German bank, was rescued from some decidedly modern investments by a consortium of bigger peers, including Deutsche Bank, <font size=""-1"">HVB</font> Group, Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank.

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Shares in <b>Bull</b>, the troubled French computer company, shot up when its chairman, Guy de Panafieu, resigned. The French government pledged <i>euro</i>100m ($88m) to the company, though the European Commission, which is strongly opposed to state subsidies, may yet raise objections to the plan.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">The chief of <b>Barclays'</b> French operations was questioned by magistrates in Paris as part of an investigation into alleged money laundering between France and Israel.

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">The European Commission levied a <i>euro</i>855m ($750) fine, the largest in its history, against <b>Roche </b>and <b>BASF</b>, and six other companies, for price-fixing in the market for vitamins. Two years ago, both companies were fined by antitrust regulators in America, and a Roche executive was jailed for four months.</font></p>

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

2459,"                      RECRUITING: JUCO LB says OU will be tough to beat
                      By James Hale
                      Date: Nov 26, 2001

                      The latest on San Francisco junior college linebacker
Lance Mitchell's visit to
                      Norman


                     LANCE MITCHELL, MLB, 6'3, 243, 4.5, SAN FRANCISCO C.C,
CALIFORNIA:

                     JH: How did your visit to OU this weekend go?

                     LM: Oklahoma was real good and I had a great time.
Oklahoma has a need for
                     linebackers and that is important to me. The people
were great and the town was
                     super. Being from LA, many people told me that I
wouldn't like a small town like
                     Norman, but that wasn't true. Norman seems to be a
great town and a great town
                     that I could live in. My host was Roy Williams and he
is a great guy. He showed us
                     a little Cali love!

                     JH: What did you think of the OU defense?

                     LM: I loved the defensive scheme. I loved the people
that were on the field that
                     would be back if I went to Oklahoma. I liked the
coaches and how they went about
                     their business. I think I would fit in real well with
them.

                     JH: What did you think of the way OU plays it's middle
linebacker?

                     LM: It is designed for that player in the middle to
make the plays. Either you do or
                     you don't, but you have every opportunity to make the
plays.

                     JH: Roy Williams was the host, how did you enjoy our
visit with him?

                     LM: Roy was pretty depressed about the game, but I was
pretty mad to. We went
                     to a party that night and just hung out. We didn't do
all that much, but we had a
                     great time, because he was such a great guy and all the
players we met were
                     super. Roy is a super person and so are the rest of the
guys as well.

                     JH: Did you come close to committing to OU?

                     LM: I promised my mom I wouldn't commit and I didn't,
but I really enjoyed the
                     visit. However, if signing day was tomorrow I would
sign with OU. OU is out in front
                     of the schools that I have visited thus far. I was
supposed to visit Texas this
                     weekend, but that changed, because they will play for
the Big 12 title. However, I
                     don't know if I am going to visit Texas or not, because
I am finding out they have
                     a lot more depth and commitments than they have been
telling me about. I will
                     visit Florida on December 14th.

                     JH: What did you think of the game?

                     LM: Being a fellow football player I can tell when the
better team isn't winning. That
                     is what happened Saturday. The offense never really got
it going and that happens
                     sometimes. You can't leave your defense on the field
for the whole game. If OU
                     played them 10 times I am not sure OU wouldn't win the
next ten. I my opinion,
                     OU played a bunch of cheerleaders and lost, but it
won't happen again.

                     JH: What did you think of the atmosphere?

                     LM: It's was great and I would love to play in front of
that.

                     JH: Would it take a super visit from one of the teams
ahead for you not
                     to come to OU?

                     LM: I am a shy guy, yet I had so much fun there. The
people were just so nice to
                     me and made me relax and be myself. That is so
important to me and OU has that
                     naturally. can't see anybody beating OU at this point.

OK, so maybe I was a bit optimistic . . . The work on the siding and soffits 
went very slowly, the plumbing was not completed, the paint for the second 
exterior coat did not arrive and the landscaping has been delayed.  According 
to Will Greenough, our construction manager from Habitat, his anticipated 
completion date of December 15 has slipped again to as late as mid January.  
Much of the delay is attributable to complications arising from the concrete 
construction, which made otherwise simple jobs very time consuming.  You 
should have seen the plumbers trying to drill through ten-inch concrete walls!
 
What all this means for us is that we have at least two more weekends of 
work.  If you are free on either November 24 or December 1, or both, please 
come out.  All of us find ourselves in the middle of crowded schedules this 
time of year, so anyone who can make the time to help, even for a half day, 
is very welcome.  We will continue on the siding and soffits, repainting and 
landscaping.  The going is slow, but the house can't be completed without it. 
 Let me know if you will be there so we can plan for food and drink.  We 
won't have van service on November 24, but we can arrange car pools from the 
church if there is any interest.
 
Thanks again to Ken Jones and Martha Cochrum for keeping us well fed.  Also 
to Jeanne Koch for keeping us safe (and not falling off the ladder) and to 
???chainsaw Felker??? for not cutting anything but the trees.  Also to Allene 
Ford for her example of boundless energy and to our crew chiefs, including 
Bob Mahlstedt and Roger Fowler, for getting the job done.  Our site is full 
of the sense of warmth and family that makes St. Paul's such a special place 
for worship. For that, thank you all.
 
If you would like to help in acquiring the washer and dryer for the Franco???s, 
please make a check out to St. Paul???s and indicate that it is for Habitat on 
the memo line.  We received several generous gifts already to make this a 
reality.  You can either give the check to me or send it directly to the 
church.  I will send additional information on the dedication as we get 
closer.
 
Thank you all for your dedication.  If any of you have questions or comments, 
please feel free to respond by return email or call me at 713-748-3317.

still seriously behind schedule and, unless something changes radically, we 
will be entering the 2002 monsoon period with only about two-thirds of the

We have discussed i2 in the past  but we need to take some action steps to 
make decisions and move forward.  Here is what I want to see done in short 
order.

Meeting with all key technologist on the full suite of products and 
functionality with complete demonstration by i2.  I would especially want PB, 
JP, BP, HE, and JG from George's group.
Follow-up meeting (after the technologists see functionality and form 
opinions and possible applications) with key commercial leaders:  GP -  P&P; 
TG - CommodityLogic; BG - Metals and steel;  JF - New Markets and 
Investments; AS - New Markets and Bus Dev.  During that meeting, we need to 
have some real players with i2 there to brainstorm and discuss business 
expansion opportunities in the specific verticals.  It would be good to 
actually have this meeting in Dallas but I am concerned about attendance.  i2 
owns the process and supply/downstream management in these industries and we 
need to really look to see if our combination can accelerate our new efforts 
and solve any logistic issues.
Put together an action plan.  George's group has already put a presentation 
together about i2, the products and possible applications.  George, please 
sent that to John.  I would like that document to be our updated business 
plan for i2 to be used as a ""living"" document as we move forward.
Assign someone to make and co-ordinate the use and full deployment of those 
products (utilize our $10 million spend).  I want someone to have the 
responsibility for i2 and he or she can also work with EBS on what they are 
doing also.  To be clear, we have spent the $10 million already but are not 
using the products.  I want to deploy all (if possible) and make this 
investment fully utilized.  I do understand that we don't drive businesses 
around a pre-purchased product but we should look at is as a sunk cost and 
rationalize why we shouldn't use if rather that simply considering it as an 
option.
Jason Robert, (469) 357-6737, was at the dinner with Sanjiv, Greg Brady, Jeff 
and Greg and he knows some of the mutual objectives.  He would be the guy to 
work with and set it all up.
EBS should be involved as well.  Rex Shelby is spending a lot of time with 
i2, weekly visits, and should also participate and use their products as well.
Is there an application for all of EES and their business?
Remember, Ken Lay is considering joining their board and we should be able to 
give him very clear insight on their products and how their company works.
PB, if you want someone outside Pavetto's group  to work on this that is fine 
but i want to understand the background and how they will make this happen. 


Thanks and please let me know your initial thoughts and timing.  If you need 
to have me send out an email to make sure that everyone understands the 
priority, please draft up and I'll send out.

Our relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several 
important move related items that I would like to stress at this time.  I 
would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined 
below:

IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business 
unit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, 
would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 
8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to 
visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of 
us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please 
contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.
New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  
Any change requests that have already been received are currently being 
considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.
If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 
3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their 
name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH 
7/25
Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed 
by Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related 
issues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for 
the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well 
informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.
Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we 
will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near 
future.
A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The 
Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  
Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent 
phone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if 
you have any questions or issues related to phones.
All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and 
there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or 
people.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space 
available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow 
later):
1 Mega conference room
1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities
1 Large conference room - no videoconference 
3 Team rooms
File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will 
be made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned 
file space as close to each individual group as possible.
At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not 
been resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues 
will be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new 
building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move 
date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries 
and distribution.
Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would 
appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to 
them via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday 
at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make 
arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.
There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the 
new building.

I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of 
questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great 
and everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and 
assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as 
possible.

2476,"First Gas is a liquid fuel supply deal executed in May, 1997 that is linked 
to a power plant in the Phillipines.  Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels 
per day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 2002.  Fuel 
deliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between 
10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was 
booked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced 
consumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual 
losses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.  To make matters 
worse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they 
are going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is 
linked through the end of 2001.

To properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas, 
we need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was 
originally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 
the deal.

In addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April, 
2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.  Per 
conversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level 
for the foreseeable future.

To properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the 
Dubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately 
$3.65.  Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and 
cost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.  We are continuing to 
refine this number and will update you when we get a final amount.

On a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout 
2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to 
justify delaying a writedown.  Given the current market conditions discussed 
above (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that 
their next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is 
going to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas 
before they will sign-off on earnings.  Obviously, I have not recently 
discussed this with AA&Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue.

Please call me if you wish to discuss further.  I appreciate any help you can 
give us in this matter.",John Chismar,"approximately $1 million .70 1.45 2.91 approximately

2480,"Dear Mike:

On Friday, February 23, 2001 we received by fax a copy of the Residential
Construction Contract Mr. Kent intends on using in connection with the
construction of your home.  Upon receipt we noticed that it was not a Cost
Plus Contract.  Therefore, we spoke with him about this matter.  He
indicated that although he believes he will be doing the home on a cost plus
basis, no final agreement regarding this matter had yet been made.

The Residential Construction Contract form he uses is a Greater Houston
Builders Association form which is, for the most part, a good one although
it is written primarily to protect the builder.  Therefore, we may ask that
a number of minor changes be made to the Contract as it relates to notice
requirements to you regarding problems in construction and some changes in
the indemnity language.  In addition, there may be some other changes we
request.  Under any circumstance, we can dictate a letter to Mr. Kent at the
appropriate time.

Mr. Kent also indicated that he will make sure we receive a copy of the Deed
Restrictions as soon as possible.

We assume that you will acquire financing for the construction of the home
itself.  When you close, Flair Construction Co., Inc. will also have to
provide to you a Disclosure Statement which spells out some of your rights
and responsibilities under Texas law and a Contractors List of
Subcontractors and Suppliers which tells you the names and addresses of the
Subcontractors Flair intends on using.  We are sure that the construction
lender will require that these documents be provided at the appropriate
time.

RE: Flair Construction Co., Inc. / Purchase of Lots Six (6) and Seven (7),
Block One (1), THE LAKES OF STERLING GATE, Section One (1)

Dear Mr. & Mrs. McConnell:

Enclosed is a blue lined copy of the Survey we received today from the Title
Company.  Please note that there is a thirty five foot (35') Reliant
Energy/Entex pipeline easement and a fourteen foot (14') utility easement at
the rear of the property.  In addition, the fourteen foot (14') utility
easement runs along the northwest property line.  As such, no permanent
fixture will be allowed to be built over these easements, including a
swimming pool, gazebo or similar structure.

The Earnest Money Contract provides that you have seven (7) days from the
receipt of the Survey to object in writing to items appearing on the Survey.
However, we do not believe that Flair Construction can alter these
easements in any way, shape or form, and as such, the easements will most
likely remain intact.  If you feel that the easements will impair the
construction of your home, swimming pool or related structures, please
advise us immediately so that we may notify Flair of your objections.  If
the objections are not cured within twenty (20) days after Flair receives
them, in writing, the closing date may be extended.  If, however, the
objections are not cured by the extended closing date, the Contract will
terminate and your earnest money should be refunded to you.  We just wanted
to make sure that you were aware of your rights regarding this matter.

Assuming the easements cause you no problems, you should be ready to close.
We will be happy to schedule a closing with the Title Company and with Flair
if you can provide us with a number of dates that are convenient for both of
you to appear at the closing.  We will be happy to appear as well.

Very truly yours,

2492,"Hi Mark,

I know we spoke about some of these things yesterday, but I thought I'd give you some specifics of the things we would look.  Many of these topics may be tied into the ""Accounting, Administration"" portion of the Word document you sent out.

Finance

- Loan documents* related to the debt financing of the project (especially any covenants or provisions in regard to the transferability of the debt under new ownership)
*If the debt is not specifically tied to this project, then it would be valuable to know what percentage of corporate debt they have allocated to the project.

- Book Value of the Assets 

- CapEx budget going forward (I saw that you already mentioned the need for historical CapEx numbers.)

- Depreciation Schedule of Assets

These are the issues that would be most important to us given all the other subjects that you have already address in your list.

Thanks,

Habitat for Humanity Project
 
 November 26, 2001
 
 If you want to work on a Habitat house this year, next week should be your 
final chance.  Last Saturday, we completed the siding and soffits and most of 
the trim on our house.  What remains should go quickly on December 1 (just in 
time for Christmas shopping). The plumbing was also completed but the 
inspection did not taken place.  By next week, we should have the paint for 
the second exterior coat and the landscaping materials.  In addition, we will 
try to finish the siding, soffits and trim on the Dalferes house.  I asked 
again about interior and exterior doors and windows, but the project is so 
far behind, and the concrete construction requires such different techniques, 
that Habitat wants to wrap up the project with contractors.  From the 
Franco???s standpoint, that's probably a good thing.
 
Please let me know if you can help out on December 1.  Many of you have 
already called or written and I appreciate your diligence.  We will have so 
much to do this weekend, with jobs for all skill levels, that having a crowd 
would not be a hindrance. The landscaping and exterior painting will also be 
a great opportunity to get some more kids involved.  If you can help, even 
for a half day, you will be very welcome.  We will plan for food and drink 
again and the lunchtime party is worth the price of admission (Thanks Ken!).  
Also, please let me know if we will need van or car pool service. 
 
While you are considering your schedules, don't forget the dedication for the 
home when it is completed.  Once we know when the Franco???s can move in, we 
will schedule a get together with them to dedicate the house and hold an 
informal celebration.  Second, we will present a housewarming gift of a 
clothes washer and dryer through Habitat.  If you would like to help in 
acquiring the washer and dryer, please make a check out to St. Paul???s UMC and 
indicate ???Habitat??? on the memo line.  Finally, Habitat is planning to build 
50 homes next year, and has to complete 42 of them by September in order to 
meet the terms of the HUD loans used to acquire the land.  The homes will be 
of traditional frame and siding construction, and Habitat is gearing up for 
another intensive building program.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in the build, and whether you want to assist in the planning.
 
If any of you have questions or comments, please feel free to respond by 
email or call me at 713-748-3317.
 
See you Saturday!

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.",Dynegy Mark Muller Lance Schuler Robert Eickenroht Mark Haedicke Rob Walls Greg Whalley,,Enron Dynegy
2501,"Nissho Iwai (project Sato):  We have spent a considerable amount of time over 
the last couple of weeks defining what Enron could do for them and building a 
level of trust and understanding.  Recall that a couple of their board 
members had come to us about a month ago to discuss a USD2-3 billion near 
term liquidity ""issue"".  On Friday their strategy planning group will be 
taking the proposal of cooperation with Enron to their president and some of 
their key advisors at Sanwa Bank and DKB.  We have proposed the means 
(without specific definition) of how we could provide near term liquidity and 
set the path to look for opportunities in key business areas.  Almost all the 
areas of interest are in key Global Market products.  Sanwa and DKB are part 
of the equation as they worked out a rescue deal for NI a year ago.  This 
plan also had the support from Hiyami (former NI president and now head of 
BOJ).  So any decision to handle their near term problems and future growth 
would have to get support from these key groups.  The NI team we have been 
working with seem quite positive on their prospects of getting this through 
Friday's meeting.  From this point we would proceed with a very detailed due 
diligence effort across key areas which will be mutually defined, but 
would/could include: LNG, coal, petchems, shipping, freight, metals, etc.  We 
would determine how much we could pay for certain rights and/or positions.  
If we could get something done this would have a huge impact on the market 
and would give us tremendous reach to other Japanese customers in their 
group.  During this ""liquidity solution"" phase, we will also be evaluating 
areas of growth and of mutual interest to our companies.

Hitachi: weather ventures: The #3 guy in Hitachi came to us a couple of weeks 
ago indicating that they thought there could be tremendous possibilities for 
Enron and Hitachi to jointly market weather products in Japan.  Note:  we 
have been discussing possibilities with Hitachi since Ken Lay visited.  
Hitachi does not have any weather experience, but does have a tremendous 
customer base, a large sales force and a very strong name in Japan.  As 
Hitachi are involved in just about everything, they also have business lines 
in the capital markets area and insurance.  Hitachi senior management has 
strongly implied that if we can get something done then they can deliver 
quite a few companies including the large utilities.  They could also give us 
access to the Japanese insurance companies... beyond the Marine and Fires.  I 
believe that the president of Hitachi has already decided that they want to 
do this.  In fact, in true Japanese style, they have mentioned to TEPCO that 
they would be pursing something like this with Enron to ""sort of"" get 
permission.  Hitachi could be quite useful in getting us further access to 
the utes for fuel deals as well.  What we have contemplated (and discussed 
with Tawney) is an arrangement where Enron provides the pricing for standard 
and structured products and takes on the risk of transactions (risk books 
outside venture) while Hitachi provides the customers and a trained sales 
force.  In return, Hitachi gets some sort of agency fee for each deal done.  
Hitachi also has tremendous weather risk themselves that they would be 
looking to manage from a corporate level.  They have wanted to race to an 
MOU, but we have brought them back to a CA first.  We'll be getting more 
definition over the next couple of weeks with the idea of having advanced and 
productive discussion with Tawney when he is over the middle of next month.  
Needless to say, getting something like this done with Hitachi would be a 
tremendous boost to our local credibility and would open many doors.

Nissho Iwai: methanol:  We will be presenting an indicative term sheet to 
Deutsche Bank tomorrow concerning a prepay structure for 100k+ tons of 
Methanol for up to three years out of Bontang.  We have been able to work 
down the CDS spreads from the international market for Indonesia and NI down 
from 1750 bps over Libor to approx 600.  The structure would likely involve a 
trade finance arrangement with one of the Japanese banks (with sufficient 
Bank of Indonesia deposits) providing coverage for the Bank of Indonesia who 
would provide the local performance gtee.  This is a unique arrangement that 
the Jp banks have with Indonesia.  Also the general feeling amongst Jp 
trading companies and banks is that they are already pregnant with Indonesia 
and a little more doesn't matter.  Basically Indonesia is in the national 
security interest of Japan and therefore Jp govt and institutions will 
provide support.  I have mentioned the possibility of this to Stu to consider 
other ways to manage coal risks.  Prepay would likely be in the range of 
USD30-40 million.  Nowlan has indicated the possibility of greater volumes, 
so will work variables as we get feedback from NI/DB.  For a more detailed 
discussion see internal writeup:

age 7 ) and would be very interested in helping with your group.  Not really 
sure what I can accomplish with EGM from my Charleston, WV location but know 
that I am interested.

Kids are my concern as well.  In fact, I am coaching my sons soccer team and 
have a 5 year old diabetic on my team.

Just a thought for you.................I have been on an insulin pump for the 
past 7 years and it has made a tremendous difference for my life.  Certainly 
worth exploring if you are not using one.  Also, my brother ( Bank of America 
employee ) is on the ADA board for the Southeast region if you may wish to 
contact him about speakers ( doctors ).

Having said the above, I pledge $ 250.00 for the cause.

2504,"It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please

still seriously behind schedule and, unless something changes radically, we 
will be entering the 2002 monsoon period with only about two-thirds of the 
breakwater complete.  DPC may not be able to take its 2002 volumes and will 
either face take-or-pay or (hopefully) force3 majuere relief if the 
breakwater delay can be attributed to construction force majeure.

This will be both a problem and an opportunity for us, because we may be able

2521,"FYI

Pursuant to our conversation earlier today on the marketing strategy for incremental delivery capacity at SoCal Needles, Michelle and I researched the contracts with primary deliveries at PG&E Topock.  Following is a list of the discounted rate shippers to Topock:

PG&E Trading
40,000 MMBtu/d
$0.10.75


SMUD
10,000 MMBtu/d
$0.17

(There are no shippers with EOC delivery points who would move their delivery point to Topock on a primary basis.)

Attached is the contracted volume data for PG&E Topock from Pipeline Profile.

2522,"Just an FYI...

When I fax you a CAF (Contract Approval Form) you are approving that specific deal to be tendered to the Shipper.  You only need to FAX back the actually CAF signature page unless you have changes/corrections; not the ENTIRE agreement.  My FAX number is 713-646-8085.  If you send it somewhere else, I probably won't get it.  Thanks for the prompt reviews.  It's going to take a while but the process is getting faster and we're definitely following the ETS Contracts Policy MUCH better.

SoCal's balance was 151,133 mmbtus at 8/31/01.  Their balance is 300,521 mmbtus at 9/23/01.

We have received 33,130 mmbtus in payback from Williams through the 23rd which has decreased their balance to 242,260 mmbtus.

PG&E Topock's balance is 69,727 mmbtus due TW as of 9/23/01.


The index has decrease by about eighty cents during September which will cause a loss on volumetric oba's.

2597,"Hey Debra,

Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following:
V17258.1
V17337.1
V17515.1

They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.  From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.

Thanks
 ",Hey Debra Kaztex,,Nicor Energy Nicor
2598,"Hi Jimbo,  how are you?

You can tell that we're real busy at the present as evidenced by my timely response.  In answer to your question, we are still in a holding pattern.  We don't have much information, other that the same information that you see.  I would like to say yes, I have a new employer, but it seems a little too early as of yet.  Keep pulling for me, I need all the help I can get.

See ya!

 ",Jimbo,,
2599,"Hi honey,

how are you? Yes, I'm dying to get my gown?  Anytime this weekend, how about bringing it to church on Sunday.  Just put it in your car.

Love ya!

2600,"I did not realize there was a problem.  Pretty bad out there huh?  You really need to get a cell phone for bad weather, you could have been stranded.!

Glad you're there!

 ",,,
2601,"Hey ""G"",  what's up?  I know you will be shocked, but I brought the purse and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this afternoon....so there!  How's it going this morning?

I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching.  It's on options and volatility.  Boy, that stuff does not sink in well with me, I find the class a real challenge.  I'm so uncomfortable in the class.  Pray for me, because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this stuff.  Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its hard to come up with the answers quickly.  It's painful for me....whew!

Talk with you later.......how many days left now?

Love ya

2602,"Hey Girl,

Yes, we had our concert, it was real good, had a very poor turnout, but he 
choir really enjoyed themselves.  Rickey Dillard is a fool!  He's alot of 
fun, and I didn't realize he was gay, but he is.  Everyone says he used to be 
gay, and not he's changed, but......

I spoke with Daddy on Friday, and he asked me where was his e-mail.  I 
haven't heard anything from him as of yet, but I did send him a e-mail asking 
the question.  Did he do his radio program yesterday?

Yesterday, we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback 
riding,  Kendall loved it, Jordan was a little skeptical at first, but soon 
got used to the idea.  I myself was a little skeptical, because I had ol' 
Kendall on my horse, and wanted to hold on to the little know on the saddle, 
instead of me, all I had was the reins,  at first I said ""the hell with 
this"", but it was fun, we'll definitely do it again.

Talk with you later!",Rickey Dillard Kendall Jordan,,
2603,"Thanks for the note, that was very sweet of you.  I always believe in helping 
wherever I can, b/c the next day it'll be me!",,,

Great restaurants, shopping, historical attractions, and more. Take a Fan Fare trip from delta.com and explore a city you might not otherwise visit. Whether you're interested in immersing yourself in nature on the slopes, the arts, or history, Salt Lake City is the perfect destination this weekend. Here are a couple of ideas to get you started.

Ballet West
Ballet West ranks among the premier professional ballet companies in the United States. The company strives to bring new levels of excellence to ballet through innovative choreography, and to present balanced programs representing a broad range of ballet styles. This weekend you can experience two company premieres, Christopher Bruce's Ghost Dances and Hans van Manen's Black Cake. Concluding the program is George Balanchine's tribute to the great composer Igor Stravinsky, Stravinsky Violin Concerto. Located at Capitol Theatre, 50 West 200 South, Salt Lake City.

Temple Square
No trip to Salt Lake City is complete without a long visit to the square that forms the heart of Salt Lake City. You'll find the Family History Library, the Tabernacle, home of the world-famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir, as well as the Temple that gives the square its name. Free tours begin every 5 or 10 minutes at the 100-foot flagpole in the center of this 10-acre block.	   <http://www.delta.com/images/spacer.gif>

2631,"The first invoice for $5.4 million went out a couple of weeks ago.  CES came 
back to us and said they were not going to pay.  They claimed that the total 
of all of the invoices to this date that they have already paid had covered 
that amount.  I have researched all of their invoices, and it looks like 
there was a demand invoice in the system for the month of June for 
approximately $6 million to much.  CES incorporated a credit for that invoice 
in with the charge for $5.4 million, netting out to approximately $600,000.  
I am meeting with CES on Thursday to see if we are in agreement.  The other 
invoice for $7.5 million was sent out last week, CES is in agreement and the

Sorry that we did not get to meet last week when you were in town.  I have 
pulled up some information on the project performance and wanted to share 
with the group.  I was very concerned by the comment that the project was on 
a rate to cost TW an additional $1.0 million for the year because the demand 
avoidance program was not in place.  I do want to confirm that Arnold 
Eisenstein at ET&S working on the development of the programming to support 
TW's efforts to minimize demand expenses.  It was my understanding during the 
development of this project, that TW was targeting a 75% avoidance for an 
annual basis.   I offer the following details regarding the actual operation 
of the station in 2000.

2689,"Recent message from China Jonny:


Howdy! We haven't moved yet to Nanjing, I was just there for work purposes.
Will be moving there in late August (probably August 23-25). It's been
rainy/cloudy here in SE China for the last three days, a wonderful respite
from the furnace like heat of the past six weeks. The countryside from
Shanxi all the way down to Jiangsu province was choked with varying shades
of green. Even Shanxi province has received some rain this summer; this
helps mitigate the effects of a three-year drought they've suffered through
recently.

Had a good 4-day weekend in Taiyuan. We had a big dinner party for Ai Ping's

father on his 65th birthday. This party also served as mini-wedding
reception for us and the Shang family's close friends. Both of Ai Ping's
parents are from Henan province. One of Ai Ping's uncles works for her
brother in the steel business. Essentially, he's a good-hearted,
hardworking, farmer from the Shang family's ancestral home village. Northern

Chinese peasants are world famous for their ability to drink gallons of rice

liquor, and I was witness to a fascinating display of this sort. The uncle
must have consumed about a liter of various alcohols including the local
moonshine, a bottle of Jim Beam that I brought, and lots of Qingdao beer.

He was the king of China for an hour; people were rolling on the floor with
his antics. The wait staff of the restaurant even stopped working to observe

him bouncing off the walls in drunken glee. He drank two large whiskey and
cokes within minutes and stated,""It's just like drinking a cool glass of
water!"" to the delight of the revelers. Of course, disaster eventually
struck. He hadn't eaten enough food, and his poor liver couldn't process the

tidal wave of booze. First, his head went bonk onto the table. People ran
for cover expecting the worst. He wretched under the table. Ai Ping's
parents were obviously embarresed, but didn't lose too much face because
everyone was friends or family.

We're hoping to make a trip back to the USA in early October if all goes as
planned. Is this a good time for your guys? China has its National Day
holiday (one week) in the first week of October. We would leave China around

the 29-30th of September and make it a one week trip back to the states. The

Wuxi school is obligated to reimburse me for two, round-trip plane tix. I
need to use them before I lose them. This summer's work schedule didn't
allow me any time off. Let me know if this is a good week for you guys.

Dad, we'll need your assistance in obtaining a tourist visa for Ai Ping. You

and Mom will need to write a ""letter of invitation"" for Ai Ping explaining
the reason for her travels to the US (ie. an Iowan wedding reception). The
person who invites the Chinese national to the US must also do one of two
things according to the US Embassy's website in Beijing: either provide tax
information from the last 2-3 years OR fill out and sign the I-134 form
which guarantees your economic situation. Unfortunately, you're going to be
involved in some more beaurocratic bliss in order for us to get Ai Ping her
travel visa. My sincere apologies. We've begun collecting documents here on
the China side for the same purpose. I'll do some more net research
concerning this issue, and try to provide you with more info. However,
please start preparing these documents if possible. Once Ai Ping is issued a

tourist visa to the states, travels there, and returns she'll have a much
easier time obtaining the next visa in the future because she'll prove to
the INS that she's not an immigration threat. Thank you for your assistance
in these matters.

That's all for now. Will write again in near future with more info. Hope all

clan members are healthy and in good spirits...

Love,

Jon

2703,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.",QNEC,,Enron Board of Directors Enron Corp. Savings Plan Plan QNEC Company Matching http://resources.hewitt.com/enron benefits.enron.com

2741,"As you all know, on September 1st, Wildhorse indicated (verbally to me)  they 
did not feel that contractually they had the obligation to deliver 
Crescendo's San Arroyo (Dakota) production to ""any pipeline we choose""; i.e., 
Northwest P/L.  

Since this verbal conversation, we have sent a written clarification 
reiterating our position (as well as had numerous verbal discussions) and 
have now nominated Crescendo's October production to be delivered into 
Northwest P/L.  Also since this above conversation, Wildhorse has said they 
will clarify their legal/contractual position and respond back to us.

Numerous calls by Mark Whitt and myself have not been returned....until 
today, during lunch.  Kent Harris of Wildhorse finally returned our calls 
(... probably hoping to catch me at lunch), and he said the following:

""I'm still waiting on our legal review of the contract and hope to have it 
this afternoon""  (its now 5pm; no call).  ""While I agree with your 'first 
queue' contractual rights and therefore we have to take all your gas up to 10 
MM/d, I don't agree with your claim to have the right to take the gas to any 
available delivery point"".

My response: ""Kent, that is the cleanest provision in this contract.""  [Then 
I read back Section 3 of the contract...""or any other connection with a 
mainline carrier downstream of the tailgate of the Mesa (San Arroyo) 
Plant...""].

He responded: ""That's your opinion; we'll see what my legal counsel says.""

I responded that nominations were due tomorrow, we sent our nomination to 
Wildhorse today for delivery into NWPL, and for October and beyond our market 
is on NWPL.  September 1st was when Wildhorse made the delivery point 
location an issue; now its Sept. 26th (the day before nominations are due) 
and we've gotten no other response from Wildhorse after we clarified our 
position numerous times both verbally and in writing!

Again, he said he'd try to get back with me asap.

On the Entrada project, he did say that they have redesigned the proposed 
route (based on our ideas and requests) and feel that the capital required 
for the project will be significantly reduced.  They hope to have a revised 
proposal to Crescendo soon.

[Gerald and I still are not clear where under the contract they are claiming 
the right to send us a proposal/renegotiate, but that's for another meeting.]

Mark Whitt and/or I will follow-up upon any further developments.

engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.

I would suggest you try to steer the conference described below to a lawyer 
only conference call on the document review (of our draft of the Lease and 
any specific problems they might have with it).  If you would like me to sit 
in on other otherwise help with that call I would be glad to.  My view is 
that Mariner is liable to Marathon for all manner of issues under the PHA and 
that MEGS wants Marathon to ""substitute"" those liability and indemnity rights 
for the ones typically running against a Lessee in a Platform Lease 
Agreement.  I don't exactly follow the privity agrument he that Brad makes 
below, but if he's right, there's no problem in removing references to the 
MEGS/Mariner O&M Agreement from the Lease--The fundamental principal remains: 
Marathon should look tom Mariner and to Burlington (as a PHA ratifier) for 
relief.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Private Investors Align to Upgrade California's Path 15;=20
Project Causes New State / Federal Conflicts=20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] The federal government has reached a deal with a c=
oalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central Califo=
rnia under a $300-million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving=
 electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state.=
 Construction on the so-called Path 15 project, which was announced by Ener=
gy Secretary Spencer Abraham, will begin in the spring of 2003 and could be=
 completed by as early as summer 2004. =20
Analysis: The California energy crisis, which clearly subsided over the sum=
mer of 2001 due to new generation that came online in the state, mild weath=
er patterns and conservation efforts, is generally considered the result of=
 a severe supply / demand imbalance. While this may be true, what often get=
s overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the state-the lines=
 that actually transport power from point A to point B-also played a primar=
y role in creating the tremendous instability of California's energy market=
. This problem still persists today, and as California heads into the winte=
r season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing. The Dep=
artment of Energy (DOE) has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing=
 a massive upgrade to California's main transmission line. While this is a =
positive step, the upgrade creates a new level of state / federal disputes =
for California and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into th=
e hands of private companies, which creates a whole new set of potential co=
nflicts.=20
Amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the Path 15 upgrade, there a=
re some things that we know for sure. First, Path 15, which is owned by Pac=
ific Gas & Electric Co., is a 90-mile high-voltage section of transmission =
capacity that essentially carries power between Northern and Southern Calif=
ornia. During the peak of the energy crisis in California, Path 15 became r=
ather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks (points at which transmission c=
ould not transport high volumes of power). This pre-empted any transport of=
 power from Southern California (and Arizona and Mexico) to the north, whic=
h resulted in rolling blackouts in San Francisco and other Northern Califor=
nia cities. As noted, these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly=
 acute during times of peak power demand, which is obviously a concern as w=
inter approaches. =20
The deficiency of the California transmission systems is arguably the last =
piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the stat=
e's energy market. Ironically, power supply is no longer seen as an imminen=
t problem. New reports from the California ISO indicate that the state shou=
ld have operating reserves of between 2,000 and 2,200 MW this winter, which=
 has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous=
 winter season. However, the report on the state's transmission system is n=
ot as positive. If the Northwest continues to experience a drought, then No=
rthern California will still need to import more power from the south. Heav=
y dependence on the strained Path 15 could once again cause reliability pro=
blems for California.=20
Thus, deficiencies along Path 15 can be seen as a symptom of larger problem=
s that continue to plague California, and problems that have been the focus=
 of both state and federal intervention for months, if not years. In fact, =
there is a history here that is worth noting, especially as it relates to f=
ederal / state jurisdiction. When President Bush released his national ener=
gy plan in April of this year, he directed the DOE to explore efforts that =
would relieve congestion along Path 15. Following through with this order, =
Energy Secretary Abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited respo=
nses from 13 companies interested in participating in the expansion of Path=
 15. The current contract, which will add a new line to the existing Path 1=
5, is the result of that previous directive.=20
At present, it appears that PG?Corp. (NYSE: PCG), the parent of Pacific Gas=
 & Electric Co., and six other companies have signed on to financially supp=
ort the upgrade. The six other companies that will spearhead the project ar=
e the Transmission Agency of Northern California, Trans-Elect, Inc., Kinder=
 Morgan Power Co., PG?National Energy Group, Williams Energy Marketing and =
Trading, and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), a federal agency=
 within the DOE that sells electricity from water projects in 15 western st=
ates and operates 17,000 miles of transmission lines. =20
Presently, Path 15 connects the Bay Area in Northern California to two of t=
he state's largest generation facilities-Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s Diabl=
o Canyon nuclear facility and Duke Energy's Morro Bay natural-gas power pla=
nt. The upgrade will reportedly include a new 500-kilovolt line that would =
boost transmission by about 1,500 MW from these two plants. Further, when t=
he upgrade is finished in 2004, Path 15 should be able to carry a total of =
5,400 MW of power.=20
Of course, the first question that I asked was: Who is going to pay for the=
 upgrade? The way it appears at this writing is that the WAPA will retain 1=
0-percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for=
 acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line. The rema=
ining 90 percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting d=
ifferent amounts of capital to fund the upgrade. The exact percentages of i=
nvestment (and ownership) have yet to be defined, but should be revealed in=
 a subsequent plan outlined in the next 90 days. You may ask why these comp=
anies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in California. Th=
e answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments thr=
ough fees charged to use the new transmission line. This could result in a =
hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project, who presumably ant=
icipate that California will remain a high-demand state through which huge =
amounts of power will need to be transported.=20
As I mentioned, there are some potential conflicts that might arise with th=
is upgrade plan. First, there is the issue of potential state / federal reg=
ulatory conflicts. Presently, state governments have jurisdiction over powe=
r line siting. Thus, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) had =
already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for Path 15 prior to Secretary A=
braham's call for private-company bids. Specifically, the CPUC had directed=
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which it regulates, to upgrade the bottleneck =
spots along Path 15. As seems to be a growing occurrence, we may find that =
there is a state / federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulator=
y body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in Cali=
fornia. Gov. Gray Davis and the CPUC certainly seem to believe that it is t=
he state's prerogative, and have issued strong criticisms over the DOE's ve=
nture into this territory. However, in his energy plan, President Bush seem=
ed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obta=
in transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission ca=
pacity.  If there is indeed a dispute between the CPUC and the DOE, it is n=
ot known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area. In an=
y event, representatives from Trans-Elect, one of the participating compani=
es, have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state =
(and public and private) interests will be one of the key challenges for th=
e upgrade project. Note that Trans-Elect was the company that had unsuccess=
fully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of Southern California =
Edison earlier this year.  =20
Also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the DOE's upgrade plan for=
 Path 15 are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a =
major piece of California's transmission grid. The DOE-sponsored upgrade, u=
nlike the one that the CPUC has directed, reportedly would not be subject t=
o review or approval by either the California ISO or the CPUC. Further, bec=
ause the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the n=
ew line, these companies will be able to charge ""tolls"" to the power market=
ers that use the lines to transport power. This is most likely a point of c=
ontention for California officials, especially Gov. Gray Davis, who has sou=
ght state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on p=
rivate-company ownership of generation facilities in the state. The positiv=
e side of this issue is that, according to the DOE, the bids from private c=
ontracts enable the upgrade of Path 15 to proceed without any increase to ""=
either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of Am=

As a side note, in addition to Path 15 the CPUC is also proceeding with a n=
ew transmission line in Southern California, known as the Valley-Rainbow In=
terconnect transmission line. Although the timetable has been delayed until=
 2005, San Diego Gas & Electric is proceeding with a 500,000-volt transmiss=
ion line that would connect Southern California Edison's Valley Substation =
near Romoland, Calif., with a future substation to be located in the Rainbo=
w, Calif. area, just south of the Riverside-San Diego county line. The new =
transmission line would provide a second interconnection between SDG&E's an=
d SCE's transmission systems. The first interconnection is at the San Onofr=
e Substation near San Clemente, Calif. The project is designed to deliver a=
pproximately 1,000 MW. =20
Moreover, the expansion of Path 15 is a necessary step to help California l=
ower its risk for further reliability problems. Due to generation developme=
nt, the imminent threat of the California energy crisis has diminished, but=
 the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors=
. The state government still has its hand in power purchases, which represe=
nts a huge part of the state's energy market. The state has accrued $12.5 b=
illion in debt to buy power for the state's utilities, the recovery for whi=
ch remains an unresolved issue. While Gov. Davis has preferred to increase =
the state's role in California's energy infrastructure, this new DOE-sponso=
red project on Path 15 puts ownership of transmission assets into the hands=
 of private companies. =20

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""twea=
ks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

2862,"Good afternoon, everyone.

I have some good news to share with you. There will be no new assignments!
We are hoping you will take the time this week to finish up past
assignments. In addition, we are working on some of your past assignments
and all future assignments by cutting/pasting from the course material that
we have received from Enron HR. We will be asking you to review these
assignments and update them as necessary. You will still be responsible for
reviewing and granting final sign-off the topics.

Assignment Status:
Berney Aucoin:  We are working with Errol McLaughlin from Jeff Gossett's
group to help with the remaining Accounting & Reporting topic assignments.
We still need your last three assignments from the Organization Structure
topic because current courses we have available to us do not cover this
content. They include write-ups about:
     Roles and Responsibilities of Mid-Marketers / Origination
     Roles and Responsibilties of Traders
     Structure of a Trading Organization
Please let us now when you will be able to send these to us. Thanks.

Mark Reese: We have been able to find information for the ""Risk Management""
portion of your 10/26 assignment and your future assignment. Eventually, we
will need you to review what we have put together. In addition, we still
need your last four assignments because current courses we have available
to us do not cover this content in detail. They include write-ups about:
     Marking to Market, Pricing Models (10/19), Technical Analysis (10/26),
     Fundamental Analysis (11/2) and VaR (11/9) for the Risk Management
     Inputs topic
     Pricing of Hedging Instruments (11/2) (high-level process and
     discussion about bid/mid/offer) from the Hedging Basics topic

Ed McMichael: Thank you for your handing in most of your assignments on
time! As we discussed, you accidently left out your write-up on ""Additional
Types of Risks"" (11/2) and are going to send that to us this week. You also
have the ""Natural Gas Markets"" assignment (11/9) outstanding that the
Research group is working on. Please forward us that assignment when you
recieve it.  The only assignments that are remaining for your topics are
about Crude Oil and Electiricty Markets. We are working on finding course
material/resources to help write these. Let us know if you find any leads
for these assignments. Moving forward, we will be requesting your review
and final sign-off on the topic.

Dutch Quigley: We are going to cut/paste the information for the Futures
and Options topics from BRM. I think that Futures will require little time
for your review, but we will need you to spend some time reviewing the
Options topic and providing examples for both topics. We will be contacting
you in the near future to schedule a couple of meetings to review and
sign-off on this work.

Andy Lewis:  We are going to cut/paste the information for the Forwards and
Options topics from BRM. I think that Forwards will require little time for
your review, but we will need you to spend some time reviewing the Swaps
topic and providing examples for both topics. We will be contacting you in
the near future to schedule a couple of meetings to review and sign-off on
this work.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

ony Wright  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Wright didn't practice=
 Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicat=
ed Wright might not play Sunday.   Wright expected to have results of an MR=
I exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the qu=
arterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo sai=
d Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to pl=
ay Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the =
Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to=
 merit a starting spot yet.        Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Lake Austin Mi=
ghty Mullets Updated 10/24/01   Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee s=
urgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday whe=
n told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and =
could be lost for the season.   ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to =
play this Sunday,"" Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains=
 sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two w=
eeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questi=
onable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - Team T-Bo=
ne Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be bench=
ed in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toom=
er is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eag=
les and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fas=
sel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayne Chr=
ebet  , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sunda=
y's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chr=
ebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra ca=
utious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and=
 scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-ol=
d rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past ye=
ar. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catc=
h for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Update=
d 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-ev=
aluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert E=
manuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the Det=
roit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help=
 fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanue=
l won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    Hin=
es Ward  , WR PIT - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day wi=
th an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tenn=
essee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Team T-Bone Updated 10/24/01   The De=
troit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patell=
a tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ=
 - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is stil=
l a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The =
earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB -=
 Water Boys Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to gene=
ral soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully r=
ecovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Team T-Bone Up=
dated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to th=
e starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still wor=
king with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which pl=
ayer will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - =
Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster =
is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. =
Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leag=
ues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robi=
nson  , WR CHI - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson=
 on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effect=
ively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Ne=
il Rackers  , K CIN - South Park Cows Updated 10/24/01   According to the C=
incinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign=
 one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk becaus=
e of his erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - The Replacements Update=
d 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunda=
y's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR N=
YG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sp=
rained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week=
.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/24/01   Ike H=
illiard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the =
role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's abs=
ence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance =
that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer ha=
s been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few=
 times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swi=
nton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a =
hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He=
 [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he d=
idn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave=
 Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in h=
is absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/24/=
01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Ca=
rdinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is=
 recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice to=
morrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will =
depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave=
 Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   C=
hiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game agai=
nst the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.     Raghib Ism=
ail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering from a spr=
ained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable=
 for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - The Replacements Updat=
ed 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mi=
ke Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as=
 he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that br=
idge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't =
insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt.=
 Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that wh=
en Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would=
 be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if W=
atters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Trent Dilfer =
 , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to practice on =
Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasse=
lbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    Matt Hasse=
lbeck  , QB SEA - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck =
will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami,=
 according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, wh=
o stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn=
't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so d=
on't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Update=
d 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's=
 game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent o=
f the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR =
MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a =
foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a u=
seful Fantasy player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA =
- Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an =
ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be a=
fraid to use him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated=
 10/23/01   Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might st=
art ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't=
 recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' seconda=
ry is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter th=
is week.    Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01 =
  Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to =
a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR I=
ND - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday'=
s game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in=
 a Fantasy league this week.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]=
   CYSWC Player News    Joe Nedney  , Active K Updated 10/23/01  Nedney suf=
fered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.    =
Chris Chandler  , Reserve QB Updated 10/22/01  Chandler had another solid g=
ame Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and 39 yards. He also completed =
14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to be an adequate starter for t=
he rest of the season.    Darnay Scott  , Active WR Updated 10/22/01  Scott=
 suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss next w=
eek's game against Detroit.    J.R. Redmond  , Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01 =
 Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry =
for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.   =
 Maurice Smith  , Active RB Updated 10/22/01  Smith suffered a sprained kne=
e Sunday but is expected to play in the Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a b=
ye this week and doesn't play again until November 4.    Derrick Alexander =
 , Active WR Updated 10/21/01  Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99=
 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for =
the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes i=
t tough to bench him.    Desmond Clark  , Reserve TE Updated 10/21/01  Clar=
k had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score ag=
ainst San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy =
perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.    Corey Dillon  ,=
 Active RB Updated 10/21/01  The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 c=
arries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performa=
nce very quickly.    Derrick Mason  , Active WR Updated 10/21/01  Mason (an=
kle) is expected to start on Sunday against Detroit. With the Lions' second=
ary in shambles, starting Mason is a good decision for Fantasy owners with =
a thin group of receivers.    Jeff Garcia  , Active QB Updated 10/18/01  Ac=
cording to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a f=
ootball until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealin=
g with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and brui=
ses. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. =
28 against Chicago.    Antowain Smith  , Reserve RB Updated 10/18/01  Smith=
 rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this yea=
r. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second=
 meeting with Indianapolis.    Chad Lewis  , Active TE Updated 10/18/01  Le=
wis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday=
 against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and shoul=
d be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.    Antonio Freeman  , Reser=
ve WR Updated 10/14/01  Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD aga=
inst Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear =
signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet s=
tart prior to this week.    Raiders  , Active DT Updated 10/02/01  The Raid=
ers have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore h=
is Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery th=
is week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In ot=
her news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dal=
las Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is qu=
estionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   =
 Bills  , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01  Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunda=
y's game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist inj=
ury. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and h=
is return is questionable.    Ricky Proehl  , Reserve WR Updated 08/19/01  =
Proehl has been dealing with a slight hamstring injury in recent days, acco=
rding to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . The injury isn't considered serious,=
 however, and Proehl is expected to be ready for the start of the regular s=
eason.    Adam Vinatieri  , Reserve K Updated 12/13/00  Vinatieri has been =
one of the league's most accurate placekickers in recent weeks, converting =
on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his chances against=
 the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense struggles like it did=
 on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's elite kickers on your=
 roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 20=

2885,"With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

The casino cake is basically a rasberry lovers cake...the decorative rings
are a thin layer of biscuit (cake) with raspberry jam on it..then it is
rolled up and sliced thin to get those little circular designs.  You line a
pan with those rings, then fill the pan partially with bavarian creme
(vanilla flavored cream), a layer of rasperry, then more cream, then a layer
of sponge cake....it is interesting...my top pic is our chocolate  pistachio
and the cheesecake which needs to be added to the album.

schedulers
will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific
point.    The AGL volumes are not current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in

get in the ""properly pumped"" zone.  Turns out there are a lot of classmates
on the peninsula - David Park, Frank Knifsend, Mary, and James Regan come to
mind immediately.

No real news here.  We haven't broken anything in the house in a while, so
either we're getting luckier or we're due.  Both jobs are very busy right
now so the weekends are for recuperating.  This weekend, of course, will be

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and
tell Marie we said hi.

The reunion is rapidly approaching!  I think we have been able to get ahold
of just about everyone now, and it looks like there will be a very big
turn-out ... thanks for taking the time to let us know your plans!!   Also,
special thanks to Constantine for doing a bang-up job on recruiting,
especially among the New York contingent!

Now that we have gotten the word out, its time to collect a few bucks to pay
for these great events!  If you haven't already submitted your Registration
you can do so in one of at least two ways:

1)  Return the flyer from the Alumni Office that you received in the mail.
This has pricing for all the events and should be received in plenty of time
if you send it this week or early next.   Note:  if you didn't get the
packet, then you probably need to update your info on the alumni database --
go to http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni/.

2)  Register Online by going to the Reunion Homepage at
http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/alumni/reunions.html  (note:  this is a link to
the main Reunion site with info on all events).   There is a secure form
there with all the pricing, info and a credit card processing function.
Nice!

Either way should work, please note that you will only be able to do the
Online Registration through Oct 31st so please get on it!

Couple of points of clarification regarding the pricing and events!

1)  You will see reference to two separate events happening the same
weekend, the Alumni Conference and the various Class Reunions (1996, 1991,
1986, etc)!   Just think of all these events as one series of activities
designed for your reunioning pleasure and pick and choose what you would
like to attend w/ special attention to anything that says ""Class of 1996"".
For a list of all events, visit the Reunion web site (link shown above).

2)  You will notice that there are two BBQ lunches on Saturday.  There is a
Class of 1996 event at Will Rogers State Park, and there is a separate event
on the North Lawn at UCLA for everyone else.  You can attend either event
(or both for that matter), but I would encourage you to go to the Class of
1996 event because that is where all of your friends will be!

3)  Pricing for the events is listed on the Registration page, but a quick
summary is as follows (simplified version):

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of ""zeros"" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

There has been an MVP who reveived the award two years in a row at each position (center field has two), including at pitcher.  Name them.  

I will share the answers in a future email.  I'm thinking Bert or DiLeo are the only ones who have half a chance at this one.  Prove me wrong.

Pitcher :[Claffey, Jim] Roger Clemens

Catcher:[Claffey, Jim] Yogi Berra (this is a lock)

First Base: (no it was not Rich Kampmann)[Claffey, Jim] I was gonna guess you!  How about Gehrig? Carew?

Second Base:[Claffey, Jim]   I haven't a clue but will stab at Joe Morgan (only because I liked that thing he did with his armpit when he batted.  My brothers and I learned to make the farting noise with our arms from him!

Third Base:[Claffey, Jim] Mike Schmidt (No doubt about this one)

Short Stop:[Claffey, Jim] Robin Yount?

Left Field:[Claffey, Jim] Mickey Mantle 

Center Field:[Claffey, Jim] Joe Dimaggio and Dale Murphy (I had help on Murphy from some Braves fans)

Right Field:[Claffey, Jim] Roger Maris ?

This has to be one of the *ugly* games of the year.  The only saving
grace (and it isn't much of one either) is that the winner gets to say
they won their last game.  For Cal, that would be their only win.  I'm

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

2953,"Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an ""official"" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the ""Sunday Update"" link (near the bottom).  Login is ""enron"", Password is ""enron"".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...

Did you watch the Astros / Giants game last night.  It was embarrassing.  I've never
seen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team (of course I'm talking abt the
Astros).  When do you ever walk a guy with runners on 1st and 2nd, your team is 
down by 1 run and there is 2 outs?  Answer:  NEVER.  According to Dierker,
""... the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second,"" Dierker said. ""We did that because Jeff Kent was 3-for-17 against Williams and had struck out the last five at-bats (against him), so he showed some dominance against him. Obviously, you don't want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason, and we did.

How's long's this clown been managing.  I guess he hasn't followed Kent the last few years.  It wasn't like he was walking Bonds to get to 
Ivan DeJesus.  He doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up.  I've never seen fans boo their home team so much since the days of Michael Jack.

Have you and Patty been getting any sleep? How's Jack?

2998,"Peter, just a follow-up to your email.

1.  I would agree that OPG is mistaken.  After the meeting, Chris and I and 
others started the process of explaining to Joel Sheinfied, a contract 
administrator, why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial 
settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be 
delivered power.  On this issue I think it would be helpful to present OPG w/ 
a product definition that works with the physical master.  I know Chris is 
already working on this.  From what it sounds like, the Ontario pool is not 
that different from NEPOOL.  In UI, Chris worked on a product definition that 
you could incorporate into the physical master.

2. I also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and 
there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single MW flowing).   
This is what we did in UI.  This is what we do in the California pool.  This 
is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL.  I think the EEI fm gets you to the same 
place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree 
that the language could be more direct.  With the California product (CAISO 
energy) we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things 
we also have to fix.  We likely in the future will also modify fm for the 
NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in 
the US that this is a change for the near future.  In general, fm is unique 
to the product and I believe will change with each product.  When Chris and I 
were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the 
Ontario product would be just as you stated:  Fm is only possible if the pool 
fails.  Just FYI, the god awful ""Into""product in the US was created by Enron 
for the very reason you stated: we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool 
market - we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to 
change delivery points (and not be allowed to call a fm) within the defined 
control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was 
unavailable.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Freight Markets
Enron Freight Markets (EFM) launched its over-the-road trucking business this week.  In addition, EFM completed 199 intermodal transactions in the first week of April.

ENA West Power
ENA West Power recently closed the sale of two power projects.  The 750MW Pastoria Energy Facility in Kern County, California was sold to Calpine and the 240MW Fountain Valley Power project in Colorado was sold to Black Hills Energy Capital.  Given the power shortage in the West, ENA is developing additional power generation in Nevada, California and Washington.

Enron Industrial Markets
The newsprint group of EIM is working to revolutionize the newsprint market and bring financial rigor and market efficiencies to a business that has remained relatively unchanged for more than a century. The global newsprint market is a 23 billion dollar a year business with the North American market comprising one third.  The group's originators, mid-marketers, and financial and physical traders offer our customers numerous financial and physical products not previously available in the market. 

EIM has made a substantial commitment to this business with the purchase of Garden State Paper company last year and the recent purchase of Daishowa Paper in Quebec City. The number of transactions has grown exponentially with the physical trading alone reaching a nominal trading volume of more than $10,000,000 per month in little more than four months since opening.  In addition to physical spot transactions, the desk offers our counterparties log-term fixed priced transactions, indexed based pricing, forward contracts, swaps, and derivative products.

Forest Products
Forestweb Inc., an Internet-based generator, aggregator and integrator of knowledge and information for the forest products industry, announced a new window to industry financial and risk management tools available from Clickpaper.com. Clickpaper allows the industry direct access to transactable prices for both physical and financial products, in an electronic format.

Ken Lay was the cover story for the April 2001 issue of Continental Magazine.  He had positive things to say about his employees.

""Sitting in his 50th floor mahogany-paneled office overlooking his much-beloved downtown Houston, Lay, with a self-conscious smile, bows his head slightly as he's described as an innovative market maker.  'I really can't take any credit, he says. My employees are responsible for what Enron does.'  What he does best, the Missouri-born corporate icon says, is 'to create an atmosphere of empowerment and creativity and hire bright, innovative people who aren't afraid to take risks and try new things.""

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Poland obtains Gas Trading License
On 22nd March 2001 Enron Poland received a 10-year Gas Trading License, valid for both domestic gas trading within Poland as well as for gas exports.  The license is a key component to our entering the gas trading market in Poland and, coupled with the Power Trading License we obtained in 1999, will give Enron Poland a strong position in the developing wholesale energy market.  In the next two to three weeks, we expect to receive a cross-border trading license covering gas imports that are further regulated under the Polish Energy Law Ordinance on Gas Import Diversification.

	Richard,

	This will acknowledge receipt of and thank you for the above-referenced referral.  You told me that we were to act as first-chair trial counsel in this matter, and instructed me to retain local counsel immediately.

	On the recommendation of Susman & Godfrey and Willy Wood of Fulbright & Jaworski, and with Jim Derrick's authority, I am happy to report that I have retained Lazaro Garza-Gongora of Laredo as local counsel for us in this matter, at his usual hourly rate of $175, and a retainer of $5,000, to be applied by him against his fees and expenses.   By acting quickly on this, we eliminated the risk of the remaining defendants snapping up all available local counsel and being forced to beg for a share of one.  I would of course be willing to consider sharing Lazaro (and his fees) with other defendants, but with the understanding that in the event of a conflict, Lazaro would only represent us, and would be allowed to stay in the case. 

	I anticipate that there will be a comprehensive joint defense agreement in this matter and that both local counsel and experts, including gas measurement experts, may be shared.  I will be speaking with you shortly about retaining a gas measurement expert.

	Lazaro is going to the courthouse to review the court's file and will report shortly on what he finds.

	Please let me know how you want Lazaro's bills handled.

	Please let me know who needs to be in the reporting loop on this one.

	As always, we greatly appreciate the chance to work with you.

	I will keep you closely advised.

3060,"The FERC ""Westwide"" order issued at approximately 8 p.m. EDT Tuesday and per the order is effective begining 6/20/01.  It is available at http://www.ferc.gov/electric/bulkpower.htm.

A few hard copies are at my desk in Portland.

",,,FERC
3061,"The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting.  We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues. Generally, the order is expected to expand the scope of the Commission's April 26 Order, and this report will highlight the differences.

Geographical Scope-  Mitigation is extended to cover all 11 western states.

Term- The term of the order will be extended to cover 2 summers.  We expect the order to issue today.  If so, the order will take effect at midnight tonight and continue in effect until 9/30/02.

Spot Market- Defined as sales of 24 hours or less, transacted on the day of delivery or the day prior to delivery.

Must Sell- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will require all sellers to offer all their available power in real time.  All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market.   Sellers in the rest of the WSCC are similarly required to sell, except that they are not required to sell into California and can choose their spot market.  They will be required to post available power on the Western Systems Power Pool board.  Hydroelectric facilities will continue to be exempted.  

Price Mitigation-  Expanded to be in place 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Applies to all sellers, including marketers and non-public utilities.  The plan retains a single market clearing price auction for the spot market, based on marginal cost bids. The proxy price formula is changed in several respects:

	1.	Gas price will be the average of the mid-point of the monthly bid week prices as reported in Gas Daily 		for Malin, SoCal Gas Large Packages and PG&E City Gate.
	2.	O&M increases from $2 to $6.
	3.	Fuel start-up and emissions costs are eliminated from the formula and uplifted from the ISO (i.e. these 		costs will be recovered from the ISO, but will not go into setting the proxy price).
	4.	Similarly, a credit adder of 10% will apply, only in CA. 

A reserve deficiency in CA (7% or less) also triggers mitigation for the rest of the WSCC.  The applicable price during reserve deficiency periods is the proxy price outlined above.  During times when no reserve deficiency exists, the mitigated price will be 85% of the highest price calculated in the last Stage 1 emergency.  This price will be in effect until the next Stage 1 emergency.  Sellers can bid higher than the proxy, with justification, during periods of reserve deficiency or when no reserve deficiency exists; PROVIDED THAT MARKETERS MAY NOT BID ABOVE THE PROXY PRICE.  FERC will consider the entire portfolio of a seller who seeks to justify a higher price than the proxy.  Generators may seek cost based rates for their entire portfolio in CA if they so choose (i.e. no cherry picking).

Demand Side Management- The plan originally set forth in the April 26 order is expected be removed in this order. 

ISO Reporting- ISO will need to report on a quarterly basis as to the status of building supply in CA. 

Comments- Comments will be sought on the issue of whether the price mitigation formula should be adjusted in response to expected varying load conditions due to seasonal changes.

Settlement Conference-  The settlement judge will convene a settlement conference on the refund issue no later than June 25 (next Monday) and the parties will have 15 days to settle.  A report from the judge to the Commission is due 7 days thereafter (for a total of 22 days).

Issues that are NOT expected to be addressed in the order include confidentiality, ISO board issues, ISO scheduling penalty application, and market based rate authorization.  The Order is not finally issued as of yet, and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of a Final Order.  We will keep you posted.

3063,"All,

It is my understanding that transmission stacking was to be used when
aggregating multiple OASIS reservations from the same transmission provider
on a single tag.  The stacking of OASIS reservations in descending order of
priority works for a single xmn provider, and the tag author's use of the
descending stacking methodology can be verified by that transmission
provider.  Doesn't using multiple xmn providers eliminate this checking
mechanism?  Or is the idea of the transmission provider verifying the stack
order distasteful?

Finally, is allowing xmn stacking with multiple xmn providers the logical
extension of allowing xmn stacking with one provider?

I hope your day is going well and your trader and thus you are having a good

to a Friday night out when asked out on Wednesday night but I'll let it go

3082,"Hi yourself,

Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the 
impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it 
must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.

Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to 
Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and 
then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and 
then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there 
so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name, 
walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting 
down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they 
had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up 
going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we 
parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell 
phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us 
Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it 
was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him 
one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday 
gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know 
each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the 
best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be 
sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels 
pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run 
through the stats:

Height :   6'2"" - 6'3""
Weight : about 225 lbs.
Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where)
Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it 
may be more of an issue for him than me.
Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA

ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family.
  Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion)
  His dad was in the Navy
  Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of 
humor and likes to laugh
  He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in 
the hill country

Best Quotes:    ""Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in 
jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots."" 
  ""Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has 
an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great    
businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and 
three of them are married.""
  ""Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker 
than any group of women I've ever met.""
  ""I really want to learn how to two step.""
  
So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive 
characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every 
capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you 
informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment, 
the job hunt and everything else is going.

3088,"Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we ""share"" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

and still give us enough time for the rehersal dinner.  But, I want to make 
sure
this fits with your schedules because we can always have it on Saturday.  On
Saturday I had planned for us to go get our nails done and hair (optional) but

Just wanted to check and see how you're doing these days.  I was offered a job with Cascade Natural Gas in Seattle this past week.  The salary is okay and the location is, of course, desirable but I'm just not completely sure about the job.  I have a while to make the decision.  They wanted an answer today, but I played hard-ball and told them I had to have more time (so silly, but it's very hard for me to do).  In the meantime, I'm exploring every contact I can come up with.  Anyways, you never got back to me and gave me any sort of idea about what your plans are post-school.

Very jealous about the Canary Island trip...that sounds wonderful.  Take my advice though...use sunscreen!  I was really good about applying everywhere except for my lower back and the back of my thighs and I've paid the price.  Kind of looks like I was scolded with boiling water.  

So I've got Lisa's wedding this weekend and my San Diego trip the next.  I'm taking Friday off this week so I can go to the Bridesmaid/House Party luncheon in San Antonio and we've got Good Friday off from work the next week so I'm looking at two four-day work weeks.  My how things have changed.

I think Katy and I are going to a corporate sponsors reception at the MFA tomorrow night and Lisa has expressed interest in going as well, but we'll see about that.  She's always enthusiastic in the beginning.  All in all things are pretty good.  

Talk to you soon,

we would eliminate the Information Sheet, the ""additional reps"" and the

3169,"A financial trade v24545 was done with Total International Limited.  This 
entity is subsidiary of a very good credit customer, TotalElf (S&P rated 
AA-).  Risk is acceptable, small volumes, short tenor, but from a legal 
standpoint, I do not think this entity is an ""Eligible Contract Party"" as we 
have no guaranty support or financial statements to support trading.  I 
noticed that quite a bit of financial trades are currently booked in London

3170,"In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. 
Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes 
Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not 
clearly categorized as ""money"" but more likely an ""account"".  Although 
certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including 
""money"", ""intangibles"", which includes ""accounts"", cannot be perfected by 
possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a 
wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes ""money"".  Although 
it is not clear, the better view is that ""money"" means cash in hand and not 
on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate 
to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken 
but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this 
seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely 
unknowingly).     

Accordingly, to perfect the ""account"" a registration is likely required at 
the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. 

Even then, as an ""account"" is an ""intangible"" certain conflicts rules for 
perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions 
provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the 
jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of 
its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration 
may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance 
search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior 
registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, 
registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and 
law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.  

Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also 
a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit 
holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.

In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my 
knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has 
recently determined that ""money"" includes deposits that we are not aware of, 
and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

Peter.

commodities into the TMS and C21 system at once. When implemented, all COMEX 
OLTE and COMEX Clearing functions and reports will be replaced by the TMS/C21 
counterpart. In addition, Average Pricing of trades will not be implemented 
in the initial rollout and deferred to a later date,

Here is the original confirmation created for the FX trade that took place on 
9/26/00. The comments provided by Merrill are as follows:

1) The want to reflect ""Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc., New 
York""(MLCSNY) rather than ""Merrill Lynch International Bank"" (MLIB).

2) They want to reference the Master Agreement dated 12/2/92 rather than 
7/1/95

3) They want to change the wire instructions to correspond with Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services, Inc., New York.

They penciled in there comments and returned the comments via fax. 

The questions are as follows:

1) Is this acceptable?

2) If so, should we just countersign on the version wherein they made their 
corrections and return to them?

3) If not, should we recreate a new confirm with the requested changes?

4) Going forward if there is a Merrill Lynch London trade, should we be using 
MLCSNY or MLIB?

We have historically only booked Interest Rate Swaps with MLCSNY until now.

Looking forward to your response.

(1)  Goldman Sachs
ENA  executed the Client Access Agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co.  on June 
15, 2000.  Since you are trading in the name of ENA, you should not need to 
execute an additional agreement.  I confirmed this with Ted Leh this 
morning.  At Ted's suggestion, please forward to me the fax number and email 
address of the Goldman person requesting that you execute further 
documentation.  I can fax to him a copy of the agreement and correspond by 
email.  I will also copy Ted Leh and Vivian Siao (keeps track of agreements 
and authorized traders) so that everyone is up to date.

(2)  UBS Warburg
I spoke with Sheryl Gallant.  ENA and other Enron affiliates are already 
trading on the UBS electronic websites for OTC transactions.  Interestingly 
enough, UBS does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by 
a customer for online trading.  In other words, ENA has an executed ISDA with 
UBS dated May 31, 1993, you are an authorized trader for ENA and UBS is happy 
to let you access their platform. Sheryl does not know why Jun Ishi requested 
execution of a ""Client User List"" (i.e., an authorized trader list) and said 
to forget it.  If you would like for me to speak to Jun Ishi or correspond 
with him (please send his email address), just let me know.

Please let me hear from you if you would like for me to pursue further.  As a

place.

We are working on the blackline.  Since the ""deal"" that you mentioned 
yesterday has no bearing on the master between ENA and FUNB, there is no 
emergency at hand.  A few things to note:  

(1)  regarding ""Procedures for entering into Transactions,""  my suggestion is 
that you consider a reasonable time period in which to respond upon receipt 
of a confirmation.  It is in both parties best interest to have an executed 
(and therefore enforceable) writing  This can be accomplished by under the NY 
General Obligations law by our agreement as to a ""deemed response"" if a party 
will not sign a trade confirmation.

(2)  regarding the concept of ""Specified Transaction"", ENA has reconsidered 
the earlier concession to exclude most Termination Events as Specified 
Conditions.  It is not ENA's position to unwind Transactions upon the 
occurrence of these events, and, therefore, each party ought to be able to 
rely upon the protections afforded it under the related provisions.  
Regarding the Credit Event Upon Merger, FUNB is protected with the amendment 
which we make to Section 5(b)(iv).

I hope that the blackline will resolve our outstanding issues.

Regarding this call tomorrow: are you going to be on this?

I gather from Jim there is a lot of worry about saying anything about how
the unit commitment process works (if it is in a centralized fashion).
That's fine, but I just wanted to get your own views on this. I wrote this
in response to the idea that we were looking for something quick and
effective to put in ASAP. The closer the parallels to working markets (e.g.
PJM) the better. That to me means following the PJM model fairly closely,
and not diverging into other tracks on the RTO process. However, I see how
people like Sue Mara are going to be very upset about this.

We can develop some other options (and they are being proposed in many of
the RTO debates around the country), but I don't want us to end up
advocating things that either won't work, are very complicated to design and
implement (e.g. the California system, with re-dispatch iterations etc.), or
just plain don't make sense. I guess the next question is how to present
this to Steve Kean.

Anyway, as tomorrow's call seems to be controversial it might be useful to
have a chat first. I should be in the office most of the afternoon, or you

3256,"Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt 
Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief
Thursday, May 31, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/31/M
N231235.DTL 
Sacramento -- Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern 
California Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at 
the expense of its biggest customers. 
The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial 
customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion 
back debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users 
would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt. 
Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but 
supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and 
should shoulder the costs it created. 
""We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these 
problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any 
problems,"" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). 
Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put 
Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help 
restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency. 
Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP 
lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt. 
The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into ""core"" and 
""noncore"" users. 
SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS
Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core 
users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would 
be those using more than 500 kilowatts. 
Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers. 
But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy. 
Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long- 
term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar 
panels, on contract with the utility. 
That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of 
the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of 
electricity. 
Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to 
buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to 
make themselves energy self-sufficient. 
The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy 
customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market. 
During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users 
would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would 
shift exclusively to the big users. 
Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be 
given what is called ""direct access"" to generators so they can negotiate 
cheaper rates. 
Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users 
because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells. 
Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so. 
EDISON 'ENCOURAGED'
Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out 
details of the plan. 
A spokesman for Edison said he was ""encouraged"" by the talks. 
""I haven't seen a finished product or a plan,"" said Bob Foster, a senior vice 
president with Edison. ""They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and 
trying to find a solution."" 
Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there 
is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity. 
""We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will 
experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years,"" said D.J. Smith, a 
lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. 
""When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another 
potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy,"" 
Smith said. 
Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and 
Technology Association: ""What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying 
the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. 
They don't want voters to pay because they vote."" 
CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 
said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business 
interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto 
residential and smaller commercial customers. 
""I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public 
Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big 
business end up costing more for residential and small businesses,"" 
Rosenfield said. 
The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of 
the transmission system that loops electricity around the state. 
Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that 
for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value. 
Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state 
purchase of transmission lines. 
In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the 
transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset. 
In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to 
either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, 
for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

on a vote of 23-11 (the bill has an urgency clause and requires 27 votes).
Senator Peace was the only Democrat to vote against the bill.  Senator Peace
spoke against the bill for five minutes during which time he, in a very
emotional state, blamed Enron for the energy crisis, claimed Enron's version
of direct access means only small customers pay for lines and other similar
charges, is trying to ruin the Japanese energy market, is running the
proceedings in Washington where it has already admitted its guilt, and is
looking for another opportunity to steal from California consumers.  Two
Republicans spoke against the bill but their comments more or less focused
on DWR's contracts.  One Republican tried to insert a hostile amendment in
the bill to establish a version of the windfall profits tax on municipal
utilities.  The amendment failed passage on a party-line vote with the
exception of a vote in support from Senator Peace.

In her close, Senator Bowen indicated that the viability of direct access
would be tied to amount of power purchased by DWR.  She characterized DWR's

I don't know if this is material for Steve's meeting, but may be of interest 
to you anyway.
Given our increasing confidence that the Arcos capacity isssue is settled, 
John Sheriff & Michael Brown indicated that they may consider another 
regulatory battle in Europe, possibly on gas, and have asked Paul Hennemeyer 
& me to draw up a list of possible complaints.  As you know, Germany is 
probably our biggest problem area, but that may not mean this is the battle 
we want to fight first.
Significantly, the European Commission is losing patience with Germany.  I 
attended the European Gas Regulatory Forum in Madrid this week (consists of 
delegates from member states gas regulators, ministries, the Commission and 
groups representing Gas Transmission Enterprises, consumer groups, offshore 
gas producers, incumbent suppliers, European Federation of Energy Traders.  
The representative from the German ministry was unbelievably outspoken about 
refusing to agree that consensus had been reached on anything, and supported 
GTE's refusal to publish any information on available capacity, transparent 
terms of access.  They also refused to recognise that the Council of European 
Energy Regulators might have any authority over Germany as they had chosen to 
go down a different route.  Political patience is clearly running out and the 
Commission is considering how they might use powers under Article 86 to 
progress either the proposed acceleratino directive or a new directive on 
information disclosure, in spite of Germany.  (Brendan says they have already 
used these powers in telecomms).

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail
By Daniel Taub 
Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray 
Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity 
market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a 
misdirected e-mail. 
The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was 
intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve 
Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press 
list, he said. 
Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would 
compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a 
state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and 
confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is 
buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt. 
``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a 
meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail 
contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. 
According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of 
electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough 
electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged 
from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the 
e-mail is accurate. 
Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a 
megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to 
Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot 
market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher 
than on the day-ahead market. 
The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a 
quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each 
season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law 
requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.

Enron Corp.
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002-7361

Dear Richard:

Thanks again for taking the time for our telephone call last Wednesday. I
thoroughly enjoyed our talk. As per your request, I've attached a copy of my
CV for your review.

What I hope and believe you will realize as you review my qualifications is
that my skills, experience, problem-solving capability and drive to succeed
uniquely position me to make an immediate and lasting positive contribution
to Enron's government relations and public affairs activities at many
levels.

Firstly, my experience within the Ontario government and the network of
contacts I've developed as a result would be of immediate value to Enron. We
both know that an intense, coordinated and targeted effort will be required
from now to beyond the next provincial election to ensure that the Ontario
market opens successfully and remains open. My unique understanding of the
key players and issues involved in the opening of the Ontario market could
be of significant value to your company through this period.

Secondly, even as local market-opening events play themselves out in
Ontario, a broader set of potential opportunities is appearing for Enron
continentally, with the Bush administration's push for a hemispheric energy
policy. The unveiling of the proposed package by the President has ignited a
continent-wide debate that will have significant impact on the shape and
substance of the policies finally adopted by governments across the
hemisphere. Clearly, it is in Enron's interest to participate in and shape
this debate, to ensure that the final policy packages enhance your economic
interests. To meet this goal, a clear set of objectives must be identified,
an effective strategy to accomplish them developed and a coordinated,
sustained campaign planned and executed. My understanding of the varied
issues and actors at play in this debate, coupled with my understanding of
how to strategically plan and manage persuasion campaigns would be of
significant value to Enron as you prepare to meet this goal on a continental
basis.

Lastly, in addition to providing value to Enron both locally and
continentally in the specific ways described above, I would appreciate most
the opportunity to provide value to your company at a truly macro level, by
helping you participate and succeed in the ongoing global debate on the
ideology of open markets, entrepreneurial activity and free trade. The
ideological conflict between advocates of the state and champions of
individual freedoms and choice can be seen at the heart of all of Enron's
challenges, be they in Ontario, India or elsewhere, and the debate - with
its' significant global implications - is far from over. History clearly
demonstrates that opening markets and freeing entrepreneurial and consumer
activity is the key to enhancing the quality of life for individuals across
the globe. By pursuing these noble goals, companies like Enron are
performing a global public good. Putting my skills to work for Enron in this
global debate would truly be my pleasure.

Once again, I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss with you my
qualifications and how I can assist Enron in achieving your government
relations and public affairs goals. Please feel free to contact me at your
convenience.

Yours truly,

On this same subject of Chairman Wood, I am told that he met with Rep. Doug Ose (energy subcommittee chairman of the Government Reform Committee) and Ose's ""energy advisory board"" on Wednesday of this week and said similar things.  He made a big deal out of a Big Mac analogy -- saying that whether you ordered one in Portland, Oregon or Portland, Maine the product is the same.  With RTOs, he supposedly said this meant if the rules are standardized, the number of RTOs becomes less important.  Those in the room, including EPSA staff, came away with the impression that Wood is backing away from only 4 RTOs based on this and other comments.  Ditto on a 12/15/01 deadline.  On the positive side, he did say that he had been consulted on the Administration's comments on the Bingaman bill and agreed that legislation without RTO language or bundled/unbundled is OK.  He understands the high risk that Congress would go the wrong way on these issues.

FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

                         (Issued November 1, 2001)          

     BROWNELL, Commissioner, concurring:

          In this order we accept Carolina Power & Light's proposal to
     makes sales of certain ancillary services at market-based rates. 
     We find that the proposal is consistent with certain conditions
     as set forth in Order No. 888 and our policy in Avista
     Corporation, 87 FERC   61,223 (1999) (Avista). 

          In Order No. 888, and subsequent cases, the Commission
     required transmission providers to offer certain ancillary
     services at cost-based rates as part of their open-access
     transmission commitment but also contemplated that third-party
     suppliers (that is, parties other than the transmission provider
     in a particular transaction) would also provide ancillary
     services.  The Commission left open the possibility that
     ancillary services could be provided at other than cost-based
     rates and stated it would entertain requests for market-based
     rates by third-parties if supported by analyses that demonstrated
     the seller lacked market-power.  In Avista the Commission set
     forth several criteria that allowed a third party to make sales
     at market-based rates, without making such a demonstration.  The
     Commission concluded that the protection of the cost-based
     backstop under the open-access tariff in conjunction with the
     criteria set forth in Avista provided an appropriate and
     effective safeguard against potential anti-competitive behavior.

          North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (NCEMC), in
     the case before us, claims that for the portion of its load on
     CP&L's system, CP&L is the only game in town because no other
     entity offers such services in the control area.  NCEMC believes
     that the rates under CP&L's market-based rate tariff may be lower
     than the open-access transmission rates and may offer a greater
     range of products and thus that it should have the opportunity to
     purchase ancillary services under CP&L's market-based rate
     tariff. 

          NCEMC's request underscores the value that an RTO can bring
     to the region.  First, access to information, standardized rules
     and procedures (including generation interconnection) and
     comparable access to the transmission grid - - all things that an
     RTO can bring or enhance - - should incent additional suppliers
     of energy and ancillary services in CP&L's control area.  Given
     the opportunity, a third party supplier will have 

                                     2

     an incentive to compete business away from the transmission
     provider, if it is profitable.  Second, control of the
     transmission system by an independent operator should mitigate,
     if not eliminate, concerns of anti-competitive behavior and








     affiliate abuse and thus produce greater options for customers -
     - ones that NCEMC appears to be seeking now.  

          CP&L did not request to sell ancillary services at market-
     based rates to customers on its own system and we do not direct
     CP&L to do so.  I believe that the order is consistent with prior
     orders and Commission policy.  I also believe, however, that
     today's order has not satisfied NCEMC's needs and has not
     advanced customer choice or flexibility, both of which I believe
     are necessary for the wholesale competitive markets to thrive and
     can be advanced through RTO formation.

3283,"The Following are our  recommended changes to the agreement( I would also 
like to discuss the waiver of conflicts section with you):

Page 2, item (3) should read ""The payment of a ""project fee"" of $175,000 upon 
the achievement of each milestone described in Exhibit A to this letter.

Item (4) should read ""The payment of a ""project fee"" equal to 2% of the 
project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in 
Exhibit B to this letter.

Exhibit A should read as follows:

Individual milestones subject to ""project fee"" payments:

1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. (""Haywood Power""), the abandonment 
by the Tennessee Valley Authority (""TVA"") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of 
its Haywood County, Tennessee facility (""Lagoon Creek""), which results in 
Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 500kV 
open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this 
milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth 
in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the 
milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said 
Interconnection Agreement.

2. With respect to Haywood Power, the decision by TVA to eliminate the 
Network Upgrade related to the reactive power requirements as set forth in 
Haywood Power's System Impact Study, presently estimated at a total cost of 
$5 million.  Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the Network 
Upgrade requirements set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA 
and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be fully achieved 
upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement to the extent such Network 
Upgrade cost is eliminated. To the extent that such Network Upgrade cost is 
less than $5 million, but greater than zero, a pro rata portion of the 
$175,000 project fee shall be paid.

3. With respect to Calvert City Power I, L.L.C. (""Calvert""), the elimination 
of TVA's present requirement for Calvert to pay for a Network Upgrade 
consisting of the construction of a new 30 mile 500kV transmission line from 
Cumberland to Montgomery. Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to 
occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion 
that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are 
viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and 
Calvert.

Exhibit B should read as follows:

The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with 
or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a ""Development 
Project""). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt 
or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively  to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30) 
days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed 
Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any 
Development Project. At such time as all definitive agreements related to the 
Development Project have been executed, the Development Project shall be 
deemed to be an approved Development Project (an ""Approved Project""). For 
purposes of payment of the project fee, the milestone shall be deemed to be 
achieved, for Approved Projects only, 50% upon the commencement of 
construction of the Approved Project, and 50% upon commencement of commercial 
operation of the Approved Project. For the avoidance of doubt, a project fee 
shall not be payable for any Development Project unless it becomes an 
Approved Project as defined herein.

3292,"Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

It's been over 2 or 3 months where we continue to experience problems with the new Market Data applet.  
The problems are ranging from the instability connection to the IFinance servers to the price update delay.

Over these past 2 to 3 months, we kept getting hammerred by our business users (traders,etc.) about these problems 
and these problems certainly reflected really bad on us as the IT support group on the trading floor.
  
Rick Le has been doing excellent supports for us.  
We are not trying to point finger to anyone in your group but we need to push these issues to Reuter's and let them know that these issues should be priority number 1 for them to fix.  It's our impression that Reuter's do not take these issues very seriously as the evidence showed that we don't have any acceptable solutions today after waiting for 2-3 months.

As we move to the new building next week, we will display the Market Data in more than 30+ plasma workstations.  The aboved mentioned problems will definitely make support very difficult.  If these problems are not fixed in the near future, we may have to seriously consider other options.  With the telerate version of the market data being more stable than the new Market Data applet, we may have to go back to use it.

Would you please help us provide better IT support to our business users.

3306,"Dear Ken: 

This note builds on the earlier voice mail, and a memorandum I have sent to  
you, following the Dave Dorman meeting. Given the initial ground work done 
by  
our team at ATT leadership level, the meeting between Jeff and David Dorman,  
we think did go as expected by us. I am sure Dave and Stewart, along with  
Jeff have shared their views of the meeting, and do feel positive about ?the  
process forward. 

Our take on the meeting is as follows: 

1. Dave Dorman is open and eager to explore ways ATT and Enron could  
cooperate across the board. 

2. Dave wants to move fast, but at a pace that will work within ATT, and is  
strategically sound for both the organizations 

3. He is now looking forward to specific value propositions from  
Enron-Adventis team, which he is prepared to discuss with us. 

4. On that basis I am sure he will guide us to the most appropriate guys  
within ATT who will need to understand and act on the value propositions. 

In view of the above the real work begins now. As discussed with Dave and  
Stewart, we will further reinforce our commitment to develop, and take the  
basic proposals with ATT forward. Our team is already on the job and will  
meet with Stewart early this week. 

I did indicate to both Dave and Stewart that we will like to take the next  
steps in a most expeditious and matured fashion so that all the strategic  
possibilities to create the new bandwidth dynamics between the two companies  
could be achieved. 

Given that there were some hesitation within Enron on the out come of the  
first meeting with ATT, we committed to the last 2.5 weeks of work with a  
reduced fee structure. Now that the first major step has been successfully  
taken, we plan to work with you along our normal professional fee schedule.  

As we do want to move as fast as possible and if at any point indications 
are  
that the desired out come will be difficult to achieve we could stop and  
review progress. As a result, although not common, we are willing to work  
with a weekly rate, adjusted to professional fees of $75,000/week and out of  
pocket expenses. In addition of course for an engagement of this nature 
which  
essentially leverages our firms professional credibility and trust in the  
industry, our clients pay us on the basis of successful execution of the  
alliance formation along preset milestones.  

Given the strategic nature of this engagement, and our commitment to assist  
you with all the major Telcos, -- incumbents and new, we will welcome to  
learn from you the basic structure of a formula which Enron is most  
comfortable with; typically in other situations in my professional life, we  
have been rewarded in three stages: 

1. On signing of ?the letter of intent(s) 
2. On ?signing of the agreement(s) 
3. On launch of the first project (s) 

Ken, while we look forward to formalizing the above, please enure we sustain  
and if not increase the momentum gained from the first summit meeting last  
Thursday. If we do the right things, the upside is indeed huge. We of course  
should also start thinking through how to build the same kind of work  
dynamics with the other Telcos, in most we do enjoy similar professional  
trust. 

We will call you tomorrow to firm up the next 3 -4 weeks of ?work --  
documentation of value propositions, actions, meetings, and decisions.

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday 
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3 days, 
I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very close 
friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given some 
politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues about 
Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year, at 
about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading 
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the 
pot. 

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly 
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the 
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also 
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan  
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves 
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will 
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently  control 
and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already been 
discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance. Obviously 
the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help GOM put the 
outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then discuss it with 
MOP on Monday. 

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be apprised  
of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This was already 
done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day 
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation 
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer - 
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under 
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing to 
move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze the 
duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the current 
$35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff from Phase 
I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently with Ministry 
of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it favorably as the 
MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to 
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the 
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if the 
current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context of 
current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has been 
scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the meantime.

3311,"Dear Jeff,

I have attached for your review the following documents related to InterFit
Health.com:

1. InterFit Health Business Plan Summary.
2. Investor list from our recent offering.
3. Investor letter concerning Sept. and Oct activities.

The current  shareholders are composed of Founders 61%, Mischer Healthcare
Services 17%, Round I investors 21%. I personally purchased 14% of Round I.
The investors purchased a convertible preferred and the company may not
incur debt without consent of the preferred holders so it is in effect a
first lien.

The company is initially focused on health screening through blood testing
but I anticipate adding other product lines such as radiology next. The
vision is to become a corporate and consumer full service diagnostic site
with medical records storage along with referral capability to healthcare
providers in major urban markets.

There are several characteristics that interested me in InterFit:

1. Empowering consumers and corporations to take controol of healthcare
management.

2. The confluence of aging baby boomer demographics and their requirements
of diagnostic testing.

3. Application of technology to enable the company's clients to access lower
pricing at their convenience vs the physicians schedule.

4. The rapid growth rate of gene based testing. Quest Diagnostics performs
six million gene based test annually with a current growth rate       of 50%
per year.

5. To date there are no direct competitors taking the integrated approach to
diagnostic services.

If you have a interest in investing we would be pleased to have you as a
shareholder. The average investment per holder in round I was $75,000. We
will have a second round closing in June 01.

Enron has used InterFit to provide health screening several times between
1995 and 1999. As we discussed my view is that corporatioons have always
approached screening as a employee benefit but never were given a integrated
solution. My approach is to provide the employee/dependants diagnostic
services, a referral solution for out of range results and storage of
historical medical records. The corporation will receive a generic data base
mapping the health of their employees which can be used to predict disease
and truly risk measure the population. Obviously this will be very useful in
negotiating managed care provider contracts on your actual data versus
getting dumped into their huge data base.

InterFit will be able to address the North American market at launch in
January 2001. The answer to your question regarding England/Europe and South
America is that we need to set up laboratory networks and provider networks
but it can be done.

In closing, I believe Enron would benefit significantly from participating
in our program but it will require senior management committment to a long
term program to reap the benefit of healthcare cost containment.

Thank you for your interest and I will look forward to hearing your
thoughts.

Sincerely,

Walt

3315,"     Hello Sukran and Mark;
     Welcome back to Turkey.
      I hope the weath weather is better in Turkey than here as it has been
cold for spring.  Temps in the 50's during the day and while we have had some
sunny days there has been plenty of rain.  I have been busy with my Golden
""K"" Club (Senior Citizen Kiwanis).  We help with a picnic for mentally
retarded children, read to needy preschool children, help at mentally
retarded track meet, go to weekly meetings and etc.  I am told May is the
busiest month and it has been but it is almost finished.
     Mother and I have been watching the weather in Italy and imagining what
the two of you are doing.  Sue is back and catching up on their business.
This week besides Foundry work they have Visited an honorary dinner for one
of Jeff's college professors.   They are also doing some major work  on their
house.   The Sweeps are over at WGN-TV for a while so now Tom is looking
forward to his trip to Alaska a week from Thursday.  Jeff is still busy with
the gas problems so we hear little from him.  I hear Peter Widman is getting
married.  Though nothing definite I hear it will be in the fall.
     Nothing else for now.  Let us hear from you.   In the meantime  WE SEND
BOTH OF YOU  LOTS of LOVE and KISSES    MOTHER and DAD",Sukran Mark Jeff Tom Peter Widman,,WGN-TV

   Would be happy to play literary critic for a day on Amazon.com.  Have
just one more chapter to go and am enjoying it very much.  Am going to
re-read it because I'm just too slow to stay with all the names and places
in the first few chapters.  I could tell later in the book that I wasn't
paying enough attention early on to remember who was famous for what.
That's just a long way of saying my mind is finally suffering the
consequences of many, many years of brain cell destruction at the hands of
thousands and thousands of little 12 oz. red and white cans.  It's another
great book and hope it is doing well for you.  I know you worked your ass
off on it and it shows.
   I'll log on for the review after I re-read it OK?

Yours in -kai-,

If what I hear is true about your retirement, let me
be one of the first to offer heartfelt
congratulations. I've never quite understood people
that basically work right up to the grave. It always
seemed to me (and now I'm finding out its true) that
there are just way too many things to do, books to
read, people to meet, places to go, etc., etc., to
work 80 hour weeks for 50 years.

When I first read about it, I thought that maybe you
and Rebecca had flipped a coin and she lost. (She had
told me that if the two of you got engaged, one of you
would have to quit.)

If you really are planning to retire, let me offer
some advice. On my odyssey I've noticed a couple of
humps I had to get over. The first one hit me at about
ten days. All of a sudden I had the stupid impression
that I should find something constructive to do. After
a couple of days, the feeling went away. However it
did come back at about the 4 week mark. Once again, I
was able to come to my senses. I think I may have
permanently suppressed the feeling at this point.

Unfortunately, now that I really do have to go back to
work, I can't seem to get too motivated. Oh well,
maybe, if nothing else, I have learned not to work 80
hour weeks ever again.

Best of luck and tell my sister hi.


Steve


P.S. I have sketched you a raised timber platform,
with a small cabin in the center (for those that think
they need indoor plumbing, etc.) If you find a place
to put it, I want to build it.

P.P.S. I just finished the first two volumes of Caro's
L.B.J. biography. Extremely interesting if you're
looking for reading mat'l.

Dear Jeff,
 
I worked at McKinsey (NY/FI) during 1985-91 and have  since founded and run an IT systems integration company called Techna in Silicon  Valley, with clients worldwide and Purnendu (""PC"") Chatterjee (ex McK and  affiliated with Soros' funds) as an equity partner. 
We have been working closely with Sempra Energy trading  for the past couple of years and are beginning an engagement with NYMEX soon.  Our president, Ben Bernstein (ex Microsoft) has been managing these clients on  the east coast personally. Ben and I feel that we have interesting ideas in IT  for Enron from our experience in this industry thus far, and would appreciate  your indulgence in getting us in touch with the appropriate IT leaders at Enron  for us to make a pitch. 
Your achievements at Enron since leaving McKinsey  have deservedly won you quite a fan following! As an unabashed member of  this group, I would love to hear from you anyway, when you find a moment in your  busy day.
Best regards.

My name is Tom Mashington and I'm a Construction Project Manager for EES in their Philadelphia office. A few weeks ago, I received in the mail a Enron newsletter which contained a feature of you and your interests. While reading the article, I noticed that you're into ""Anything Africa."" Two years ago, I was working in Ghana, West Africa on a cogen plant with Stone & Webster. Most US. citizens have no idea what the conditions are like in these 3rd world countries. 
I was curious as to how many trips you've made to the sub-Saharan section of the continent and to which countries you have visited.
Earlier, I was discussing my African experience with Marty Sunde. I sent him a few ebony wood carvings purchased from the local villagers. These pieces were hand carved by artisans in the area.  If you have a moment, you should stop by his office on the 8th floor where he has them on display.
I have also attached the files containing a few digital photo's from the area where I lived and worked. These are primarily photos from the local villages near the plant.
While you're viewing the photos, you should be able to recognize me. I'm the only American looking individual in the tribe.

Thakns again for your concern.  You're asking a lot of good questions.

The best indication my building is ok is that its standing, and that it's
contemporaires are all standing as well.  You may have read that the
buildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in the
lowlands.  Mine is neither.  Spoke to my landlord today, who is an engineer
of some sort, and for what its worth he said the building is a good one.

About shots, I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF,
though he wasn't planning for one of the worst natural disasters in our
time.  I'm keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of the
diseases they're worried about here, but am pretty sure that one cirterion
is that you have to be pretty darn close, which I'm not.

I'm not our sticking my nose into anything, though would love to see things
up close for curiosity's sake.  Trouble is, I'd just be getting in the way,
which I don't want to do.  So will, for now, restrict myself to giving a
little cash and observing what goes on here on the home front.  The damage
really is not apparent from here.  As I mentioned in my note to dad, things
are pretty darn normal.  Expect indirect impact to be visable, like
worsening inflation for example.  But that's about it.  Will keep an eye out
for trouble, though.

More later.  Thanks again for taking the time to write.  Its always nice to
hear from you.

Following the success of our three previous annual conferences on the 
e-business and technology sector, the Economist Conferences is delighted to 
announce that we are now planning our fourth annual event Creating Value with 
Internet Technologies,  to take place in London in October of this year. We 
would very much like to invite you to deliver a keynote address at this event.

Now that spending on IT and systems is once again being evaluated in terms of 
productivity gains and returns on investment, companies are refocusing their 
efforts towards cost savings and efficiencies. As companies integrate the 
Internet into their supply chains, they frequently find that they need to 
change much more than their communications technology. Their strategy, their 
approach, their deployment of skilled people, their divisional structure - 
all these things get challenged.

We would very much like to hear your perspective on the potential for the 
e-marketplace, but, at this stage, I would also be happy to hear your 
suggestions.

The project is still in the early stages but we would like to secure our key 
speakers as early as possible. I am sure your diary will be very busy but we 
feel it would be of great value to have you there. Please find attached a 
draft outline of the event, and some further information about the Economist 
Conferences.
I do hope you will be able to consider our invitation, as your participation 
would certainly help to ensure that we offer an excellent programme and 
further add value to this annual gathering. If you have any further 
questions, please do not hesitate to contact me on one of the numbers below.  
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

3345,"Tom,

I believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model, but as 
we discussed, I think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's 
cash price since the Gas Daily print is for gas traded the previous day and 
delivered the same day as the print.  If I'm trading day gas on April 7th, 
the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily 
print for April 8th.  If we do not change the model, I think we need another 
sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.  Of course, eventually 
we need to fix the model.

You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of 
our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term ""Indemnifiable Tax"".  
Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I 
think is very similar to what we were looking at before:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, ""IndemnifiableTax"" also means any Tax imposed 
by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a 
Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated, 
organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such 
jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or 
office located in such jurisdiction.

In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to 
eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's 
jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis 
for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It 
thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.

Do you think that we can or should accept this?

I spoke with Brian Cragg about the Commission's adjustment of QF prices.  He
said that to date they have only done it on a going forward basis.  They did
say when they issued their decision in March which changed the formula for
QF  pricing that they were going to continue their examination of the
formula inputs and additional future changes could be made retroactive to
March.  To date they have not taken further action.

In the past, when the Commission has made changes to rates to reflect
overcollections or undercollections, they have not gone back and
recalculated each bill. The corrections are made on a going forward basis.
Thus in the case of the PX energy charge, the energy charge on customer's
future bills would be reduced to reflect the past over payments.
Conversely, the PX credit would be reduced to reflect the fact that they
were to high in the past.

My feeling is that FERC is not going to change its RTO plans because of this possible interference from the Texas PUC

A possible scenario is SPP to ask permission to continue the implemantation of a new settlement and congestion management system. A good point for internal discussion is: To what extent  we want to oppose to those changes ? (which seem to be aligned to our recommendations, but those may imply additional SPP resources)

3395," RTO Week

Day 3 -- October 17, 2001

Standardizing RTO Tariffs

The morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in RTO tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country.  There were many diverse views on the panel, and the Staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session.  

The panelists were:  Ricky Bittle, Arkansas Electric Coop; Jim Caldwell, American Wind; Peter Esposito, Dynegy; Rory McMinn, New Mexico PSC; Glenn Ross, Dominion Resources; Audrey Zibelman, XCEL Energy.

General Observations

This panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels.  Dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges FERC to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff.  Dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by FERC, noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years.  EXCEL has it's own focus - they want to be an ITC and want to provide many of the RTO services without being an RTO.  The Wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an ""as available"" basis.   The commissioner from New Mexico does not want standardization, does not want FERC stepping on the state's jurisdictional toes, and does not want New Mexico ratepayers' rates to go up.  Arkansas Electric Coop insists that SPP transmission capacity is full, so if competitors want to move power through SPP, new transmission must first be built.

I am somewhat concerned that some of the Commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary.  While the Dynegy concept had merit at one time, it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues, and it could take many months to go through the process, only to have FERC, in the end, decide the details anyway.  We may want to submit comments on this issue to FERC at the conclusion of RTO Week.

What Services Should be Standardized?

Overall, Dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized -- timing, confirmation processing, maintenance issues, bus names, ramping protocols, assumptions for ATC calculations, posting times, bumping rules, and settlement time.  With regard to congestion management, it should not be standardized between RTOs.  

XCEL does not support a standardized tariff but urges FERC to standardize some issues such as CBM calculations, reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties.  American Wind says FERC must focus on having liquid spot markets in RTOs and not worry about tariff standardization.  Dominion cautions FERC about Dynegy's proposal to let the industry work out the details.  He says this is what happened with Order No. 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out.  

Should FERC Retain CBM?

Ricky (Arkansas Coop) believes that the bigger the RTO, the less important CBM is because the RTO will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing.  Dynegy thinks CBM should be eliminated.  Dominion thinks CBM should be retained but the rules need to be changed.  CBM should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected.  Nor should CBM be standardized because needs vary region to region.  However, because CBM is used for load, the cost of CBM should be allocated to load.  All panelists agreed with the concept that if CBM is retained, load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff.

Network Versus Point to Point Service

Peter (Dynegy) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point, similar to transportation service offered in gas -- firm and interruptible.  Peter suggests starting with the CRT tariff proposed several years ago.  Glenn (Dominion) thinks the CRT is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point.  

Should all Transmission Service Be Under the RTO's Tariff?

Most of the panelists said yes, all service should be under the tariff, but Ricky Bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years, no more than 10 years.  Commissioner McMinn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states' jurisdiction.

What Services Need to Be Changed Under a New RTO Tariff?

Jim (Wind) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize ""as available"" resources.  Ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff.  XCEL urges FERC to recognize the distinction between RTOs and ITCs and allow ITCs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs.

Ray Alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on Cost Allocation.

1.	Do we exclude bookouts (ie, only physical transactions)?

It appears that other market participants intend to exclude bookouts.  EPMI should also exclude bookouts given that these transactions never went physical and hence are not appropriate to consider in this case.

2.	Do we provide only sales transactions or do we include our purchases?

The ALJ's Order allows parties to include purchases only if the selling party is not an intervenor in this case and hence, our purchase would not be included in the data.  The ALJ wants to limit the amount of data to be provided to ease the workload.  Our initial analysis of some data from other parties is that there will be transaction data irregularities and hence, we should provide all of our relevant sales and purchases.  By having the data in the case, we can dispute any inappropriate transaction and ensure that all of our purchases are included in the calculation of refunds.  This is key for Enron in that our primary defense is that Enron deserves refunds as a purchaser to offset any sales refund amount.

3.	Do we provide data for all 4 time blocks (through 24 hours, through 7 days, through one month, through 1 year)?

The ALJ's Order indicates that parties are to provide data for transactions that are not consistent with the initial definition of ""spot"" - deals less than 24 hours done day ahead or day of.  Our initial recommendation is to provide the data but to retain our arguments that this is not consistent with FERC's Order.  The primary downside of not complying with this element of the data submission request is that we anger the ALJ and end up providing the data anyway after being told directly to comply.  In addition, it is possible that by providing all of the data we could be creating the problem that some economist or competitor could get their hands on the data at a later date and ""determine"" our trading strategies.  Weighing these risks, I would still recommend to include this data but argue before the ALJ and the FERC the ultimate relevance.

4.	Do we provide data based on contract date? 

The ALJ has requested data for contracts that were valid on December 25, 2000 that had physical energy flowing after December 25, 2000 through June 20, 2001.  This would explicitly include Balance of the Month transactions for December 2000 and the associated physical flows. To minimize the hours on these transactions, we intend to enter the transaction date in the data submission to allow for FERC staff to delete inappropriate transactions.

I will call you this morning.  

Thanks,

There does appear to be some intelligence gathering going on at the CPUC.  You should speak with legal about the inquiry.  Clearly the CPUC has a right to ask anything they want - it is my understanding is that our customers have a confidentiality clause in their contract that prohibits them from responding.

You wrote:
Enron wants a daily report of all interval data received from meters that we monitor. The data will be made available to Enron in a manner to be specified.
	If the data has been VEE'd (validated, edited, and estimated) the fields should be marked as actual or estimated - This should not be an issue on a daily basis because the data is not put through the VEE process until the end of the billing cycle when it is passed to MDMA.
	It is understood by Enron that there may be missing data in this report (i.e. missed meters, missed time periods). They do not require that they be notified of this missing data, with the understanding that all such missing data appears is an later report.
This report should include all data received by MV90 for each meter that day.

Enron asks that an initial report be generated containing the output for part of a day and sent to the Requestor for evaluation and determination of final data field need. The requestor will respond following receipt of this file with any changes in data fields required.

A second test file(s) would then be forwarded containing several days output in order to allow the Requestor to gauge daily information and volume. The requestor will respond following receipt of this second file(s) with final approval to complete the project.

I have one concern with the wording above.  It seems to confuse normal estimation requirements, which is partly designed to fill in ""missing observations"" (like a couple of hours), with data missing due to a downed phone line or no meter answer (which would be ""backfilled"" in subsequent files as you note).  Also, while we may choose to duplicate CSC's process of implementing required VEE rules, we need to understand what is required to do so.  Is it to our benefit to do so?  I have sent you separately the link to a site where you can review just what CSC is supposedly doing to comply with CAISO rules.  Would an issue arise of consistency between the VEE rules applications by CSC if different than EWS?  I never realized that VEE was applied only at the end by the MV90 system.  Are you sure?

Crosscurrents
MAUS CULTURE
by Peter Swanson
Mar 29 | ""It seems there's a movement afoot to class-up comic books -- both
adult comics, by moving them out of the ghetto of specialty stores and
sci-fi racks, and kids comics, by giving them a significant place in our
pop-culture canon. I do not doubt for a moment the artistic merits of many
of the books and writers in the comics field, adult or otherwise. What I
wonder about is this sudden bid for legitimacy. If some of these upstarts
find themselves lodged between the Styrons and the Tans on the big people
shelves, will they still talk to the superhero comics?"" From DC and Marvel
to the latest wave of serious graphic novels, the comic book has come of
age. Peter Swanson surveys the scene, and waxes just a bit nostalgic.

A. L. KENNEDY: SPASMS OF GRACE

Mar 29 | ""There's no bloodlust. And even with a very good matador and a
very good bull, the nature of the thing is that it isn't seamless and it
can't be entirely graceful. There will be spasms of grace. It's a very odd,
ramshackle thing. There are all kinds of strange pauses and clumsy bits,
and patches of costume drama, and then patches of this very odd, sometimes
beautiful communication."" A conversation with the Scottish novelist A. L.
Kennedy, whose new book, *On Bullfighting*, describes the ""death,
transcendence, immortality, joy, pain, isolation and fear"" that is the
Spanish corrida.

get a handle on Buddhism. It didn't have any of the things I considered
essential to religion, like a supernatural God, a sense of sin, authority
figures, doctrines. But the more I got into religious studies, the more I

+ THIS WEEK ...

""I joined the baboon troop during my twenty-first year. I had never planned
to become a savanna baboon when I grew up; instead, I had always assumed I
would become a mountain gorilla."" So begins Robert Sapolsky's new book, *A
Primate's Memoir,* about the time he spent in Kenya's Serengeti over the
past twenty years, researching the stress levels of a troop of baboons.
This week, we're featuring an interview with Sapolsky, a professor of
biology and neurology at Stanford. Sapolsky's interests are wide-ranging,
and our conversation with him covers everything from the shadows
colonialism still casts on Africa, to the fallacy of free will, to why he
only rates as a ""pathetically low-ranking baboon."" We've also included two
excerpts from *A Primate's Memoir,* so you can get a sense of Sapolsky's
witty and lively prose.

Best,

Katie Bacon

LOOKING FOR LEB RED
by Velisarios Kattoulas
Apr 25 | ""When I arrived at the University of London in the late 1980s, the
thing to take to parties was Leb Red--not a charming French table wine, but
a pungent, murky brown hashish from Lebanon's Beka'a Valley. Regrettably,
my fellow undergraduates majoring in Japanese were a bit square--several
have since entered finance--and by the time I fell in with the
anthropologists, Leb Red was nowhere to be found.""

ROBERT SAPOLSKY: OF MONKEYS AND MEN
by Katie Bacon
Apr 25 | ""For these baboons, stress is entirely socially generated, so they
really are good models for us. Study some marginal baboon population in
some dying ecosystem and it would not be anywhere near relevant to making
sense of which middle-aged executive gets heart disease. Our stress is
created by our privileged cocooning from ecological stressors; likewise
these baboons."" The author of *A Primate's Memoir* talks about his years as
a member of a troop of Serengeti baboons.

Derivatives I - Applied Energy Derivatives
Presented by Paradigm Strategy Group

Date:    Monday, June 4th and Tuesday, June 5th
Time:  8:00 am to 5:00 pm

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical 
understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that 
are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how 
financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management 
needs of clients.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; 
its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration 
disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines 
that are characteristic of energy prices.
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward 
curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and 
transportation.
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of 
price curves and their components.
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship 
between basis and transportation/transmission.
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, 
explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various 
customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. 
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more 
favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using 
embedded options.
Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing 
implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum 
prices, etc.

3515,"So I watched the news last night and discovered to my utter dismay that the 
whole damn city of Seattle began rioting over my pointed absence this 
weekend. Some people just don't know how to control those emotions, I guess.

How was dinner, anyway? I was actually hoping to come, but I seem to have 
misplaced Michael's phone number and so had no way of contacting you guys. 
Also, I wasn't quite confident in my ability to find your house through 
""alternative"" methods such as hanging out at the train station or wandering 
through Microsoft millionaire-type neighborhoods. And to top it all off, I 
lost my voice Friday night - for no apparent reason other than the usual 
deficit of sleep and surplus of cigarettes - and wouldn't you know it would 
have to turn into a full blown cold by this morning. 

As can be expected, we're experiencing the most insanely gorgeous weather 
I've seen in all my Februarys in Portland, which is making my acceptance of 
actually being sick even more difficult. Whatever happened with your fever? 
I'd feel much better if I knew others were sharing my pain. In fact, I 
promptly gave my cold to Amber on Saturday, so I'd have a partner in my time 
of homebound misery. She took it a step further, in true drama queen fashion. 
Case in point - I'm at work, she's rounding out her 39th consecutive hour in 
bed. 

Anyway, I'm going to skip out of here a whopping half an hour EARLY today 
because people are starting to look visibly pained when I try to talk. But I 
thought I'd check on the success of the dinner party and apologize for not 
making it. And if you get a chance, tell Michael that I have a very 
legitimate reason for losing his phone number. Or at least, I'll have one by 
the time he calls.

I do have a concern though that I wanted to ask you about. These GTC's use 
the defined term ""Commercial Term"" which is defined as follows:

""Commercial Terms"" means that part of this Agreement confirming in writing 
the specific terms of a Transaction which may be in any form adequate at law 
that is issued in connection with a Transaction.

We have taken the position in our other EOL trading that the transaction is 
complete and binding from the time we accept the counterparty's offer over 
the system by reference to the GTC, the numbers submitted by the counterparty 
(usually volume and price) and the Long Description.  We've gone to some 
lengths to make sure that the combination of GTC, website numbers and Long 
Description contain all of the necessary terms.  It's not clear to me that we 
intend the website numbers and Long Description to satisfy the definition of 
Commercial Terms.  Are these transactions not intended to be binding until 
the confirmation is signed?  Any thoughts on this?

A US Power financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under 
which the Seller 
pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by Counterparty 
on the website 
(the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the Notional Quantity per 
Determination Period.  Each 
calendar month during the term of the Transaction or the term of the 
Transaction if it is less than a month will be a Determination Period. The 
Notional 
Quantity per Determination Period shall be the volume for the relevant 
Determination Period 
(calculated using the volume submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline). The 
Payment Date(s) 
will be 5 business days after the Floating Price is determinable. The 
Floating Price shall be the 
average of the Index for each day in the relevant Determination Period.

One of the current priorities of  Casino Willamette  is our Services Desk, a 
relatively new concept whereby we supposedly do a bunch of California 
scheduling coordination services for customers who are too unsophisticated to 
deal with California complexity,  earn a reasonable little fee and, here is 
the kicker,  the whole enterprise is seen as involving ""very little risk.""  
It is seen as picking up a fair bit of change off the floor with no risk,   
as though a slot machine broke and a bunch of quarters rolled around on the 
floor and all we have to do is scrape them up.  Not big money, but safe 
money.  ""Pays the overhead,"" one often hears traders remark.  

I have drafted a series of confirms over last year to document a variety of 
transactions and am in the process of reviewing them with an eye to constant 
improvement.  I am having a series of discussions with traders, schedulers 
and settlement folks and one risk that keeps coming up in their minds, which 
I am not really sure I have covered in our documents is referred to as 
""system outage risk.""   Interaction with the Cal PX and the California ISO is 
all online electronic.  Scheduling power into the California market is all an 
online business.  So let us say that one bright spring morning we have agreed 
with our 17 SC customers to schedule a variety of power products into and out 
of the California system, and right at the critical moment when all of this 
scheduling stuff is supposed to click, the whole damn system collapses?  
Apparently we have a bunch of system apparatus that is our own,  that is, it 
is not just our link up to the California entities.  One time our  tie line 
got cut (middle of night, no problem because they got it fixed in time)  Is 
this kind of internal system breakdown an event of force majeure,  or is it a 
default on our part?  I have been reading our eol agreements, in particular, 
the ETA and am not sure how to address it.  Is it appropriate in the new age 
electronic commerce world for a party providing electronically based  
services to just tell everybody that if our system goes down we are not 
liable and by the way, if it causes a bunch of costs to come flowing back 
from the ISO,  the other poor guy has to pay them?  I would appreciate your 
thoughts, based on your eol experience.  ",Mark,,the Cal PX SC ETA ISO

     has lost another $2.50!

     Mr. Ken Lay replies
     I haven't had a chance to check our stock today, but I think for several 
reasons
     it's more volatile. But before I comment on that, our stock price is 
still up even
     if it went down that much today. It's up 40% since the beginning of the 
year
     when the Dow was down. As recently as mid-December, the stock price is up
     about 75%. That's one reason why it's so volatile. Some people bought in
     along the way, they've had a good strong increase, particularly with the
     uncertainty in the marketplace, people just want to take some money off 
the
     table. As we become more of a technology stock, a high P/E stock, a 
growth
     stock held by growth portfolios, you're going to have more volatility, 
just like all
     the other companies that fit into that category. Throughout the market,
     technology stocks quite often go up or down not just $3-$4 a whack, but 
often
     $10-$12-$15 a whack. What I tell Mark Koenig is I love that volatility 
on the
     upside, but I hate it on the down side. 

     We've had a change in the ownership of our stock. Increasingly, it's 
being
     bought by the growth portfolio managers, and increasingly it's being 
sold by
     the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower
     valuations, and now at these values they want to take their money and 
put it
     back into lower P/E stocks. I know this makes everybody a little 
nervous, but
     this is probably the world we're in now. I'd rather be in this world 
with a 50 P/E
     than the more stable world with a 20 P/E.","ENE

3560,"Sheri:

Last week you provided me with the options for a process that you and Louise 
were working on for killed deals.  The 2 options for killed deals were 1.  
the counterparty would call and execute an OTC to back out the deal (the 
opposite of whatever he transacted on line) and  2. Enron would execute to 
the counterparty a termination agreement per deal the counterparty wanted to 
back out.  My concerns for the first option are:

1.  This potentially would not create a true net effect-  timing from the EOL 
trade and the phone call to execute the OTC could have price differences

2.  The confirmation process is impacted, would have to generate 2 confirms, 
one for each side of the trade

3.  Logistics would still have to nom and schedule for delivery both deals, 
may not be even volumes 

4.  Settlements will see both invoices, again due to possible price and 
volume changes, will not be even netting 

The termination agreement would be the easiest process for the back office 
teams and would minimize the downstream effects to these processes.  The 
execution of termination agreements would be the strongest way to minimize 
our exposure to these deals since we have the Electronic Transaction 
Agreement in addition to the contract that governs the confirmation with the 
counterparty in place.   I know that commercial has a preference to option 
one but I want to make sure that all the issues are thought through with the 
possible impacts to the operations raised.  I've asked Scott Mills to explore 
Sitara for possible lock down of EOL deals after validation to ensure that 
there is tighter control over the deals for further exposure to potential 
modifications or kills.  Scott has indicated that the lock down of critical 
fields would be a big system change, but has agreed to review this and 
determine exactly what the IT estimates would be.  After we look at the 
Sitara requirements to support this change I will provide additional 
feedback.

I understand there are some concerns with regard to the amount of time 
necessary to complete the due diligence process on each new company added to

Tana has requested that we adopt some rules which would reduce the amount of 
time spent on this activity.

I am much in favour of this, but we need to ensure that the rules do not work 
such that many customers are prevented from transacting on products which 
they would otherwise be able to.

e.g. Tana has suggested that companies who are not registered in the U.S. 
should automatically receive a profile which disallows them from trading in 
U.S. physical power, as they are unlikely to hold the required FERC license 
(subject of course to review of individual requests from the companies 
themselves). I am happy with this rule, as it seems highly unlikely that 
non-U.S. companies would hold a U.S. electricity license.

them past me before implementation - assuming Mark and Justin are OK with the 
concept.

are in the process of faxing the Annex A letter which gives them until the 
end of April to respond.  With respect to the Canadian counterparties we are

It is my understanding that Mary will leave Marie Heard a voice mail about 
this today so that we can make arrangements for the letters to be sent to 
those counterparties.  Hopefully, that group will be small.

Carol
",Carol,,
3592,"Here is your conversation with my revisions marked (deletions struck through, 
insertions in bold).  Hope this helps but feel free to call or write with any 
questions or comments:

A:   The CFTC regulates futures contracts and certain kinds of option 
contracts.  
SP:  What's a futures contract?
A:  It is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of  commodity through a 
regulated  exchange.
SP:  How is the contract different than a non-futures contract?
A:  Ahem,   just for your information, we call the non-futures contracts 
forward or over the counter contracts.  The big difference is that the 
forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not.
SP:  I though the futures contracts went to delivery.  I remember getting all 
messed up on the gas side with delivery of NYMEX futures gas at the Henry 
Hub, and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans 
dumped in their front yards?
A:  Well, er,  yes they do sometimes  go to delivery, but they are not really 
supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery.  They are supposed to  
more frequently (actually the vast majority of the time) net out as financial 
transactions.  It's that option of settling financially that distinguishes 
the futures contract.
SP:  Well lets get to the point,  why are physical buy sells so bad?
A:  That's easy.  Because they look like futures contracts.  They are not 
intended to go to delivery.  And if you are trading in futures contracts you 
are supposed to be doing it on a CFTC regulated exchange. 
SP:  So what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical 
deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are 
trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the CFTC?
A:  You've got it.  But it's even worse than that - federal law says that a 
futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal: not 
only could the CFTC come after you but your counterparties could use that law 
against you to get out of performing.  So you can think of each contract like 
that as having written a free option.
SP:  Well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward 
contract?
A:  What do you mean?
SP:  Well, if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other 
29 days, would we have a futures contract?
A:  Oh for Christ's sake I've had it.   I'm telling you once and for all that 
physical buy sells are futures contracts and you can't do them now get the 
hell out of my office!--

Is this the basic idea and if so,  how much can we blend physical into it to 
cross the line into the domain of the forward contract?  --Christian 

Basically, yes.  A lot has to do with the look and feel of the thing but also 
the parties' intentions.  If we do not intend to make and take delivery, if 
we intend to settle financially - or even intend to just have the option to 
settle financially, we have a problem.  The closest thing we have to an 
exception to this is the provision for cover damages when one party fails to 
deliver.  That is a provision in the contract that might be argued gives one 
party the right to settle financially just by failing to perform.  We argue 
that this is still a forward and not a future because the parties in good 
faith intend initially that delivery will be made and a default occurs when 
there is a failure to make or take delivery.  Unfortunately, in the power 
world a large percentage of contracts may in fact get booked out.  However, 
each party enters into those contracts knowing that they have an obligation 
to make or take delivery and the book-outs may or may not happen - we do not 
enter into those contracts knowing that they will be booked out.  The 
book-outs occur after the fact by mutual agreement at the time of the 
book-out.  In fact, if we didn't want to book them out, we could stand on our 
legal rights and require all of our counterparties to make and take delivery 
(although I assume this might not go over well with many of them or with our 
scheduling desk if a book-out would be more convenient at the time).",,,CFTC NYMEX

Yes, we should be ready to go, although the law firm we are using in Japan 
(Baker & McKenzie in Tokyo) have indicated that they still have a few open 
issues to follow-up on.

Baker & McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron non-Tokyo trading office 
receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty, that payment 
should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax.  Further, 
they have advised that consumption tax (Japan's 5% VAT) should not apply to 
financial transactions, although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical 
product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the 5% consumption tax. 

Baker & McKenzie have advised that they need to do some follow-up work with 
respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some 
further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where 
our non-Japan trading offices are located.  I expect to have their response 
shortly.

One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of 
the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other 
Enron trading offices.  In this case, it may be appropriate for Enron Japan 
to receive a service fee for such services.  I am in the process of 
determining to what extent Enron Japan would be providing services.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional 
information.  I will let you know of any additional developments as soon as 
they occur.

_____________________________________________

I think that the ""general policies"" route is the right (and only) one - 
particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged.  From a 
legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all 
clear, provided
in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty 
of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc).  
We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not 
per se a legal task)
in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location
in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location

Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in 
the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as 
generically as possible.

3624,"As we discussed, the following summarizes my understanding of the issues you 
would like us to analyze and address in a memo (recognizing that some of 
these issues cannot be definitively resolved at this point):

1.  After 10/1/00 -- Can Enron dispense with confirms completely, regardless 
of whether there is a master agreement in place with the counterparty, and 
instead advise counterparties of executed transactions through some type of 
notice (or perhaps just through a daily transaction summary) delivered 
through EOL?  If so, what (if anything) needs to be done to make this 
procedure effective (e.g., amendments to electronic trading agreement)?

2.  Before 10/1 -- Can Enron dispense with confirms if the applicable master 
agreement permits, or if there is no master, and provide notices through EOL 
in the manner described above?  What are the risks of relying on clicks 
evidencing a counterparty's transactions prior to the effectiveness of the 
legislation?

3.  When dealing with a non-US counterparty, what (in general terms) is the 
risk of following the procedures described above and not sending confirms?  
In other words, if the counterparty is in a jurisdiction that does not 
recognize electronic signatures as binding, is there a meaningful risk that 
the counterparty will be able to avoid transactions (recognizing that this 
question cannot be answered definitively without advice from local counsel 
and that we will only be able to provide general observations)?  How does the 
analysis change if the counterparty has signed a master agreement governed by 
NY law?

4.  Are confirms required for physical transactions, pursuant to Article 2 of 
the UCC?  If so, must they meet any specific requirements?

5.  Miscellaneous other issues -- Can tapes of phone trades suffice as 
electronic signatures under the federal legislation?  Is it sufficient for 
one party to have the ability to store and retrieve records of the 
transaction if the other party does not?

Please let me know if your understanding of the questions to be addressed 
differs from the foregoing.  Thanks.

As I mentioned one of our hedgefund counterparties has suggested the=20

""(ii) it is not any employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retiremen=

The following paragraphs are two explanations on why they want this change.

...we have counsel tracking down the cite, but I think your expert is
mixing two different issues.  We are not obliged to get exception from a
""prohibited transaction"" because we are NOT an employee benefit plan.  If
more than 25% of your assets are employee benefit assets you are deemed to
be a plan - which is why we have a limitation up to that amount.  It is
clearly our intention to not be considered a employee benefit plan fiduciar=
y
and the 25% test is one of the criteria for this.

The cite is 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, which is a Department of Labor
regulation generally referred to as the ""plan asset regulation"".  The plan

",,,
3671,"In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it in
detail.

1.  The Issue

The essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May 12,
i.e. the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claim
that the transaction is not binding because:

(a) it was outside the company's business purposes, or
(b) execution of the application was not authorized.

This issue is not unique to Japan

There is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the trading
of any of the products through the internet, including issues as to 
contractual
enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet, on which we advised
on 15 March.  A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email.

Neither is there any question, if the above issue is resolved, of the 
Electronic
Trading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the 
contract.
(We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect.)

2.  Enron's Practice re EOL

Our understanding is that:

* Potential customers have been sent the password application under cover
of a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application.  
Neither
the letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form.

* Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a credit
standpoint but also, we understand from Mark Taylor, to quickly confirm the
authority of the signer (by e.g. in the case of a U.S. counterparty, checking 
if
the signatory shows the title ""director"" alongside his name).

* If satisfied, Enron then signs the acceptance part of the application
and issues a password.

* Four applications had been received regarding Japan as of 11am today and
none has yet been approved.

3.  Business Purposes

Article 43 of the Civil Code provides that a juristic person has rights and
obligations in accordance with law and the business purposes specified in its
constituent documents.  Where a corporation enters into a contract outside its
business purposes, the contract is prima facie void.

However, if the counterparty did not know that the contract was beyond the 
power
of the corporation, and was not negligent in failing to know such fact, the
contract will be enforced under Article 110 of the Civil Code.

The most prudent practice would be for Enron to obtain a copy of the
counterparty's business purposes (certified by the Legal Affairs Bureau or by 
a
representative director) and form a view on whether the proposed transaction
falls within those purposes.

However, since Japanese companies' business purposes, after listing a limited
number of specific purposes, generally include a final item along the lines of
""all incidental or ancillary business"", it is common for companies to not make
this inquiry except in the most major contracts.

With respect to statutory corporations, however, care is required because 
often
their business purposes are in fact limited.

Accordingly, a rule of thumb solution would be: if the counterparty name does
not contain ""Kabushiki Kaisha"" or ""Yugen Gaisha"" at the end of the name, to 
make
further inquiries.

4.  Authority to Bind the Company - The Law

The position in Japan is similar to that in a number of other countries in the
sense that:

(a)  Deemed Authority

The law provides for a form of execution which, if followed, entitles a party 
to
presume that the company is bound.  In Japan, this involves the execution of a
contract by the company's ""representative director"".  This corresponds to the
presumption concerning the affixing of the company seal in some states of the 
US
and in the UK, and the execution of the contract by 2 directors in Australia.

It is possible for the powers of the representative director to be restricted 
by
law or the constituent documents of the corporation. (Article 53 of the Civil
Code) but if the counterparty did not know of such restriction, the contract 
is
still binding on the company.

(b)  Apparent Authority

In common, with other countries, Japan has a concept of apparent authority.
Article 262 of the Commercial Code provides:

 ""A company shall be liable to a bona fide third party for any act done
by a director invested with any title such as president, vice president,
executive director or managing director from which it may be assumed that he 
has
authority to represent the company, even in cases where the person has no 
power
of representation.""

Articles 37 and 38 of the Commercial Code extend the same concept to ""general
managers"" (so shihainin).  It is generally considered that Article 43 then
applies the concept to ""an employee who has been entrusted with certain types 
of
matters or specific matters.""

Accordingly, in addition to persons having the titles listed in Article 262
(above), the general view is that persons having titles such as general 
manager
and division manager (bucho), will be deemed to have the authority to 
represent
the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the 
company's
business for which they are responsible.

It is also likely that section managers (kacho) or section chiefs (kakaricho)
have power to bind the company to a certain extent in areas for which they are
responsible.

(e)  Holding Out

Even if an employee of the company is acting outside his actual authority, if
the company has held the employee out as having authority, the company will be
bound by his/her action.

5.  Practical Considerations

In formulating an approach for Enron to take on the basis of the above law, 
the
following factors are relevant:

(a)  Practice regarding Representative Director Seal

It is common for a counterparty to seek to take the advantage of the 
presumption
referred to in 4(a) above by requiring the representative director's corporate
seal to be affixed (and, if contract is in English, for him to sign) or  to
insist on tracing the ""chain of authority"" of the signatory up to the
representative director (e.g. by power of attorney), for major or unusual
transactions.

(b)  Size of Transaction

The question is what transactions fall into the ""major"" or ""unusual"" category.

Unfortunately the cases on this do not allow a clear line to be drawn.  As in
many other countries, the answer depends on factors such as those noted in 
(c),
(d) and (e) below, which vary company by company.

Accordingly, where the contract involves (or could involve) a considerable
ongoing exposure by the company, Japanese corporations would not be surprised 
to
be asked for the signatory to be at a certain level, or for written 
confirmation
of the signatory's authority to be obtained from a person at such level.

(c)  Size of Company

While it would be prudent and normal to insist upon the representative
director's seal being affixed to a contract of the present type in the case 
of a
smaller company, it would not be normal practice to so insist in the case of a
major company such as a bank or major trading company counterparty, in which
companies lower level employees are presumed to have greater authority.

(d)  Business Department of Signatory

The counterparty is more likely to be bound under the apparent authority
doctrine if the signatory is in (and carries a title which refers to) the
relevant business department (e.g. energy), than if he is not.

(e)  Degree of Exposure

To the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to 
expose
the counterparty to considerable liability, the possibility of a counterparty 
in
the future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant a
reasonably conservative approach.

(f)  Recent History

However, even when faced with considerable losses during the recent economic
crisis, Japanese companies (at least major companies) have not generally
attempted to use lack of authority as a defense, presumably because of
reputation considerations.

(g) Identity of Addressee

The title of the person to whom the invitation letter is sent may be relevant.
For example, if it was sent to the General Manager of the relevant department,
but the application came from a section chief, there would be strong argument
that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary
authority.

(h)  Internal Procedures

Since the law concerning execution by a representative director can be
considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in
some countries, and by two directors in for example Australia, the Japanese
rules are not out of line with those of other countries.

Accordingly, it should be necessary for Enron to take a more stringent 
approach
to Japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in other
countries.  The procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient for
Japan as well, although some adjustment will need to be made for Japan's 
unique
regime of company titles.

6.  Conservative Approach

If the online transactions are treated as a major or unusual transaction for 
the
counter-party, under common practice Enron would require:

* The application to be executed under the registered seal of (and counter
signed by) a representative director, or by a person who is able to produce
documentation showing a line of authority originating with a representative
director.

* A certified copy of the seal register.

* A certified copy of the register of the company issued by the Legal
Affairs Bureau, to confirm the business purposes and the identity of the
representative director.

7.  Less Conservative Approach

Major Companies

For major Japanese trading companies, banks, insurance companies and other
companies of equivalent size, the following approach could be adopted which
would not be out of line with market practice:

* The application to be executed by a manager (or general manager)(bucho)
of the relevant department or above, or

* By a person able to establish a line of authority from such party.

A more aggressive approach would involve accepting applications signed by a
person at the level of section manager (kacho) or section chief (kakaricho), 
but
this is right ""on the line"" and we would prefer Enron to do so only if there 
is
some history of dealings with the company or other evidence to back up an
apparent authority argument.

Smaller Companies

For other companies the approach would be as set out in 6. above.

Perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark for
dividing between small and large companies.

8.  Likely Response of Target  Companies

Your marketing experts will be in a better position than us to form a view 
but,
taking into account Japanese commercial practice, we do not believe any 
company
is likely to be offended if Enron responds along the above lines to an
application signed by a person who does not meet the above suggested approach,
particularly taking into account that the approach is not inconsistent with 
the
correspondence and application form the companies have been sent and no
applications have yet been approved.

Thanks for the quick turnaround.

I have only a few comments to the draft request for advice to Kim & Chang:

1) I think you should clarify that the servers for EOL are located and 
maintained outside Korea.

2) I think you should mention that in other jurisdictions we have reviewed 
(e.g., US, Australia) for the legality of weather derivatives, counsel has 
advised us that the instruments are not likely to be treated as insurance 
contracts.  This is primarily because the payout is not linked to a casualty 
event as would be the case in an insurance contract.  David Minns may have 
additional language to add here.

3) Under Weather Derivatives, delete ""Osaka"" and replace with ""Australia"".

4) Just a point of clarification, but as currently envisioned by the Korean 
commercial team (e.g., Chris Hunt, Jae-Moo and Michelle Lee) when we met with 
them here in Houston earlier this week, financial derivatives (e.g., interest 
rate, f/x) would not be traded online with Korean counterparties. Basically, 
any financial derivatives that would be traded would involve personnel likely 
located in Japan entering into via phone (e.g., conventional means) an 
interest rate hedge or f/x hedge with a Korean financial counterparty in 
order to facilitate the management of the risks carried in Enron Corp.'s 
global financial risk book in Houston. This would just be an extension of the 
services that would be performed by Enron Japan on behalf of Enron. 
Accordingly, I think we need to delete the ""On-Line Financial Derivatives"" 
portion of the draft request b/c I think the analysis captured in the earlier 
memos from Kim & Chang generally addresses this type of derivative activity. 
If you think otherwise, please adjust the request appropriately.  

4) As to ECTRIC's GTCs, I think you should just attach the collateral version 
for now. 

Susan : Do you have any comments to add to the request for advice from a tax 
perspective?

I have also copied David Minns on this note to keep him apprised of this 
request b/c of the Weather Derivatives piece.

Matt, assuming you receive no further comments internally, I think you should 
go ahead and finalize the request and e-mail to Kim & Chang for their review 
by the end of this week.

transactions done through EnronOnline, bearing in mind that it will be Enron

05/12/2000
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Mutual-fund giant Vanguard Group is seeking regulatory 
permission to offfer a new type
of share class for five of its nine stock-index funds that would act like 
exchange-traded funds. 

Vanguard, which has thrived for years by offering low-cost stock funds, said 
the share class, called ""Viper"" shares
for Vanguard Index Participation Equity Receipts, will be listed on the 
American Stock Exchange. The funds which
filed to register a Viper class of exchange-traded shares are Vanguard 500 
Index Fund, Vanguard Growth Index
Fund, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Vanguard Value Index Fund and 
Vanguard Small-Cap Index
Fund.

Index mutual funds, traditionally the lowest cost provider of mutual fund 
portfolios, are being challenged by
exchange-traded funds, which are mutual-fund-like vehicles that trade over an 
exchange like a stock.
Exchange-traded funds cost less than index funds because the asset-management 
firms that sponsor them don't
deal directly with the individual investor through expensive telephone 
centers and retail offices. 

The Viper shares differ from conventional mutual fund shares in that they 
trade continuously at market prices on the
American Stock Exchange rather than the calculated net asset value of the 
fund determined at the end of the
trading day. Given this flexibility, Vipers shares are expected to appeal 
primarily to short-term investors. Vanguard
has yet to determine the expense ratios for the Viper shares. 

The move by Vanguard, the second largest mutual fund company, comes amid 
heightened competition in the
marketplace for index investors. Barclays Global Investors, a huge presence 
in the pension-investing world. is
preparing over the next four weeks to unveil 28 new index funds that will 
also trade on the American Stock
Exchange. The exchange-traded funds will track everything from the total U.S. 
stock market to industrial and
Internet sectors. 

The flagship Barclays product, iShares S&P 500 Fund, will mirror the 
big-company Standard & Poor's 500-stock
Index and will have an annual expense ratio of 0.08% to 0.10% of assets, 
people familiar with the situation told The
Wall Street Journal. That's about half the price currently paid by investors 
in the $105 billion Vanguard 500 Index
Fund.

Daily Update -- McGraw-Hill Sues Vanguard Over Planned Vipers Funds

06/08/2000
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Interactive
Financial Services Update
For June 8, 2000
Today's top stories as of 4 p.m. EDT:

- McGraw-Hill Cos., on behalf of its Standard & Poor's Corp. unit, has filed 
a lawsuit in federal court charging the
Vanguard Group Inc. with breach of contract and trademark infringement in 
connection with the mutual fund
company's proposed new Vipers exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. 

McGraw-Hill's suit alleges Vanguard breached the companies' 1988 license 
agreement by using Standard & Poor's
proprietary indices and trademarks for the Vipers exchange-traded products 
without permission. 

Officials from Vanguard, the nation's second largest fund firm, weren't 
immediately available to comment on the
lawsuit. 

Exchange-traded funds are a hybrid version of index mutual funds that can be 
bought or sold during the day at
market prices instead of at the once-daily 4 p.m. price used by traditional 
mutual funds. ETFs are single shares of
stock that replicate an index such as the Standard & Poor's 500. 

Standard & Poor's currently has more than 400 license agreements for uses of 
its indices and trademarks, including
agreements related to ETFs, according to McGraw-Hill. 

McGraw-Hill wants to prevent Vanguard from using S&P's indices and trademarks 
in connection with Vipers or any
other exchange-traded security. The complaint also seeks an order requiring 
Vanguard to withdraw its Securities
and Exchange Commission application for Vipers, and seeks an order declaring 
Vanguard liable for unspecified
damages and attorneys' fees. 

- Liberty Financial Cos. confirmed it is in talks to acquire Wanger Asset 
Management L.P., which operates the
Acorn mutual funds. 

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Liberty (L), a Boston-based 
asset-management company, would pay
about $450 million for Wanger, a Chicago investment company that has been on 
the SELLING block for several
months. 

The Journal said the reported price of the transaction, which equals about 6% 
of Wanger's $7.3 billion of assets
under management, would be considered a healthy one for a mutual-fund company 
and follows a recent trend of
well-priced deals. Pioneer Investment Management was bought last month for 
$1.2 billion, about 5% of assets, even
as the firm's management was being sharply criticized by shareholders and its 
funds were suffering big withdrawals.

The typical price for a fund firm had been about 3% of assets, depending on 
how the assets were invested. Wanger
was considered attractive because most of its assets are in highly profitable 
stock mutual funds. 

Liberty, majority owned by Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., has about $67 
billion in assets and 95 mutual funds. 

- Midwest bank National City Corp. will sell about $2 billion in student 
loans as part of a restructuring of its balance
sheet. The company said the sale, expected to close in the second quarter, 
will result in a pretax gain of about $75
million. 

In addition to the student loan sale, National City is also evaluating other 
alternatives. Some would require the
recognition of losses, given current market conditions. 

Cleveland-based National City (NCC) reported a decline in first quarter net 
income as borrowing costs rose more
than loan rates. Last November the bank warned analysts to reduce profit 
estimates as the spread between its
borrowing costs and lending rates shrank. The problem for National City and 
many banks is the failure of deposit
growth to keep pace with loan demand. That forces them to fund loans with 
money borrowed at higher rates in the
capital markets. 

National City expects its balance sheet reorganization to be complete by the 
end of the third quarter. 

- Led by a fall in the typical interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, 
rates declined in a weekly survey from
Freddie Mac. 

The mortgage buyer (FRE) said the average rate lenders were seeking on a 
fixed, 30-year mortgage fell to 8.32% for
the week that ends Friday. That is down from 8.54% last week. 

The average rate for a fixed, 15-year mortgage was 8.04%, down from 8.24%. 
The rate for one-year, adjustable rate
mortgages, or ARMs, slipped to 7.24% from last week's 7.25%, which was the 
highest since April of 1991. 

The Freddie Mac survey appears to confirm that mortgage rates, which rose to 
their highest level in five years in
May, may have eased a bit. 

HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J. financial publisher, said the average rate for 
a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to
8.4%, down from a high of 8.79% for the week ended May 19. 

""I wouldn't call it a rally, but we are getting some relief,"" Keith 
Gumbinger, an analyst at HSH told The Wall Street
Journal. 

Recent economic data - including a Labor Department report last week showing 
a rise in the unemployment rate -
suggest the economy is cooling. That has calmed fears about inflation, 
sending interest rates for Treasury bonds
and mortgage-backed securities - which mortgages follow - lower.

On June 1, 2000, the Treasury Department expanded its list of Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons under the Narcotics Trafficking 
Sanctions Regulations by adding a large number of Colombian entities and 
individuals designated as ""SDNTKs"" (Specially Designated Narcotics 
Traffickers under the Kingpin Act).  The Kingpin Act blocks all property and 
interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by 
significant foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by President Clinton. 

The targets of this measure are major narcotics traffickers and trafficking 
organizations based in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, the Dominican 
Republic, Laos, Mexico, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, Peru, 
Russia, and Thailand.

U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transaction or dealing in 
property or interests in property of SDNTKs and from engaging in any 
transaction that evades or avoids the prohibition of the Kingpin Act.  These 
prohibitions affect trade transactions as well as accounts, securities, and 
other assets.

Reflecting the concern of many in Congress that current civil penalties 
related to the export control and economic sanctions violations (normally, 
$10,000 to $11,000) do not sufficiently deter prohibited conduct, the Act 
authorizes civil penalties of up to $1,000,000.

3699,"Given the proliferation of new products and the potential of Enron Net Works 
to continue this trend, I am soliciting guidance as to the proper 
administration of the Risk Management Policy regarding employee trading.  

The following is the verbatim language from the Policy:

""Section VII.  Miscellaneous 
   Employee Trading.  No employee may engage in the trading of any Position 
for the benefit of any party other than an Enron Company (whether for theri 
own account of thr the account of any third party) where such Position 
relates to (i) any financial instrument, security, financial asset or 
liability whch falls within  such employee's responsibility at an Enron 
Compay or (ii) any other commodity included in any Commodity Group.""

Administration of this policy has been limited to the efforts of Mark Taylor 
and Tana Jones in the Legal Department primarily consisting of employees 
""confessing"" to trading certain products.    In the past, if the product has 
been one that Enron does not trade, the employee is told that it is ok.  If 
it is a product that we do trade, then they are informed to comply with 
policy.    Restrictions on the trading of financial instruments, such as 
equities, interest rates and foriegn exchange have been limited to those that 
are currently managing those books for an Enron Company or those who might 
have access to information that was not in the public domain.

Generally, we have found that people have traded yen, S&P futures, metals and 
agricultural products.   Now that we have authorized the trading of a wide 
variety of agricultural products and metals, we may need to advise employees 
not to trade them (immediately, soon, never???).   We may also consider 
changing the policy or altering our enforcement methods.

Summary of issues discussed: 

1. Whether Weather Derivatives will be classified as a Commodity Derivative 
or a Financial Derivative, since Korea has no experience with such a product. 

2. Commodity Derivatives are defined in the FETR but does not seem to capture 
Weather Derivatives as reference is made to products that can be delivered or 
received. Financial Derivatives are not defined.

3. Commodity Derivatives require a prior reporting the the Bank of Korea for 
each trade. Financial Derivatives require prior approval from the Bank of 
Korea for each trade. Failure to make report or obtain approval means the 
Counterparty would not be able to remit funds to make payment. 

4. Bank of Korea has informally advised K&C that, for Commodity Derivatives, 
the report can be made by the foreign counterparty (ie. Enron) and, 
notwithstanding it ought to be a prior report,  can be done as soon as 
possible after the trade confirmation. However, Bank of Korea has the 
discretion to reject any report made. This would make a trade effectively 
unperformable or unenforceable.

5. Bank of Korea took on the role to receive such reports in April 1999 and 
informally informed K&C that they have yet to receive a single report. Prior 
to April 1999, reports were made to certain designated banks.

6. K&C advised that if the report is made by a Korean counterparty, it would 
have to declare why it is entering into the transaction and the risk it is 
hedging, but this requirement would not be applicable if the foreign 
copunterparty makes the report. I am of the opinion that this statement 
should be viewed with caution, especially since there is really no expereince 
in Korea of such reports being filed with the Bank of Korea.

7. For Financial Derivatives, prior approval is required before a trade is 
done and may take 3 to 5 days.

8. The reporting and approval requirements apply only to onshore Korean 
entities.

9. In order to determine how Weather Derivatives would be classified, K&C 
recommends approaching the Bank of Korea to make a detailed presentation. The 
Ministry of Finance and Economy (which is the legislative authority) may have 
to be approached if Bank of Korea is unable/unwilling to make a decision. 
Such lobbying is likely to be protracted. I have asked K&C to make informal 
enquiries as to whether Bank of Korea would likely classify Weather 
Derivatives as Commodity Derivatives or Financial Derivatives, and whether it 
would be receptive to presentation on Weather Derivatives.

10. K&C also advised that it would be preferred if the overtures to Bank of 
Korea can be made by Korean companies with a real interest in doing Weather 
Derivatives. K&C was of the view that Bank of Korea is conservative and may 
view Enron with some suspicion as a foreign company ""out to make lots of 
money"".

11. Mike Dahlke also brought up the issue of Business Model Patent in Japan 
which he had spoken with John V. about. John - could you fill me in, in case 
applicable to Korea?

It seems to me the main obstacle is the issue of reporting to/approval from 
Bank of Korea.  The reporting requirement applies to Liquid Fuel Derivatives, 
and the approval requirement would apply to the Financial Derivatives 
potentially offered out of Enron Japan. The Korean regulations do not seem to 
accomodate prompt telephone derivative trading, let alone instantaneous 
online derivative trading.

Please advise next steps, in particular, do the commercial guys want to 
proceed with approaching Bank of Korea and how would it be coordinated.

Meanwhile, I attach my comments and queries of K&C's memorandum for your 
review. Please let me know as soon as possible if you have other comments for 
me to revert to K&C.

3704,"Thanks for sending the chart.  I will send you the list of questions we 
discussed tomorrow.  In the interim, I had a couple of questions on the 
chart:  On the first line (physical, no master), is the basis for not 
requriing the confirm to be signed the UCC?  Also, what is meant by ""unless 
commodity not 'good'""?

Thanks.

3705,"David:

Yes, the UCC (Article 2) would be the basis for not requiring a signed 
confirmation from the counterparty receiving the confirmation if the physical 
product is a ""good"" under the UCC. This I think answers your second question 
also.

",,
3706,"As we discussed, the following summarizes my understanding of the issues you 
would like us to analyze and address in a memo (recognizing that some of 
these issues cannot be definitively resolved at this point):

1.  After 10/1/00 -- Can Enron dispense with confirms completely, regardless 
of whether there is a master agreement in place with the counterparty, and 
instead advise counterparties of executed transactions through some type of 
notice (or perhaps just through a daily transaction summary) delivered 
through EOL?  If so, what (if anything) needs to be done to make this 
procedure effective (e.g., amendments to electronic trading agreement)?

2.  Before 10/1 -- Can Enron dispense with confirms if the applicable master 
agreement permits, or if there is no master, and provide notices through EOL 
in the manner described above?  What are the risks of relying on clicks 
evidencing a counterparty's transactions prior to the effectiveness of the 
legislation?

3.  When dealing with a non-US counterparty, what (in general terms) is the 
risk of following the procedures described above and not sending confirms?  
In other words, if the counterparty is in a jurisdiction that does not 
recognize electronic signatures as binding, is there a meaningful risk that 
the counterparty will be able to avoid transactions (recognizing that this 
question cannot be answered definitively without advice from local counsel 
and that we will only be able to provide general observations)?  How does the 
analysis change if the counterparty has signed a master agreement governed by 
NY law?

4.  Are confirms required for physical transactions, pursuant to Article 2 of 
the UCC?  If so, must they meet any specific requirements?

5.  Miscellaneous other issues -- Can tapes of phone trades suffice as 
electronic signatures under the federal legislation?  Is it sufficient for 
one party to have the ability to store and retrieve records of the 
transaction if the other party does not?

Please let me know if your understanding of the questions to be addressed 
differs from the foregoing.  Thanks.

 Supper on Thursday sounds great.   We can plan to eat right after
your meetings end.  I will get tickets for the play Thursday night if you
are interested (I still go to all the plays - If you're not interested, I'll
just go on Sunday).  I'm looking forward to getting together again (I can
show you our new NMR).
 If I can do a little campaigning - don't repeat what I say here, I
don't want to get in any trouble.  I'm enclosing the brief notes from a
science building meeting last fall about the campaign.  We hope the campaign
isn't just about bricks and mortar.  It would be a great opportunity to
strengthen the sciences.  #'s 1, 2 and 3 below were particularly important
to many people.  #1 is getting scholarship money to attract good students
into the sciences.  #2 is endowment for equipment (we have a growing
endowment in chemistry and biology - I'll tell you about it when you are
here).  It is just that science has become very expensive and we would like
for this endowment to grow.  #3 is just to look at remodeling the science
building - chemistry doesn't need this as much as biology and psychology.  I
don't want you to push for these particular things - they would know you had
been lobbied!!  It is just that I hope there will be some attempt to
strengthen academics in the campaign - I'm also aware that some of our
requests may not be the most fundable items.  It is always easier to raise
big money on bricks and mortar.

3726,"I have been reviewing procedures that would need to be put in place to cover 
counterparties from other jurisdictions trading Australian power. There is 
one related contractual issue I have not been able resolve. As it is not an 
issue at peculiar to Australia I would appreciate your input. My apologies in 
advance if I am covering well trodden ground. 

It is settled that a counterparty will enter into one Password Agreement and 
one ETA. There will be a principal Enron contracting party for the PA and 
ETA, which I will refer to as the  ""Enron Principal"" . However the definition 
of ""Enron""in both documents also includes other Enron affiliates. In this way 
the Enron Principal enters into the PA and the ETA as an agent for any 
affiliate that may at some stage enter into an EnronOnline Transaction with 
that counterparty. This means the relevant Enron affiliate could enforce the 
terms of the PA and ETA . This is in addition to the rights of the Enron 
Principal to enforce the ETA and PA. But what happens if the Enron affiliate 
is not in existence (i.e. has not been incorporated)  at the time the PA is 
signed and the ETA is  accepted by the counterparty? It is settled law in 
Australia and I believe in England that you cannot be a party to a contract 
if you don't exist.  

What does this mean? Well in most instances not much. If it was a question  
of enforcement of the contractual terms of the ETA or the PA the Enron 
Principal could seek the relevant remedy such as an injunction or specific 
performance. But procedural problems in litigation could arise if a newly 
incorporated Enron company suffered damage through a breach by a counterparty 
of the ETA. For example a breach of the indemnity in clause 4. The Enron 
Principal could not sue for damages as it would have suffered none. 

Whilst not a major issue it may be prudent to ensure EnronOnline procedures 
recognise the particular circumstances that arise when introducing a newly 
incorporated Enron entities as contracting parties through EnronOnline.  ","Enron""in",,Password Agreement ETA Enron PA EnronOnline

3735,"Attached are revised Order Forms based on comments I received today from Lynne
Carithers.

Accepted changes to the Order Forms are as follows:

1.  The portals enroncredit.com and enrondirectfinance.com have been added to
the Order Forms.

2.  Under Reuters Services for Reuters Global Focus News Gallery, language 
which
states that new reports will be made available as new countries are added to 
the
Reuters Domestic News Pool has been added.

3.  In the Fee Schedule for both Order Forms, reporting has been changed from 
5
business days to 10 days.

Changes that were not accepted:

1.  Proposal to change Enron Corporation to Enron Corporation & Affiliates.  
The
reason for this is that Reuters needs to look to one entity for all fees,
reporting, and enforcement for the agreement.  The fact that Enron's 
affiliates
will contribute content to a site or that the users of the sites are customers
of Enron's affiliates poses no problem under the agreement, but the agreement
makes clear that the Reuters news/data will be delivered to only one entity
(Enron Corporation) and that Enron Corporation will be the entity that
republishes the content on the URLs.

2. Proposal to change ""wholly -owned and controlled"" to 30% ownership 
interest.
I have added language to reflect that subsidiaries can include ""over 50%
ownership interest"" instead of ""wholly-owned"" but that is as far as we can go 
on
this provision.  The reason for this is that we need to ensure that Enron
exercises effective control over the URL.

I understand Enron had a question on the Per User Royalty for the News Order
Form regarding the ""90,000 accesses"".  The $1 million in base fees covers 4500
users.  The 90,000 accesses is based on 4500 users each accessing every 
business
day of the month (approx. 20 days).

I will contact Mark Taylor regarding other legal issues on the Terms &
Conditions.

References to ""Distributor's Subsidiaries"" have been added in the license 
grant
in Section 4.1 of the T&C as well as in the indemnification section in Section
14 to extend the indemnification protection by Reuters to Distributor's
Subsidiaries.  Because of the wider scope of the license, a Section 16.10 has
been added to make clear that if any of Distributor's Subdiairies breach the
Agreement, Reuters will look to Enron Corp. rather than the individual
subsidiary.  The reason for this is that although Reuters acknowledges that
Enron's subsidiaries may be involved in operating the URLs, Reuters does not
want to be put in a situation in which it has to search for the relevant
subsidiary to remedy the breach.

but have extended the deadline until this Thursday, April 27.  This is one
last reminder for you to submit your Self assessment and/or for your
selected team of raters to return their survey score sheets.

The Summary Reports are shipping out early next week.  In order for any
additional data to be included in your report, FSD, our processing partner,
must receive those surveys by Thursday.

A Summary Report requires feedback from at least 3 Direct Reports or 3
Peers, or 3 in a combination of the two perspectives.  It is equally
important to obtain your Manager's feedback, as well as for you to provide a
Self assessment.  If your Manager submits his/her feedback, but you do not
have a sufficient number of Direct Report and/or Peer responses, you will
only receive a report with your Manager's responses.

be received by April 27.

Thanks for all your effort.

We're working on a content deal that will give us as much sports news as we 
want.  Until we can launch this second phase of EnronOnline, we'll have to 
rely on other third party content for general news items (as in Europe).  As 
best I understand it, this occasional news will be placed on the site at our 
discretion--Julie Ferrara will be responsible for publishing North American 
content, and I'm responsible for European content.  So if there's something 
on that everyone's talking about (Football?), then we could publish a news 
item, if we'd like.

As for the legal issue, I spoke with Mark Taylor (lawyer for Enron North 
America) over a month ago, and he (correct me if I'm wrong, Mark!) seemed to 
differentiate between 'public domain' content and 'proprietary' content, the 
difference between the two being whether or not you could possibly get the 
information from any other source.  I think sports scores is usually in the 
'public domain' category.

So let's keep up the good work, and if you want to prepare a possible 
football related news item, let's move towards publishing it (always going 
through the normal channels, of course).

Thanks Arfan

3744,"Hi James

My understanding of Louise's request was that several sports news pages would 
be posted with sports scores being updated on the website during the week for 
intra week events.  Please clarify.

Will the content provider provide info about European and Asian sports?  Do 
we need to involve Justin/Edmund to get the European legal perspective or 
does the content deal cover this already?

You will have seen the sports which held the most interest for the traders 
here - can you let us know whether the content provider has sufficient info 
to enable us to post score data.

3745,"Dear Rahil

I thought I'd try to clarify everything to see if we agree on what should be 
done.  Please tell me if you think the following summary should be 
modified--or if it's incorrect.

It's my understanding that there's a current interest in sports news (i.e., 
NCAA Finals or the European equivalent) as well as a future one.  It seems 
that the present interest in European sports news could be met with a 
'patchwork solution' of taking public domain sports scores (hence my email to 
Arfan) and posting them, with occasional updates--like the NCAA scores (hence 
Amita's email to me).

In the future (phase 2) we will have constant, automatically updated sports 
scores (as well as other news), for which we will have a legal arrangement, 
handled in Houston, that will allow us to carry content globally--and all of 
these deals must be handled by you and Dave Samuels in Houston (hence your 
email to Amita).

I think Louise's concern (now referring to Amita's email to me) was that 
European sports--before the phase 2 launch--should have just as much of an 
opportunity to be covered as American ones, which is why Amita has had Anna 
Gardiner, and now Arfan, look for news that we could put on the site.  (So 
for example we should have Wimbledon scores online, phase 2 or not, even if 
we have no other way to post them than through a 'patchwork solution').

Hope this helps (but perhaps it's already clear in everyone's mind)

Thanks Rahil

As I understand it, as long as the story is public domain (and all sports 
scores that would be important enough to have a newsticker item would be in 
this category--again, Mark, correct me if I'm wrong), then there is no legal 
issue with regards to publishing that news.

(So Arfan doesn't need to research the legal aspect)

Yes, we should be ready to go, although the law firm we are using in Japan 
(Baker & McKenzie in Tokyo) have indicated that they still have a few open 
issues to follow-up on.

Baker & McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron non-Tokyo trading office 
receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty, that payment 
should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax.  Further, 
they have advised that consumption tax (Japan's 5% VAT) should not apply to 
financial transactions, although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical 
product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the 5% consumption tax. 

Baker & McKenzie have advised that they need to do some follow-up work with 
respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some 
further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where 
our non-Japan trading offices are located.  I expect to have their response 
shortly.

One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of 
the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other 
Enron trading offices.  In this case, it may be appropriate for Enron Japan 
to receive a service fee for such services.  I am in the process of 
determining to what extent Enron Japan would be providing services.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional 
information.  I will let you know of any additional developments as soon as

Nice to hear that the register.com deal is going through.  Again, here are 
the domains that we need for EnronOnline.  (So, enrononline.co.jp, 
enrononline.com.sg, etc.)

As I mentioned to you, let's try to get all of the unrestricted domains 
immediately and all of the information fro the restricted domains as soon as 
possible.  The first tier is of course a higher priority, but I recognize 
that we may be able to get some of the second tier domains faster, if they 
are unrestricted.

As you contact register.com, you should tell them that we want all restricted 
domains ASAP and that we want all of the information and materials necessary 
to register the unrestricted domains.  As a precaution, I would tell them 
that they should not register unrestricted domains for us without our consent 
(Dave Forster's approval), simply because, as in the case of Japan, we don't 
want to take another Enron business unit's one domain, if the country's rule 
is 'one domain name per company'.  (Presumably they wouldn't be able to do 
that any way, because we'd have to provide them with that information, but 
just in case!)

For now (unless Dave Forster objects), let's use my London RC code (because 
as the deal stands, it's an Enron Europe company signing the contract with 
register.com).  It is RC 100487.

3799,"I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their=
=20
final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the non-Japanese=
=20
trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties. The following is a=20
summary of their advice:

A. Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions
1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions

Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20
swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment=
=20
flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that=
=20
Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput=
ed=20
interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta=
x.

2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes

Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a=
re=20
generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20
transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20
imposes various excise taxes, some of which apply to commodities that are t=
he=20
subject to Enron Online transactions, such as petroleum excise tax.  Such=
=20
excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and=
=20
delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely=20
financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices.

3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions

If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20
connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20
arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20
Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and=
=20
pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20
withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.

B. Physically Settled Transactions
1. Consumption Tax

Japan imposes consumption tax (VAT) on the importation of tangible goods an=
d=20
on domestic transfers of tangible goods. Consumption tax should be applicab=
le=20
to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit=
e,=20
including natural gas, LNG, petroleum and derivatives, coal and pulp and=20
paper.  Consequently, commodity contracts for physical settlement should=20
provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the=20
Japan-based customer.  As owner of the products upon import, the Japan-base=
d=20
customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that=20
capacity would handle formalities upon import, pay import consumption tax a=
nd=20
then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax.=20

If, instead, the title to the commodities is transferred after such=20
commodities enter Japan, each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be=20
required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes, pay=20
consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns.  While such a=
n=20
arrangement is feasible, in practice, other industries have encountered=20
resistance from customs authorities (who administer the import consumption=
=20
tax system) to the designation of a non-resident entity as formal importer.

2. Excise Tax

Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various=20
commodities, including natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and refined petroleum=
=20
products.  Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon=
=20
the specific product. Other commodities listed at the website, including=20
coal, plastics (except if a specific product were characterized as a=20
petrochemical subject to excise tax), and pulp and paper, are not subject t=
o=20
excise tax.  Again, Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities=
=20
before they reach Japan so that the Japan-based customer acts as importer a=
nd=20
has responsibility for payment of excise taxes.

C. Tax Representations

The trading offices considered were those located in the US, the UK,=20
Singapore, Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway. Japan has tax treaties in=
=20
force with all of these countries.  Consequently, with respect to GTCs=20
entered into with these trading offices, the tax payor and payee=20
representations may provide that:

(1) the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl=
y=20
and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities, and
(2) with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron=20
entities, it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article=
=20
of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in=
=20
the paying Enron entity=01,s jurisdiction. =20


Please let me know if you have any questions, need any additional informati=
on=20
or would like me to forward our outside advisor=01,s memo on this subject t=

Thanks for your email.  Your list for power and gas products are fine. I
agree we can add products/markets going forward as appropriate.  We also
discussed posting your numbers for crude and products.  I believe we agreed
crude and products would not be part of any volume targets, but that we
would incorporate those products in the first round.  Please provide me a
list for crude and products based on what we offer on HoustonStreet.  Also,
any thoughts on whether you want to take me up on my offer to include your
numbers in Europe (UK, Germany and Scandanavia) and Japan for an additional
10% equity in each of those markets?  The reason I ask is that we are
engaged in liquidity partner discussions right now and your answer might
affect our decisions.  We are on target to go live in Europe this Summer.

Sorry I forgot to answer your financials question.  We already have
financial swaps for gas.  Financial electricity we can add very quickly with
someone's design assistance.  We only need minimal help to validate product

I'm sorry if I was unclear on Europe/Japan.  I agreed that if you give us
your numbers in those markets you would get 10%, but I need to know whether
you are going to do that as part of this deal so I can complete other
liquidity partner discussions accordingly.  It wasn't intended as an open
option.  We can discuss Europe and Japan in the future, I'm just not sure I
can guarantee you 10% at that time.  I've got my Board primed if we do it
right now.  Perhaps we could agree that we will do it and you get your 10%
in each entity now, but that the actual technology link doesn't start until
later this year?

1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have 
enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial 
even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be 
enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be 
enforced in court?

2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process 
agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or 
maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct 
assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language.

should not insert our arbitration provision.  Is this correct?

2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant 
reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we 
have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is 
when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty?  Is 
this correct?  What we are unsure about is whther these reps are needed when 
ECC's counterparty is a US entity.  We look forward to hearing from you.

3835,"I think that the ""general policies"" route is the right (and only) one - 
particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged.  From a 
legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all 
clear, provided
in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty 
of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc).  
We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not 
per se a legal task)
in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location
in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location

Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in 
the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as 
generically as possible.

3843,"Steve,

Since our phone call, I spoke to Mark Taylor, who advised me that the local 
counsel is planning to come back to us next week with a detailed opinion 
regarding the taxation issues for trading in Brazil and Argentina.

Under these circumstances, it seems wise to postpone our planned conference 
call until after outside counsel has responded.

However, I remain concerned about this issue. As discussed, if we are unable 
to formulate a plan which we believe has a good chance of succeeding, and if 
the tax regime is so penal as to make trading on EnronOnline prohibitively 
expensive, then we need to seriously reevaluate the timetable for EnronOnline 
and postpone preparation efforts until such time as either the tax regime 
changes or we identify a way around the tax restrictions.

I will contact you later next week after we hear from outside counsel. 
Hopefully their response will put my concerns to rest.

Can you forward a copy to me of your current GTC?

I note that the language is similar to other EnronOnline Products, which is 
good for consistency. However, I note that there has been a subsitution of 
Calculation Period where other products use Determination Period. However, I 
gather that for power, Calculation Period is 1/2 hour, whereas for other 
Products, Determination Period is generally one month. I hope this does not 
cause problems if the GTC language has been borrowed from other Products.

Would the following amendments clarify the MW/Mwh/Calculation Period 
relationship?

Current:  The Counterparty will submit a volume in megawatts (MW) via 
EnronOnline. This number will be divided in half to convert it into MWh. This 
number will be used to calculate the Notional Quantity per Calculation Period.

Suggestion: The Counterparty will submit a volume in megawatts (MW) via 
EnronOnline. This number will be divided in half to convert it into total MWh 
delivered in each 1/2 hour Calculation Period, which shall be the Notional 
Quantity.


Current: The Index shall be the spot price at the Victoria . . .

Suggestion: The Index shall be the spot price published for each 1/2 hour at

I am wondering if it is necessary to include a few more words in our index 
descriptors.

When we refer to a published index, should we add: ""including published 
corrections"", or is this obvious enough? 

I'm thinking that if there is an error in the index which is acknowledged as 
such in the publication, then the error would be seen as something which 
should be corrected if we ever went to court. I'm also thinking that we would 
not want to apply this kind of language on a go-forward basis, as to have two 
different treatments might prejudice our position (although the UK office 
wishes to add this language on a go-forward)

Thoughts?

As mentioned at our trading meeting on Tuesday, we are putting together a 
tailored ISDA schedule for our banking counterparties with which we propose 
to trade credit transactions.

One issue we have revisited is whether the definition of Specified 
Indebtedness (which ties into the cross default provisions) should be 
expanded to cover derivatives transactions as well as the more conventional 
bank borrowings.  

We think there are arguments both ways on this, but wonder whether we have a 
""house view"".  Since the definition is not expanded in our standard ISDA 
schedule, we assume that our preferred position is to exclude derivatives 
transactions from the cross default provisions of the ISDA.

Perhaps we can discuss this when you have a spare moment! Thanks

Kind regards.

3856,"Following our recent discussions, I wanted to provide more information about 
how we would plan to administer the contest around Euro 2000.  We would 
restrict access to the contest to participants in countries that we have 
cleared.  The likely way that this will work will be to restrict access at 
the point of registration for the contest.  Here's how I think it would look 
to the user:

There would be a Euro 2000 icon on the EnronOnline quotes screen (the main 
page of our system).
The user would click on this icon, and a new browser window would open with 
the EnronOnline/Sports.com home page.  This will contain schedules, results, 
player profiles, etc.  It will also contain an icon for Minute Mania Contest.
When the user clicks on this icon, they would then go to a page that 
describes at a high level what the contest is.  Pick times for events (first 
goal, etc) and win prizes (digital video camera, etc).   We would also note 
here that the contest is only open to residents of UK, Germany, etc.  Click 
here to register.  
The user will then go to a screen that has several input boxes that include:  
Name, contact details (email, phone), user name for contest, and country of 
residence.  The country of residence box would either be a drop down that 
only includes choices for the countries that are eligible or would allow the 
user to type their country.  If the user has the ability to type their 
country then the system would then have a verification process that rejects 
those that are ineligible to participate.

The order of priority for the countries where we have users is:

UK
Germany
Belgium
Netherlands
Switzerland
Norway
Sweden
Finland
Denmark
Austria
Italy
Spain
France

Then there is also

US (largest customer base) -  state by state differences 
Canada (second largest group)

should confirm the laws here as well)

3875,"Carol I'm having trouble with a few counterparties who, like Enron require an 
exclusion of ""consequential"" losses. Currently under our ETA  the exclusion 
for  liability consequential losses/damage only applies to Enron. There is 
however, a mutual exclusion of limitation of libility in the GTCs and our 
ISDAs. The major issue  I see is to ensure that we are covered for trades 
that are performed by persons with a password obtained through the

and should at least be liable for the other party's out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred in establishing the interfaces as well as give the other party the 
right to terminate the agreement -- and under what circumstances should 
either party be able to walk away (such as, it just doesn't work)?

transactions done through EnronOnline, bearing in mind that it will be Enron

then fine - but don't allow this to delay the process.

3912,"This provision is an election which we have added to the Schedule for 
governmental entities.  I believe that it is intended to eliminate any 
confusion that historically arose during the debate between ""First Method"" 
(one-way payments) and ""Second Method"" (two-way payments) for Early 
Termination purposes.  Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use 
this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can 
understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a 
governmental.  The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 
1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District.  For those of 
you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master 
agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA.  Because 
these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many 
of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions.  The Part 
5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement.  It was 
included in the ""Event of Change"" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the 
ISDA concept of ""Illegality"", a ""Termination Event"").  I think it was 
probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment 
method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early 
Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT 
form.

Following our earlier telephone conversation, here is the list of countries 
for which we need to undertake follow-up commodity due diligence for trading 
physical metals products.  As the initial two products to be offered are 
aluminium and copper we should restrict the due diligence to base metals 
only.  In addition, let's ask for the position on cash-settled derivatives - 
should involve only a follow-up question asking whether previous advice for 
energy commodity derivatives changes in respect of derivatives on metals.  
However, the initial focus should be on the physical trading questions.

Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom

It appears that we would qualify for such a  Declaration thereby allowing EAF 
to use the safe harbour provisions under the Australian Corporations Law for  
trading through EnronOnline if EAF had get a guarantee from  Enron Europe 
Finance and Trading Ltd. We would be able to take advantage of a specific 
provision in the policy guideline of the Australian Securities and 
Investments Commission on the grant of Declarations known as Policy Statement 
70. (Below is a summary of the relevant provisions of the Policy Statement.) 
Would the provision of such a guarantee be possible? 

Clearly an issue to consider would be any possible impact on EEFT's 
prudential requirements under the Financial Services Act. If this were an 
issue perhaps could it be overcome if there was a back to back guaranty from 
say Enron Corp. to EEFT. This mean that effectively EEFT would have no 
additional exposure.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- McGraw-Hill Cos., on behalf of its Standard & Poor's 
Corp. unit, has filed a lawsuit in
federal court charging the Vanguard Group Inc. with breach of contract and 
trademark infringement in connection
with the mutual fund company's proposed new Vipers exchange-traded funds, or 
ETFs. 

McGraw-Hill's suit alleges Vanguard breached the companies' 1988 license 
agreement by using Standard & Poor's
proprietary indices and trademarks for the Vipers exchange-traded products 
without permission.

Officials from Vanguard, the nation's second largest fund firm, weren't 
immediately available to comment on the
lawsuit. 

Exchange-traded funds are a hybrid version of index mutual funds that can be 
bought or sold during the day at

Standard & Poor's currently has more than 400 license agreements for uses of

McGraw-Hill wants to prevent Vanguard from using S&P's indices and trademarks

other exchange-traded security. The complaint also seeks an order requiring 
Vanguard to withdraw its Securities

Vanguard liable for unspecified
damages and attorneys' fees. 

McGraw-Hill's complaint states that Vipers differ significantly from shares 
of the open-end mutual funds that
Vanguard offered under the 1988 agreement.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Mutual-fund giant Vanguard Group is seeking regulatory 
permission to offfer a new type
of share class for five of its nine stock-index funds that would act like 
exchange-traded funds. 

Vanguard, which has thrived for years by offering low-cost stock funds, said 
the share class, called ""Viper"" shares
for Vanguard Index Participation Equity Receipts, will be listed on the 
American Stock Exchange. The funds which
filed to register a Viper class of exchange-traded shares are Vanguard 500 
Index Fund, Vanguard Growth Index
Fund, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Vanguard Value Index Fund and 
Vanguard Small-Cap Index
Fund.

Index mutual funds, traditionally the lowest cost provider of mutual fund 
portfolios, are being challenged by
exchange-traded funds, which are mutual-fund-like vehicles that trade over an 
exchange like a stock.
Exchange-traded funds cost less than index funds because the asset-management 
firms that sponsor them don't
deal directly with the individual investor through expensive telephone 
centers and retail offices. 

The Viper shares differ from conventional mutual fund shares in that they 
trade continuously at market prices on the
American Stock Exchange rather than the calculated net asset value of the 
fund determined at the end of the
trading day. Given this flexibility, Vipers shares are expected to appeal 
primarily to short-term investors. Vanguard
has yet to determine the expense ratios for the Viper shares. 

The move by Vanguard, the second largest mutual fund company, comes amid 
heightened competition in the
marketplace for index investors. Barclays Global Investors, a huge presence 
in the pension-investing world. is
preparing over the next four weeks to unveil 28 new index funds that will 
also trade on the American Stock
Exchange. The exchange-traded funds will track everything from the total U.S. 
stock market to industrial and
Internet sectors. 

The flagship Barclays product, iShares S&P 500 Fund, will mirror the 
big-company Standard & Poor's 500-stock
Index and will have an annual expense ratio of 0.08% to 0.10% of assets, 
people familiar with the situation told The
Wall Street Journal. That's about half the price currently paid by investors 
in the $105 billion Vanguard 500 Index
Fund.

Daily Update -- McGraw-Hill Sues Vanguard Over Planned Vipers Funds

06/08/2000
Dow Jones Business News

Dow Jones Interactive
Financial Services Update
For June 8, 2000
Today's top stories as of 4 p.m. EDT:

- McGraw-Hill Cos., on behalf of its Standard & Poor's Corp. unit, has filed 
a lawsuit in federal court charging the
Vanguard Group Inc. with breach of contract and trademark infringement in 
connection with the mutual fund
company's proposed new Vipers exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. 

McGraw-Hill's suit alleges Vanguard breached the companies' 1988 license 
agreement by using Standard & Poor's
proprietary indices and trademarks for the Vipers exchange-traded products 
without permission. 

Officials from Vanguard, the nation's second largest fund firm, weren't 
immediately available to comment on the
lawsuit. 

Exchange-traded funds are a hybrid version of index mutual funds that can be 
bought or sold during the day at
market prices instead of at the once-daily 4 p.m. price used by traditional 
mutual funds. ETFs are single shares of
stock that replicate an index such as the Standard & Poor's 500. 

Standard & Poor's currently has more than 400 license agreements for uses of 
its indices and trademarks, including
agreements related to ETFs, according to McGraw-Hill. 

McGraw-Hill wants to prevent Vanguard from using S&P's indices and trademarks 
in connection with Vipers or any
other exchange-traded security. The complaint also seeks an order requiring 
Vanguard to withdraw its Securities
and Exchange Commission application for Vipers, and seeks an order declaring 
Vanguard liable for unspecified
damages and attorneys' fees. 

- Liberty Financial Cos. confirmed it is in talks to acquire Wanger Asset 
Management L.P., which operates the
Acorn mutual funds. 

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Liberty (L), a Boston-based 
asset-management company, would pay
about $450 million for Wanger, a Chicago investment company that has been on 
the SELLING block for several
months. 

The Journal said the reported price of the transaction, which equals about 6% 
of Wanger's $7.3 billion of assets
under management, would be considered a healthy one for a mutual-fund company 
and follows a recent trend of
well-priced deals. Pioneer Investment Management was bought last month for 
$1.2 billion, about 5% of assets, even
as the firm's management was being sharply criticized by shareholders and its 
funds were suffering big withdrawals.

The typical price for a fund firm had been about 3% of assets, depending on 
how the assets were invested. Wanger
was considered attractive because most of its assets are in highly profitable 
stock mutual funds. 

Liberty, majority owned by Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., has about $67 
billion in assets and 95 mutual funds. 

- Midwest bank National City Corp. will sell about $2 billion in student 
loans as part of a restructuring of its balance
sheet. The company said the sale, expected to close in the second quarter, 
will result in a pretax gain of about $75
million. 

In addition to the student loan sale, National City is also evaluating other 
alternatives. Some would require the
recognition of losses, given current market conditions. 

Cleveland-based National City (NCC) reported a decline in first quarter net 
income as borrowing costs rose more
than loan rates. Last November the bank warned analysts to reduce profit 
estimates as the spread between its
borrowing costs and lending rates shrank. The problem for National City and 
many banks is the failure of deposit
growth to keep pace with loan demand. That forces them to fund loans with 
money borrowed at higher rates in the
capital markets. 

National City expects its balance sheet reorganization to be complete by the 
end of the third quarter. 

- Led by a fall in the typical interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, 
rates declined in a weekly survey from
Freddie Mac. 

The mortgage buyer (FRE) said the average rate lenders were seeking on a 
fixed, 30-year mortgage fell to 8.32% for
the week that ends Friday. That is down from 8.54% last week. 

The average rate for a fixed, 15-year mortgage was 8.04%, down from 8.24%. 
The rate for one-year, adjustable rate
mortgages, or ARMs, slipped to 7.24% from last week's 7.25%, which was the 
highest since April of 1991. 

The Freddie Mac survey appears to confirm that mortgage rates, which rose to 
their highest level in five years in
May, may have eased a bit. 

HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J. financial publisher, said the average rate for 
a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to
8.4%, down from a high of 8.79% for the week ended May 19. 

""I wouldn't call it a rally, but we are getting some relief,"" Keith 
Gumbinger, an analyst at HSH told The Wall Street
Journal. 

Recent economic data - including a Labor Department report last week showing 
a rise in the unemployment rate -
suggest the economy is cooling. That has calmed fears about inflation, 
sending interest rates for Treasury bonds
and mortgage-backed securities - which mortgages follow - lower.

3953,"FOREIGN NARCOTICS KINGPIN DESIGNATION ACT OF 1999

On June 1, 2000, the Treasury Department expanded its list of Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons under the Narcotics Trafficking 
Sanctions Regulations by adding a large number of Colombian entities and 
individuals designated as ""SDNTKs"" (Specially Designated Narcotics 
Traffickers under the Kingpin Act).  The Kingpin Act blocks all property and 
interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by 
significant foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by President Clinton. 

The targets of this measure are major narcotics traffickers and trafficking 
organizations based in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, the Dominican 
Republic, Laos, Mexico, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, Peru, 
Russia, and Thailand.

U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transaction or dealing in 
property or interests in property of SDNTKs and from engaging in any 
transaction that evades or avoids the prohibition of the Kingpin Act.  These 
prohibitions affect trade transactions as well as accounts, securities, and 
other assets.

Reflecting the concern of many in Congress that current civil penalties 
related to the export control and economic sanctions violations (normally, 
$10,000 to $11,000) do not sufficiently deter prohibited conduct, the Act 
authorizes civil penalties of up to $1,000,000.

3967,"Dianne, further to our conversation this morning, this e-mail will confirm 
the following:

1.  The current form of Master Physical Gas Agreement with Duke is an older 
master which indicates that transactions must be confirmed in writing and 
arguably provides that such confirms are not binding until executed by both 
parties.  However, the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement indicates 
that, where a confirm is issued, it is deemed accepted unless objected to 
within three business days.  There is no indication in the EOL Electronic 
Trading Agreement how a conflict between the provisions of that agreement and 
any master agreement will be resolved, but I think that for the purposes of 
the EnronOnline transactions, we can rely on the terms of the Electronic 
Trading Agreement and, if Duke has not objected to the terms set forth in the 
EOL confirm within three business days, determine that such confirms are 
valid and binding upon the counterparty.

2.  However, with respect to any physical gas transactions entered into with 
Duke under the Master but not through EnronOnline, we still need them to 
execute and return the confirm.

3.  Regarding financial deals entered into through EnronOnline and made 
pursuant to the electronic form of GTC, the terms of the Electronic Trading 
Agreement will govern and, unless Duke objects to the terms of the confirm 
within three business days, the confirm is deemed to be valid and binding on 
Duke.

4.  Notwithstanding the above, I think we should still try to maintain our 
practice with other counterparties of obtaining executed confirms back from 
such counterparties.

Mark, if you have any concerns with these conclusions, can you please let me 
know at your earliest convenience.  Duke currently has approximately 350 
outstanding confirms entered into with ECC through the facilities of 
EnronOnline that they have not executed and returned and they have told us 
that they are relying on the Electronic Trading Agreement as providing there 
is no requirement to execute and return these confirms.

currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differs 
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in 
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms of 
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely 
change the analysis below.)

Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more 
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page ""Executive Summary 
of Legal Advice"" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant 
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction 
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus on 
issues we raised which are ""all clear"" from a legal perspective, so as to 
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news 
too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out below 
what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, on 
the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely 
to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a 
risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk 
is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.

A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000

 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US

B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be 
delayed

 Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)

C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)

The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and 
related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks 
of a general nature:

(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our 
counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the 
product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional 
documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies to 
almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in 
all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general 
law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under 
their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their 
constitutional documents if they wish to trade).  

The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading 
relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particularly 
onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.

(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure 
that we are not misusing confidential information about our business 
counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur 
both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not include 
formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or 
the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US 
counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include 
(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the 
procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure that 
confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which 
we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality 
agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron 
has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, or 
otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will 
need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Without 
such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that 
entity for breach of confidence.

D.  Country Specific Issues

(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute 
insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the 
product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve 
this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in 
Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear 
which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.

(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in 
Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.

(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be 
regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and 
unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a 
""substantial professional effort"" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being 
entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our 
counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade 
by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should 
therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this 
product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic 
behind its trading this product type.

(iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading 
relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisory 
authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being 
unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterparty 
(which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offence 
will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  However, 
I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing 
business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.

(v)  US (New York Law) 

(a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an 
option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions under 
the US Commodities Exchange Act. 

(b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product 
constitutes a ""security"" under US securities laws (please see attached 
Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of 
securities to ""accredited investors"" which will allow us to deal with 
investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our 
counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test should 
not impede the business.

(c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider 
trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security 
(see (b) above) is relatively remote.

Thanks for the quick turnaround.

I have only a few comments to the draft request for advice to Kim & Chang:

1) I think you should clarify that the servers for EOL are located and 
maintained outside Korea.

2) I think you should mention that in other jurisdictions we have reviewed 
(e.g., US, Australia) for the legality of weather derivatives, counsel has 
advised us that the instruments are not likely to be treated as insurance 
contracts.  This is primarily because the payout is not linked to a casualty 
event as would be the case in an insurance contract.  David Minns may have 
additional language to add here.

3) Under Weather Derivatives, delete ""Osaka"" and replace with ""Australia"".

4) Just a point of clarification, but as currently envisioned by the Korean 
commercial team (e.g., Chris Hunt, Jae-Moo and Michelle Lee) when we met with 
them here in Houston earlier this week, financial derivatives (e.g., interest 
rate, f/x) would not be traded online with Korean counterparties. Basically, 
any financial derivatives that would be traded would involve personnel likely 
located in Japan entering into via phone (e.g., conventional means) an 
interest rate hedge or f/x hedge with a Korean financial counterparty in 
order to facilitate the management of the risks carried in Enron Corp.'s 
global financial risk book in Houston. This would just be an extension of the 
services that would be performed by Enron Japan on behalf of Enron. 
Accordingly, I think we need to delete the ""On-Line Financial Derivatives"" 
portion of the draft request b/c I think the analysis captured in the earlier 
memos from Kim & Chang generally addresses this type of derivative activity. 
If you think otherwise, please adjust the request appropriately.  

4) As to ECTRIC's GTCs, I think you should just attach the collateral version 
for now. 

Susan : Do you have any comments to add to the request for advice from a tax 
perspective?

I have also copied David Minns on this note to keep him apprised of this 
request b/c of the Weather Derivatives piece.

Matt, assuming you receive no further comments internally, I think you should 
go ahead and finalize the request and e-mail to Kim & Chang for their review 
by the end of this week.

Regards, Alan

2 - tokenised, where we have set up a record for the period in the database, 
and the rules applicable to it (e.g. Balance of Month, Day ahead) - the rules 
ensure that the specific start and end dates for such a product are shown in

The following is a new  power demand index requested by Claudio Ribeiro.  
Please let me know if it looks OK for the Website.

A US Power Demand Financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp., 
under which the Seller is obliged to pay the Payment Amount to the Buyer 
where the Floating Amount is above the Fixed Amount, or where the Buyer is 
obliged to pay the Payment Amount to the Seller where the Floating Amount is 
below the Fixed Amount.  The Fixed Amount is the amount in Megawatts 
submitted in the ""price"" field by Counterparty via the Website. The Notional 
Amount is the product of the quantity submitted by Counterparty via the 
Website and the Pay Unit. The Payment Amount is the product of (i) the 
Notional Amount and (ii) the absolute value of the difference between the 
Floating Amount and the Fixed Amount.  The Payment Amount will be payable on 
or before ten (10) business days after the Floating Amount for the 
Determination Period is determinable.
The Determination Period is from and including the Effective Date of 04 Jun 
2001 (Initial Date) to and including the Termination Date of 08 Jun 2001 (End 
Date).
The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly PJM loads 
for Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the Determination Period. The 
Floating Amount shall be calculated utilizing the hourly integrated loads 
published by PJM Interconnection, LLC (""PJM"") on its official web site 
currently located at ftp://www.pjm.com/pub/account/loadhryr/index.html, or 
any successor thereto, under the heading ""PJM Hourly Load Data"".
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatts and 
the quantity shown shall be in total MWs.
The transaction is for on-peak (""Peak"") hours on each Delivery Day beginning 
with the hour ending 0800 (7:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2300 
(11:00 pm) Eastern Prevailing Time.  ""Delivery Day"" means a day during the 
term of the transaction that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or 
Friday, excluding any day that is a NERC holiday.
The Pay Unit is 10 USD.

4038,"The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=
he=20
terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll=
=20
have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =
 I=20
also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=
=20
traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20
Descriptions:

Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=
y=20
clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=
n=20
the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  If so, maybe we should add a lin=
e=20
something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this=20
Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the=
=20
relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence=20
referring to the quality as well.

Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere?

The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=
=20
there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=
=20
GTC.  Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes=
=20
more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa=
me=20
units.  If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number=
=20
some counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.=
 =20
The GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit=
. =20
It seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the=20
volume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction. =20

Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20
beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=
=20
the GTC.

The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20
parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=
=20
this more than I.)

If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=
=20
would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=
t=20
the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=
=20
month'.

Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =
be=20
clear from the Long Description.


So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=
=20
something like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20
shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of th=
e=20
General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20

The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=

The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit=

If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b=
e=20
more like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=

The term Business Day should be capitalized (it's defined in the GTC) [but

the need for a procedure.  Let me know what you think about the following:

1. Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards 
the name to Credit.  At the same time, the commercial team should be 
identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the 
proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).  

2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have 
been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).  If approved, Credit 
notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal 
together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron 
relationships.

3. Legal conducts a ""screening"" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and 
forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If 
the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its 
affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the 
appropriate level of further review.  If the commercial team considers the RE 
the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the 
confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.  In addition, 
if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the 
""other Enron relationships"" to determine if they raise any legal concerns.  
Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).

Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on 
the website.  Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only 
offered pursuant to an unsolicited request.

Thanks for your note.  Glad to hear you and yours are well.  

We docked in Southampton on Monday morning so I was already in our London office on Tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through.  I was traveling with a couple of friends from NYC (Amanda McGovern, Noble Black's UVA classmate, and Linda Hayman, her mom and a friend of mine from my Skadden days) so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well.  Our return had been scheduled for Wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in London but made it back Sunday.  Not that we were having much fun, but there were worse places to be stranded.  I felt bad for the QE2 passengers on their way from Southampton to NYC.  They would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying.

I've heard good things from both Anne and Brad about your meeting here in Houston.  Thanks for getting into that.  It sounds like exactly what we needed.  I have been talking to Barbara and she will check with Frank concerning the letter.

I'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so I can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping.  Hope it is all going as smoothly as possible.  Linda tells me that New York is a changed place -- nearly empty evenings and weekends.

Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
""The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market,"" FERC said in its draft order. ""Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate."" 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, ""given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California."" 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was ""extremely successful,"" adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
""The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States,"" said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
""We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region,"" said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
""Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent,"" said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. ""We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.''

4111,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 - ""The oil and gas industry is on high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death"", news sources said Monday.

The FBI alerted the American Petroleum Institute, who works directly with Energy Department on security, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies. 

""We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States,"" said the memo, adding that the information was ""from a source of undetermined reliability."" 

The FBI warning continued that ""such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed."" 

Representatives from the world's leading energy companies, policy makers and industry experts will gather January 24, 2002 in Washington DC at the World Energy Security and Commerce forum (http://www.wesc.org) to discuss the new realities facing executives responsible for securing energy assets, transporting them to market and balancing changing political climates.

Dynegy Takes Over Northern Natural Gas Pipeline 

 

Dynegy, which acquired the Northern Natural Gas pipeline from Enron
after investing $1.5 billion in the energy trader, will take

over the pipelines trading and marketing today. The system, valued at
$2.7 billion, runs 16,600 miles from Texas to the Great Lakes. Enron had
contested the takeover after Dynegy backed out of its plan to buy Enron
for $23 billion in November. Earlier this month, Enron gave up the
pipeline, but is proceeding with a $10 billion lawsuit against Dynegy
for terminating their deal. Northern Natural has a capacity of 4.3 Bcf
of natural gas per day and has valuable connection points with other
pipelines. Although Dynegy operates many pipelines, Northern Natural is
their first foray into pipeline ownership. Dynegy paid $23 million to
complete the purchase and named Daniel Dienstbier as the systems
president, a position he held before becoming president of Enron's Gas
Pipeline Group in 1985. Dynegy also assumed $900 million of Northern
Natural's debt. Enron employees will run and maintain Northern Natural
until Enron's option to buy it back expires June 30th. But most think
that is unlikely to happen, given Enron's current state of affairs. 

 

FERC Approves Tuscarora Pipeline Expansion

 

The  has given final approval to Tuscarora Gas Transmission's plan to
expand its pipeline system to bring more natural gas to industrial
customers in northern Nevada. The Tuscarora natural gas pipeline was
built in 1995 in a partnership between Sierra Pacific Resources and
TransCanada PipeLines. The $60 million, 14-mile pipeline extension would
almost double the capacity in the area from 125 MMcf per day to 220 MMcf
per day. The expanded pipeline capacity will serve Duke Energy's 540 MW
plant near Wadsworth, Nevada and Morgan Stanley's 360 MW power plant
near Reno. The 229-mile pipeline stretches from Malin, Oregon through
northern California to Sierra Pacific's Tracy power station near Reno.

4146,"We have a great deal of work underway with our continuing operations, bankruptcy related issues, managing asset sales transitions and major operating environment issues.  While I have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges, we will need to simultaneously direct our attention on a number of key areas to be successful.

In light of the above, I have asked Danny McCarty to take on a new role as managing director of special projects for Enron Global Services (EGS).  Danny's responsibilities will include a number of complex bankruptcy related activities, the workout of certain troubled assets and optimizing the value of selected businesses.

Until the question of our right to repurchase Northern Natural Gas is resolved, it is better to minimize organizational changes.  Consequently, I do not plan to replace Danny as managing director and chief commercial officer of Enron Transportation Services (ETS) at this time.  Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Rob Kilmer, Shelley Corman and the business development efforts will report directly to me.

I truly appreciate Danny's willingness to take on this responsibility.  His involvement should ensure that we dedicate the necessary attention to key business issues, while allowing Jim Hughes and me to focus on the priorities of a reorganization plan and our day-to-day operations.

As always, thank you for your continued dedication and support.

 ",Elizabeth,,FYI

The following is a brief desciption of the above mentioned project.
 
The Bloomfield air inlet cooler project consist of the installation of evaporative pads around the existing air filters to reduce the ambient air temperature into units 1 & 2 turbines.  This will allow the turbines to run more efficiently and increase the amount of horsepower developed on hot summer days.  The evaporative system will not be operated on non-summer condition days.  The increase in horsepower will be about 350 Hp per unit which will not exceed the current air quality permit.  The permit limitation is in excess of 5800 Hp and the evaporative system will not increase the horespower no more than 5000 Hp on hot summer days.
 
If you need more information of clarification, please call.",Bill,,
